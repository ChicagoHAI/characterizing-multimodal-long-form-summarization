Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs to treat serious medical conditions through our proprietary LAT technology. We utilize our proprietary LAT technology to generate improved prodrug versions of drugs approved by the FDA as well as to generate prodrug versions of existing compounds that may have applications for new disease indications. Our product candidate pipeline is focused on the high need areas of ADHD, SUD and IH. Our co-lead clinical development candidates, AZSTARYS (formerly referred to as KP415) and KP484, are both based on a prodrug of d-MPH but with differing ER effect profiles, and are intended for the treatment of ADHD. Our clinical product candidate for the treatment of SUD is KP879, based on a prodrug of d-MPH. Our preclinical prodrug product candidate for the treatment of IH is KP1077. We have entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Commave for the development, manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates containing SDX and d-MPH. In addition, we have announced our commercial partnership with KVK of APADAZ, an FDA approved IR combination product of benzhydrocodone, our prodrug of hydrocodone, and APAP for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.\nWe expect that our sources of revenues will be through payments arising from our license agreements with Commave and KVK, our consulting agreement with Corium and through other consulting arrangements and any other future arrangements we might enter into related to one of our other product candidates. To date, we have generated revenue from the KP415 License Agreement in the form of the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million, of which we paid Aquestive $1.0 million as a royalty payment, a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA, of which we paid Aquestive $0.5 million as a royalty payment, reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs and payments related to the performance of consulting services. In addition, we have generated revenue under the Corium Consulting Agreement and other consulting arrangements for the performance of consulting services as well as reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party costs associated with those services.\nOn March 2, 2021, we announced that the FDA approved the NDA for AZSTARYS, a once-daily product for the treatment of ADHD in patients ranging from six years and older. Corium will lead the commercialization of AZSTARYS per the KP415 License Agreement. Corium expects to make AZSTARYS commercially available in the U.S. as early as the second half of 2021.\nWe have had recurring negative cash flows from operations and, as of December 31, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $258.5 million. Our cash flows used in operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1.9 million and $23.7 million, respectively.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and minimal positive net cash flows from operations or negative net cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future, and those expenses and losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We anticipate that our expenses will fluctuate substantially as we:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> continue our ongoing preclinical studies, clinical trials and our product development activities for our pipeline of product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> continue research and preclinical development and initiate clinical trials of our other product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> seek to discover and develop additional product candidates either internally or in partnership with other pharmaceutical companies;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from royalties earned from the sales of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In September 2019, we entered into the KP415 License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted an exclusive, worldwide license to Commave to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates containing SDX and d-MPH, including AZSTARYS and KP484. In October 2018, we entered into the APADAZ License Agreement with KVK, pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to KVK to commercialize APADAZ in the United States We cannot guarantee that either Commave or KVK will be able to successfully commercialize AZSTARYS or any of our product candidates covered under the KP415 License Agreement, or APADAZ, or that we will ever receive any payments under the APADAZ License Agreement from commercial sales of APADAZ or any future payments under the KP415 License Agreement. We also do not know when, if ever, any other product candidate will be commercially available. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt, the terms of these securities may restrict our ability to operate. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or altogether cease our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nRecent Financial Developments\nIn January and February 2021, we undertook a series of transactions to regain our Nasdaq Capital Market listing and improve our balance sheet. These included a reverse stock split, an underwritten public offering, or the Public Offering, a restructuring or our debt and ultimately a payoff of all remaining debt and a transaction in which we induced the holders of some of the warrants we issued in the public offering to exercise those warrants for cash.\nReverse Stock Split and Nasdaq Relisting\nEffective May 21, 2020, our common stock had been delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market and we began listing on the OTC Markets Venture Market under the symbol KMPH\u201d. In anticipation of the Public Offering, we determined we would need to regain our Nasdaq listing.\nIn order to relist our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock was required to satisfy the initial listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which including among others, that we have stockholders' equity of at least $5.0 million, a market value of unrestricted publicly held shares of at least $15.0 million, at least 1.0 million unrestricted publicly held shares, at least 300 unrestricted round lot stockholders, at least three market makers and a bid price of at least $4.00 per share, or, collectively, the Nasdaq Listing Requirements. Accordingly, on December 23, 2020, we effectuated a 1-for-16 reverse stock split of our common stock in order to satisfy the bid price component of the Nasdaq Listing Requirements.\nOn January 7, 2021, our common stock was approved for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on January 8, 2021 under the ticker symbol KMPH\u201d.\nDebt Restructuring\nIn anticipation of the Public Offering, and to meet the Nasdaq Listing Requirements, we agreed in December 2020 to restructure our outstanding senior secured convertible notes issued in December 2019 and January 2020, or the Senior Secured Notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $60.8 million and the senior secured convertible promissory note held by Deerfield Private Design Fund III, L.P., or Deerfield, in the principal amount of $7.5 million, or the Deerfield Note, and, collectively the Senior Secured Notes, the Facility Notes. The total outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Facility Notes was $69.4 million as of December 31, 2020.\nUnder the terms of the agreement we entered into with our lenders in connection with this debt restructuring, which we refer to as the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, on January 12, 2021, in connection with the closing of our Public Offering, we:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> exchanged $31.5 million of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Facility Notes for (i) 31,476.98412 shares of our Series B-2 convertible preferred stock, and (ii) warrants exercisable for 3,632,019 shares of our common stock, or the Exchange Warrants; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> made a payment of $30.3 million, or the Debt Payment, in partial repayment of the remaining outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Facility Notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEach share of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock issued pursuant to the December 2020 Exchange Agreement has a stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of our common stock at any time following the earlier of March 2, 2021 or our public announcement of the outcome of the FDA's review of our AZSTARYS NDA at the option of the holder thereof, subject to specified limits, at a conversion price of $6.4999. The shares of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock issued under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement are convertible into an aggregate of 4,842,690 shares of our common stock.\nThe Exchange Warrants have substantially the same terms and conditions as the warrants sold by us in our January 2021 underwritten offering.\nFollowing the completion of these transactions, the aggregate balance of principal and accrued interest remaining outstanding under the Facility Notes was approximately $7.6 million. With respect to this remaining outstanding balance under the Facility Notes, the December 2020 Exchange Agreement amended the terms of that debt to provide that:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> the maturity date was changed to March 31, 2023, and the debt is prepayable upon specified conditions; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> interest would accrue at the rate of 6.75% per annum, payable quarterly, would be added to principal until June 30, 2021, and then be payable in cash thereafter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, we filed an amended and restated certificate of designation with the Secretary of State of Delaware in order to modify the terms of our authorized, but unissued, shares of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock to reflect those contemplated under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement.\nWe also filed a registration statement to register for resale under the Securities Act the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock and exercise of the Exchange Warrants.\nPublic Offering\nOn January 8, 2021, we issued and sold 6,765,463 shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 926,844 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 7,692,307 shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share of $6.50 in the Public Offering. In addition, we granted the underwriter for the Public Offering an option to purchase, for a period of 45 days, up to an additional 1,153,846 shares of our common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an additional 1,153,846 shares of our common stock. On January 8, 2021, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option, in part, for warrants to purchase 754,035 shares of our common stock. On January 12, 2021, we closed the Public Offering. Further, on February 1, 2021, the underwriter again exercised its over-allotment option, in part, to purchase 374,035 shares of our common stock. On February 3, 2021, we closed the underwriter's partial exercise of its over-allotment option.\nThe aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Public Offering, including from the exercises by the underwriter of its over-allotment option, totaled $52.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\nDecember 2020 Exchange Agreement Amendment\nOn January 12, 2021, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, we entered into an Amendment to Senior Secured Convertible Notes and Amendment to Warrant, or the January 2021 Amendment, with Deerfield and Deerfield Special Situations Fund, LP, collectively the Deerfield Holders. The January 2021 Amendment modified certain specified terms of (i) the Facility Notes and (ii) the warrant held be Deerfield, issued on June 2, 2014, or the Deerfield Warrant, to, among other things, exclude the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement and issuance of securities pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement from the anti-dilution provisions of the Facility Notes and the Deerfield Warrant.\nWarrant Exercise Inducement Letters and Issuance of Warrants\nOn January 26, 2021, we entered into warrant exercise inducement offer letters, or the Inducement Letters, with certain holders of warrants issued in the Public Offering, or the Existing Warrants, and collectively, the Exercising Holders, pursuant to which such holders exercised for cash their Existing Warrants to purchase 6,620,358 shares of our common stock in exchange for new warrants, or the Inducement Warrants, on substantially the same terms as the Existing Warrants, except as set forth in the following sentence, to purchase up to 7,944,430 shares of our common stock, which was equal to 120% of the number of shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants. The purchase price of the Inducement Warrants was $0.125 per share underlying each Inducement Warrant, and the Inducement Warrants have an exercise price of $6.36 per share. We received aggregate gross proceeds of $44.0 million from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Exercising Holders and the sale of the Inducement Warrants.\nWe also filed a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of the shares of our common stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of the Inducement Warrants which was declared effective on February 16, 2021.\nPayoff of Facility Agreement Notes and Termination of Facility Agreement\nOn February 8, 2021, we entered into a payoff letter with the Facility Note holders, pursuant to which we agreed to pay off and thereby terminate the Facility Agreement.\nPursuant to the payoff letter, we paid a total of $8.0 million to the Facility Note holders, representing the principal balance, accrued interest outstanding and a prepayment fee in repayment of our outstanding obligations under the Facility Agreement.\nPursuant to the payoff letter, all outstanding indebtedness and obligations of us owing to the Facility Note holders under the Facility Agreement have been paid in full. The Facility Agreement and the notes thereunder, as well as the security interests in the assets of us securing the Facility Agreement and note obligations, have been terminated.\nThird-Party Agreements\nKP415 License Agreement\nIn September 2019, we entered into the KP415 License Agreement with Commave. Under the KP415 License Agreement, we granted to Commave an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates containing SDX and d-MPH, including AZSTARYS, KP484, and, at the option of Commave, KP879, KP922 or any other product candidate developed by us containing SDX and developed to treat ADHD or any other central nervous system disorder, or the Additional Product Candidates and, collectively with AZSTARYS and KP484, the Licensed Product Candidates.\nUnder the terms of the KP415 License Agreement, we granted Commave an exclusive, worldwide license to commercialize and develop the Licensed Product Candidates; provided that such license shall apply to an Additional Product Candidates only if Commave exercises its option under the KP415 License Agreement related thereto. If Commave exercises its option related to any Additional Product Candidate under the KP415 License Agreement, the parties are obligated to negotiate in good faith regarding the economic terms of such Additional Product Candidate. We also granted to Commave a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize any Additional Product Candidate, with such right of first refusal expiring upon the acceptance of a new drug application for such Additional Product Candidate. We also granted Commave a right of first negotiation and a right of first refusal, subject to specified exceptions, for any assignment of our rights under the KP415 License Agreement.\nPursuant to the KP415 License Agreement, Commave paid us an upfront payment of $10.0 million and agreed to pay up to $63.0 million in milestone payments upon the occurrence of specified regulatory milestones related to AZSTARYS, including FDA approval and specified conditions with respect to the final approval label, and KP484. As a result of the FDA's approval of the AZSTARYS NDA, we have earned a regulatory milestone payment following FDA approval as provided under the KP415 License Agreement, and we are working with Commave to evaluate the related provisions and amounts. In addition, Commave agreed to make additional payments upon the achievement of specified U.S. sales milestones of up to $420.0 million in the aggregate, depending, among other things, on timing of approval for AZSTARYS and its final approved label, if any. In May 2020, the FDA accepted our NDA for AZSTARYS. Per the KP415 License Agreement, we received a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA. Further, Commave will pay us quarterly, tiered royalty payments ranging from a percentage in the high single digits to the mid-twenties of Net Sales (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) in the United States and a percentage in the low to mid-single digits of Net Sales in each country outside the United States, in each case subject to specified reductions under certain conditions as described in the KP415 License Agreement. Commave is obligated to make such royalty payments on a product-by-product basis until expiration of the Royalty Term (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) for the applicable product.\nCommave agreed to be responsible for and reimburse us for all of development, commercialization and regulatory expenses for the Licensed Product Candidates, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the KP415 License Agreement.\nThe KP415 License Agreement will continue on a product-by-product basis (i) until expiration of the Royalty Term for the applicable Licensed Product Candidate in the United States and (ii) perpetually for all other countries. Commave may terminate the KP415 License Agreement at its convenience upon prior written notice prior to regulatory approval of any Licensed Product Candidate or upon prior written notice after regulatory approval of any Licensed Product Candidate. We may terminate the KP415 License Agreement in full if Commave, any of its sublicensees or any of its or their affiliates challenge the validity of any Licensed Patent (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) and such challenge is not required under a court order or subpoena and is not a defense against a claim, action or proceeding asserted by us. Either party may terminate the KP415 License Agreement (i) upon a material breach of the KP415 License Agreement by the other party, subject to a cure period, or (ii) if the other party encounters bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon a Serious Material Breach (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) by us, subject to a cure period, Commave may choose not to terminate the KP415 License Agreement and instead reduce the milestone and royalty payments owed to us. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted by us to Commave pursuant to the KP415 License Agreement would revert to us. During the term of the KP415 License Agreement, we may not develop or commercialize any Competing Product (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement).\nThe KP415 License Agreement also established a joint steering committee, which monitors progress of the development of both AZSTARYS and KP484. Subject to the oversight of the joint steering committee, we otherwise retain all responsibility for the conduct of all regulatory activities required to obtain new drug application approval of AZSTARYS and KP484; provided that Commave shall be the sponsor of any clinical trials conducted by us on behalf of Commave.\nAPADAZ License Agreement\nIn October 2018, we entered into the APADAZ License Agreement with KVK pursuant to which we have granted an exclusive license to KVK to conduct regulatory activities for, manufacture and commercialize APADAZ in the United States.\nPursuant to the APADAZ License Agreement, KVK has agreed to pay us certain payments and cost reimbursements of an estimated $3.4 million, which includes a payment of $2.0 million within 10 days of the achievement of a specified milestone related to the initial formulary adoption of APADAZ, or the Initial Adoption Milestone. In addition, KVK has agreed to make additional payments to us upon the achievement of specified sales milestones of up to $53.0 million in the aggregate. Further, we and KVK will share the quarterly net profits of APADAZ by KVK in the United States at specified tiered percentages, ranging from us receiving 30% to 50% of net profits, based on the amount of net sales on a rolling four quarter basis. We are responsible for a portion of commercialization and regulatory expenses for APADAZ until the Initial Adoption Milestone is achieved, after which KVK will be responsible for all expenses incurred in connection with commercialization and maintaining regulatory approval in the United States.\nThe APADAZ License Agreement will terminate on the later of the date that all of the patent rights for APADAZ have expired in the United States or KVK's cessation of commercialization of APADAZ in the United States. KVK may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement upon 90 days written notice if a regulatory authority in the United States orders KVK to stop sales of APADAZ due to a safety concern. In addition, after the third anniversary of the APADAZ License Agreement, KVK may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement without cause upon 18 months prior written notice. We may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement if KVK stops conducting regulatory activities for or commercializing APADAZ in the United States for a period of six months, subject to specified exceptions, or if KVK or its affiliates challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patent under the APADAZ License Agreement. Both parties may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement (i) upon a material breach of the APADAZ License Agreement, subject to a 30-day cure period, (ii) the other party encounters bankruptcy or insolvency or (iii) if the Initial Adoption Milestone is not achieved. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted by us to KVK pursuant to the APADAZ License Agreement would revert to us.\nThe APADAZ License Agreement also established a joint steering committee, which monitors progress of the commercialization of APADAZ.\nOther Third-Party Agreements\nUnder our March 2012 asset purchase agreement with Shire, Shire had a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize AZSTARYS and KP484. In early 2019, Shire was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd, or Takeda, to whom this right of first refusal was transferred at that time. Takeda did not exercise this right of first refusal in connection with our entry into the KP415 License Agreement.\nUnder our March 2012 termination agreement with Aquestive, Aquestive has the right to receive a royalty amount equal to 10% of any value generated by AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879, and any product candidates containing SDX, including royalty payments on any license of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879, the sale of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879 to a third party, the commercialization of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879 and the portion of any consideration that is attributable to the value of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879 and paid to us or our stockholders in a change of control transaction. In connection with the KP415 License Agreement, we paid Aquestive a royalty equal to 10% of the upfront license payment we received in the third quarter of 2019 and the regulatory milestone payment we received in the second quarter of 2020.\nIn July 2020, we entered into the Corium Consulting Agreement under which Corium engaged us to guide the product development and regulatory activities for certain current and potential future products in their portfolio, as well as continue supporting preparation for the potential commercial launch of AZSTARYS. Under the Corium Consulting Agreement, we are entitled to receive payments from Corium of up to $15.6 million, $13.6 million of which will be paid in quarterly installments through March 31, 2022. The remaining $2.0 million is conditioned upon the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone related to Corium's product portfolio. Corium also agreed to be responsible for and reimburse us for all development, commercialization and regulatory expenses incurred as part of the performance of the consulting services.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of AZSTARYS, APADAZ or any of our other product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. We expect that our only source of revenues will be through payments arising from our license agreements with Commave and KVK, and through any other future arrangements related to one of our other product candidates. To date, we have generated revenue from the KP415 License Agreement in the form of the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million, of which we paid Aquestive $1.0 million as a royalty payment, a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA, of which we paid Aquestive $0.5 million as a royalty payment, reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs and payments related to the performance of consulting services. In addition, we have generated revenue under the Corium Consulting Agreement and other consulting arrangements for the performance of consulting services as well as reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party costs associated with those services. We cannot guarantee that either Commave or KVK will be able to successfully commercialize AZSTARYS or our product candidates covered under the KP415 License Agreement, or APADAZ, or that we will ever receive any payments under the KP415 License Agreement from commercial sales of APADAZ or any future payments under the APADAZ License Agreement. We also do not know when, if ever, any other product candidate will be commercially available.\nRoyalties and Contract Costs\nThe components of our royalties and contract costs are royalties and expenses directly attributable to revenue. To date, we have generated revenue from the KP415 License Agreement in the form of the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million, a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA, reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs and payments related to the performance of consulting services. In connection with the KP415 License Agreement, we paid Aquestive a royalty equal to 10% of the upfront license payment we received in the third quarter of 2019 and 10% of the regulatory milestone, related to the acceptance of the NDA, we received in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we capitalized incremental costs directly attributable to the KP415 License Agreement, these costs are amortized to royalties and contract costs as revenue is recognized.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into three categories: research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and severance expense. Salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, comprise a significant component of each of these expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with our facilities, information technology costs and depreciation and amortization between research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses based on employee headcount and the nature of work performed by each employee.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists of expenses incurred while performing research and development activities to discover and develop potential product candidates. This includes conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expense primarily consists of:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits and any stock-based compensation, for our scientific personnel performing research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> costs related to executing preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> fees paid to consultants and other third parties who support our product candidate development;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> other costs in seeking regulatory approval of our products; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> allocated facility-related costs and overhead.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outsourced development costs directly identified to programs:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AZSTARYS\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> KP484\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> APADAZ\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,866 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total outsourced development costs directly identified to programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,721 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development costs not directly identified to programs:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs including cash compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,204 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>599 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,891 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development costs not directly allocated to programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,415 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that our research and development expense will fluctuate for the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to advance the development of our product candidates, subject to the availability of additional funding. In accordance with the KP415 License Agreement, Commave has also agreed to be responsible and reimburse us for all of development, commercialization and regulatory expenses for the Licensed Product Candidates, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the KP415 License Agreement.\nThe successful commercialization of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our other product candidates that may be approved and the development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs required to commercialize AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other product candidates, if approved, and complete the remaining development of any product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the commercialization and development of our products and product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and any stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes personnel in executive, finance, human resources and administrative support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, consulting costs and costs of our information systems.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expense will fluctuate as we continue to operate as a public reporting company and continue to develop our product candidates. We believe that these fluctuations will likely include costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees for outside consultants, lawyers and accountants. We also expect to continue to incur costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations, disclosure and similar requirements applicable to public reporting companies.\nSeverance Expense\nSeverance expense in 2020 consisted of severance payments and stock-based compensation paid to our former chief business officer who ceased to serve in this role in February 2020. We had no severance expense in 2019.\nOther (Expense) Income\nOther (expense) income consists primarily of non-cash costs associated with fair value adjustments to our derivative and warrant liability and amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount to interest expense. Other (expense) income also includes interest expense incurred on our outstanding borrowings, as well as, interest and other income consisting primarily of interest earned on investments. These items are unrelated to our core business and thus are recognized as other (expense) income in our statements of operations.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit consists of refundable state income tax credits. To date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal or state income taxes because we have not generated taxable income. We have received state income tax credits related to our qualified research activities in Iowa.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Period-to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>449 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Royalty and direct contract acquisition costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,640 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,572 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,895 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>828 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,279 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,609 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,337 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,728 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense related to amortization of debt issuance costs and discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,305 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,656 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(649 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on principal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,785 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,858 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value adjustment related to derivative and warrant liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(184 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,182 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(220 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other (expense) income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,185 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,207 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,978 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,794 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,544 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,760 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,522 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,762 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $12.8 million, a decrease of $11.8 million compared to net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $24.5 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in loss from operations of $14.7 million, partially offset by a change in non-cash fair value adjustment from income of $2.0 million in 2019 to expense of $0.2 million in 2020, related to changes to the derivative and warrant liability, and an increase in net interest expense and other items of $0.8 million.\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $0.4 million, from $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting revenue of $5.3 million, primarily related to the Corium Consulting Agreement, and an increase in reimbursement revenue of $0.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in licensing and milestone revenue of $5.0 million, due to the one-time non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million received in 2019 compared to, the $5.0 million payment received related to the regulatory milestone in 2020 both pursuant to the KP415 License Agreement.\nRoyalties and Contract Costs\nRoyalties and contract costs decreased by $1.6 million, from $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in royalties due to Aquestive of $0.5 million related to the upfront and milestone payments we received in 2019 and 2020 discussed above and a decrease in the amortization of capitalized contract costs which were directly attributable to the revenue recognized of $1.1 million.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $10.6 million, from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net third-party research and development costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $2.9 million, from $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional fees and personnel-related costs.\nSeverance Expense\nSeverance expense of $0.8 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the termination of our chief business officer in February 2020. Severance expense is comprised of $0.4 million of personnel and other related charges and $0.4 million of stock compensation expense related to the acceleration of vesting on certain stock options upon employee termination. We had no severance expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther (Expense) Income\nOther expenses increased by $3.0 million, from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This period-to-period increase in expense was primarily attributable to a change in non-cash fair value adjustment from income of $2.0 million in 2019 to expense of $0.2 million in 2020 related to our derivative and warrant liability and an increase in net interest expense and other items of $0.8 million.\nComparison for Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nFor a discussion and analysis of changes in financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nThrough December 31, 2020, we have funded our research and development and operating activities primarily through the issuance of debt, private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial public offering, at-the-market offering, underwritten public offerings, through our purchase agreements with Lincoln Park Capital LLC, or Lincoln Park, and from revenue received under the KP415 License Agreement, the Corium Consulting Agreement and other consulting arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 million and restricted cash of $0.1 million.\nIn February 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement for an equity line of credit, or the 2019 ELOC Agreement, with Lincoln Park, which provided that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, we may sell to Lincoln Park up to $15.0 million of shares of our common stock, from time to time over the 36-month term of the 2019 ELOC Agreement, and upon execution of the 2019 ELOC Agreement we issued an additional 7,512 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares in accordance with the closing conditions contained within the 2019 ELOC Agreement. In February 2020, upon entering into a new purchase agreement for an equity line of credit, or the 2020 ELOC Agreement, with Lincoln Park, we terminated the 2019 ELOC Agreement. As a result, we will not make any future sales under the 2019 ELOC Agreement. Through the date of termination, we sold 212,579 shares of our common stock (exclusive of the 7,512 commitment shares) to Lincoln Park under the 2019 ELOC Agreement for approximately $5.4 million in gross proceeds.\nIn September 2019, we entered into the KP415 License Agreement with Commave and Commave paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million. In May 2020, the FDA accepted our NDA for AZSTARYS. Per the KP415 License Agreement, we received a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA. In July 2020, we entered into the Corium Consulting Agreement under which Corium engaged us to guide the product development and regulatory activities for certain current and potential future products in their portfolio, as well as continue supporting preparation for the potential commercial launch of AZSTARYS. Under the Corium Consulting Agreement, we are entitled to receive payments from Corium of up to $15.6 million, $13.6 million of which will be paid in quarterly installments through March 31, 2022. The remaining $2.0 million is conditioned upon the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone related to Corium's product portfolio. Corium also agreed to be responsible for and reimburse us for all development, commercialization and regulatory expenses incurred as part of the performance of the consulting services.\nIn February 2020, we entered into the 2020 ELOC Agreement, with Lincoln Park, which provided that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, we may sell to Lincoln Park up to $4.0 million of shares of our common stock, from time to time over the 12-month term of the 2020 ELOC Agreement, and upon execution of the 2020 ELOC Agreement we issued an additional 19,289 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares in accordance with the closing conditions contained within the 2020 ELOC Agreement. In May 2020, we reached the maximum allowable shares to be issued under the Current Registration Statement of 579,260 shares and therefore we cannot issue additional shares under the 2020 ELOC Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we have sold 559,971 shares of common stock (exclusive of the 19,289 commitment shares previously issued to Lincoln Park) under the 2020 ELOC Agreement for approximately $2.3 million in gross proceeds.\nWe have had recurring negative operating cash flows and, as of December 31, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $258.5 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur minimal positive net cash flows from operations or negative net cash flows from operations for at least the next several years. We expect that our sources of revenue will be through payments arising from our license agreements with Commave and KVK, or through our Corium Consulting Agreement, and other potential consulting arrangements and any other future arrangements related to one of our other product candidates.\nIn January 2021, we completed the Public Offering. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Public Offering, including from the exercises by the underwriter of its over-allotment option, totaled $52.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\nIn January 2021, we entered into the Inducement Letters. We received aggregate gross proceeds of $44.0 million from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Exercising Holders and the sale of the Inducement Warrants.\nOn April 23, 2020, we received proceeds of $0.8 million from a loan, or the PPP Loan, under the Paycheck Protection Program, or the PPP, of the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, a portion of which may be forgiven, which we used to retain current employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments. The PPP Loan matures on April 23, 2022 and bears annual interest at a rate of 1.0%. Payments of principal and interest on the PPP Loan are deferred for the first 16 months of the PPP Loan term. Thereafter, we could be required to pay the lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest.\nThe CARES Act and the PPP provide a mechanism for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed. Under the PPP, we may apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or part of the PPP Loan. The amount of loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness was originally based on a formula that takes into account a number of factors, including the amount of loan proceeds used by us during the 24-week period after the loan origination for certain purposes, including payroll costs, interest on certain mortgage obligations, rent payments on certain leases, and certain qualified utility payments, provided that at least 60% of the loan amount was used for eligible payroll costs. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on loan forgiveness, only loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered 24-week period qualify for forgiveness. We have applied for forgiveness under the provisions of the PPP loan and are awaiting a decision by the SBA.\nConvertible Debt\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $68.2 million of convertible notes outstanding, consisting of senior secured convertible promissory notes issued, under the Deerfield Facility Agreement with Deerfield. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we repaid in full the convertible notes and terminated the Deerfield Facility Agreement.\nDeerfield Facility Agreement\nIn June 2014, we entered into the Deerfield Facility Agreement as a $60.0 million multi-tranche credit facility with Deerfield. At the time we entered into the Deerfield Facility Agreement, we borrowed the first tranche, which consisted of a $15.0 million term note and the $10.0 million convertible note, or the Deerfield Convertible Note.\nThe Deerfield Convertible Note originally bore interest at 9.75% per annum, but was subsequently reduced to 6.75%. Interest accrued on the outstanding balance under the Deerfield Convertible Note was due quarterly in arrears. We originally had to repay one-third of the outstanding principal amount of the Deerfield Convertible Note on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Deerfield Facility Agreement (June 2018 and June 2019). In June 2018, Deerfield agreed to convert the $3,333,333 of the principal amount then due, plus $168,288 of accrued interest, into 37,410 shares of our common stock. In September 2019, we entered into an amendment with Deerfield in order to (i) reduce the interest rate applicable under the Deerfield Facility Agreement from 9.75% to 6.75%, (ii) provide for payment in kind\u201d of interest on the Loans (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement), and (iii) defer the Loan payments due pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement until June 1, 2020. In December 2019, we entered into another amendment with Deerfield in order to (i) defer the Loan payments due pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement until March 31, 2021 and (ii) allow for the entries of additional debt and debt holders under the Deerfield Facility Agreement (as discussed in more detail below).\nPursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement, we issued to Deerfield 1,923,077 shares of our Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, or Series D Preferred, as consideration for the loans provided to us thereunder. Upon closing of our initial public offering, these shares of Series D Preferred reclassified into 16,025 shares of our common stock.\nWe also issued to Deerfield the Deerfield Warrant to purchase 14,423,076 shares of our Series D Preferred at an initial exercise price of $0.78 per share, or the Deerfield Warrant. Upon closing of our initial public offering, this warrant converted into a warrant exercisable for 120,192 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $93.60 per share.\n2021 Notes\nIn February 2016, we issued our 5.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2021, or the 2021 Notes, in aggregate principal amount of $86.3 million. The 2021 Notes were originally issued to Cowen and Company and RBCCM LLC as representatives of the several initial purchasers, who subsequently resold the 2021 Notes to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act.\nThe 2021 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of February 9, 2016, or the indenture, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Interest on the 2021 Notes was payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2016, at a rate of 5.50% per year. The 2021 Notes originally matured on February 1, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased.\nAs described in more detail below, in multiple exchanges occurring in October 2018, December 2019 and January 2020, all outstanding 2021 Notes were exchanged by the holders thereof for either shares of our common stock or the December 2019 Notes and January 2020 Note issued under the terms of the Deerfield Facility Agreement.\n2021 Note Exchanges\n2021 Note Exchange Effected in October 2018\nIn October 2018, we entered into an exchange agreement, or the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, with the Deerfield Lenders. Under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, the Deerfield Lenders exchanged an aggregate of $9,577,000 principal amount of our 2021 Notes for an aggregate of 9,577 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001, or the Series A Preferred Stock.\nAs a condition to closing of the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, we filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series A Certificate of Designation, with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of our common stock at a price equal to $48.00 per share (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events). Immediately following the exchange under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, an aggregate of 3,192,333 shares of common stock were issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2020, all 9,577 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement have been converted into an aggregate 199,519 shares of our common stock.\n2021 Note Exchange Effected in September 2019\nIn September 2019, we entered into an Exchange Agreement and Amendment to Facility Agreement, or the September 2019 Exchange Agreement with the Deerfield Lenders. Under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 493,742 shares of our common stock and an aggregate of 1,576 shares of our Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, or the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, (such shares of common stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Initial Exchange Shares), in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $3,000,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes. The September 2019 Exchange Agreement provided the Deerfield Lenders the option to exchange up to an additional aggregate of $27,000,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, or the Optional Exchange Principal Amount, for shares of common stock or shares of our Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, or the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, and, together with the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, including limits as to the principal amount that can be exchanged prior to specified dates therein. If the Deerfield Lenders choose to exchange any portion of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount for shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock, such exchange will be effected at an exchange price of $1,000 per share. If the Deerfield Lenders choose to exchange any portion of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount for shares of common stock, such exchange will be effected at an exchange price equal to the greater of (i) $15.1904 or (ii) the average of the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange.\nAs a condition to closing of the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, we filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series B-1 Certificate of Designation, and a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation, with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively.\nEach share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a per share price equal to $15.1904 per share (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events). There was an aggregate of 103,749 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described below). Each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a per share price equal to the greater of (i) $15.1904 (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events), or (ii) the average of the volume-weighted average prices of the common stock on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange. Immediately following the exchange under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, there was an aggregate of 1,777,437 shares of Common Stock issuable (i) in exchange of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount, or (ii) upon conversion of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock issuable in exchange of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount (in each case without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described below).\nThe Series B Preferred Stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Deerfield Lenders; provided that the Deerfield Lenders are prohibited from converting shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of common stock if, as a result of such conversion, such holders (together with certain affiliates and group\u201d members of such holders) would beneficially own more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding. The Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemable. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Deerfield Lenders will receive an amount equal to $0.0001 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends, and thereafter will share ratably in any distribution of our assets with holders of common stock and with the holders of any shares of any other class or series of capital stock of us entitled to share in such remaining assets of us (including our Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. With respect to rights upon liquidation, the Series B Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock, on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, if any is outstanding, and junior to existing and future indebtedness. Except as otherwise required by law (or with respect to approval of certain actions involving our organizational documents that materially and adversely affect the holders of Series B Preferred Stock), the Series B Preferred Stock does not have voting rights. The Series B Preferred Stock is not subject to any price-based anti-dilution protections and does not provide for any accruing dividends, but provides that holders of Series B Preferred Stock will participate in any dividends on the common stock on an as-converted basis (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described above). The Series B-1 Certificate of Designation and the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation also provide for partial liquidated damages in the event that we fail to timely convert shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock or Series B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively, into common stock in accordance with the applicable Certificate of Designation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, all 1,576 shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock have been converted into 103,749 shares of common stock, and there were no shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock outstanding.\n2021 Note Exchange Effected in December 2019\nIn December 2019, we entered into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement and Amendment to Facility Agreement, Senior Secured Convertible Notes and Warrants, or the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, with the Deerfield Lenders and Delaware Street Capital Master Fund, L.P., or DSC and, collectively with the Deerfield Lenders, the December 2019 Holders. Under the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, we issued the December 2019 Notes as senior secured convertible promissory notes under the Deerfield Facility Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $71,418,011 in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $71,418,011 principal amount and accrued interest of the 2021 Notes. Upon entering into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, we agreed to pay the December 2019 Holders, in the aggregate, an interest payment of $745,011, which represents 50% of the accrued interest, as of December 18, 2019, on the 2021 Notes owned by the December 2019 Holders. The remainder of such interest was included in the principal amount of the December 2019 Notes.\nThe December 2019 Notes bear interest at 6.75% per annum. The December 2019 Notes were originally convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $17.11 per share (which represents the conversion price of the 2021 Notes), subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the December 2019 Notes. As of the date of issuance, the December 2019 Notes were convertible, by their terms, into an aggregate of 260,876 shares of our common stock. We subsequently amended the December 2019 Notes to provide that such notes shall be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $93.60 per share (which represents the conversion price of the Deerfield Convertible Note). The conversion price of the December 2019 Notes will be adjusted downward if we issue or sell any shares of common stock, convertible securities, warrants or options at a sale or exercise price per share less than the greater of the December 2019 Notes' conversion price or the closing sale price of our common stock on the last trading date immediately prior to such issuance, or, in the case of a firm commitment underwritten offering, on the date of execution of the underwriting agreement between us and the underwriters for such offering. However, if we effect an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, of our common stock, the conversion price of the December 2019 Notes will be adjusted downward pursuant to this anti-dilution adjustment only if such sales are made at a price less than $93.60 per share, provided that this anti-dilution adjustment will not apply to certain specified sales. Notwithstanding anything in the contrary in the December 2019 Notes, the anti-dilution adjustment of such notes shall not result in the conversion price of the December 2019 Notes being less than $0.583 per share. The December 2019 Notes are convertible at any time at the option of the holders thereof, provided that a holder of a December 2019 Note is prohibited from converting such note into shares of our common stock if, as a result of such conversion, such holder (together with certain affiliates and group\u201d members) would beneficially own more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding. However, the December 2019 Note issued to DSC, due to the fact DSC was a beneficial owner of more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding, has a beneficial ownership cap equal to 19.985% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding. Pursuant to the December 2019 Notes, the December 2019 Holders have the option to demand repayment of all outstanding principal, and any unpaid interest accrued thereon, in connection with a Major Transaction (as defined in the December 2019 Notes), which shall include, among others, any acquisition or other change of control of the company; our liquidation, bankruptcy or other dissolution; or if at any time after March 31, 2021, shares of our common stock are not listed on an Eligible Market (as defined in the December 2019 Notes). The December 2019 Notes are subject to specified events of default, the occurrence of which would entitle the December 2019 Holders to immediately demand repayment of all outstanding principal and accrued interest on the December 2019 Notes. Such events of default include, among others, failure to make any payment under the December 2019 Notes when due, failure to observe or perform any covenant under the Deerfield Facility Agreement or the other transaction documents related thereto (subject to a standard cure period), our failure to be able to pay debts as they come due, the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against us, a material judgement levied against us and a material default by us under the Deerfield Warrant, the December 2019 Notes or the Deerfield Convertible Note.\nThe December 2019 Exchange Agreement amends the Deerfield Facility Agreement, in order to, among other things, (i) provide for the Deerfield Facility Agreement to govern the December 2019 Notes received by the December 2019 Holders pursuant to the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, (ii) extend the maturity of the Deerfield Convertible Note from February 14, 2020 and June 1, 2020, as applicable, to March 31, 2021, (iii) defer interest payments on the Deerfield Convertible Note and December 2019 Notes until March 31, 2021 (which such interest shall accrue as \u201dpayment-in-kind\u201d interest), (iv) designate DSC as a Lender (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement), (v) name Deerfield as the Collateral Agent\u201d for all Lenders and (vi) modify the terms and conditions under which we may issue additional pari passu and subordinated indebtedness under the Deerfield Facility Agreement (subject to certain conditions specified in the Deerfield Facility Agreement).\nThe December 2019 Exchange Agreement also amends and restates that the Deerfield Convertible Note to conform the definitions of Eligible Market\u201d and Major Transactions\u201d to the definition in the December 2019 Notes, to remove provisions that were only applicable prior to our initial public offering and to make certain other changes to conform to the December 2019 Notes. The conversion price for the Deerfield Convertible Note remains $93.60 per share, subject to adjustment on the same basis as the December 2019 Notes.\nThe December 2019 Exchange Agreement also amends Deerfield Warrant to conform the definitions of Eligible Market\u201d and Major Transaction\u201d in the Warrant with the definitions of such terms in the December 2019 Notes.\nIn connection with entering into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, we also amended and restated the Guaranty and Security Agreement, dated June 2, 2014, by and between us and the other parties thereto, or the GSA, to, among other things, (i) provide that all of the notes will be secured by the liens securing the indebtedness under the Deerfield Facility Agreement, and (ii) name Deerfield as the Collateral Agent\u201d under the GSA.\nIn connection with entering into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, we also entered into an amendment, or the September 2019 Exchange Agreement Amendment, to the September 2019 Exchange Agreement to, among other things, (i) amend and restate Annex I of the September 2019 Exchange Agreement to allow the Deerfield Lenders to effect optional exchanges of the December 2019 Notes and the Deerfield Convertible Note under the terms of the September 2019 Exchange Agreement; (ii) amend the common stock exchange price under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement to be a per share price equal to the greater of (x) $9.60, subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events, or (y) the average of the volume-weighted average prices of our common stock on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange, (iii) provide that no more than 1,777,437 shares of our common stock shall be issued pursuant to optional exchanges under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement (whether by common stock exchange or upon conversion of Series B-2 Shares (as defined in the September 2019 Exchange Agreement Amendment)), subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events and (iv) eliminate limitations regarding the timing and aggregate amount of principal which may be exchanged under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement.\nIn connection with entering into the September 2019 Exchange Agreement Amendment, we filed an amendment to the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation Amendment, with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware. The Series B-2 Certificate of Designation Amendment provides that each share of the Series B-Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of our common stock at a per share price equal to the common stock exchange price under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, which equals the greater of (i) $9.60 (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events), or (ii) the average of the volume-weighted average prices of our common stock on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Deerfield Lenders have converted $17.1 million of principal on the December 2019 Notes into all 1,777,437 shares of common stock issuable under the Deerfield Optional Conversion Feature.\n2021 Note Exchange Effected in January 2020\nIn January 2020, we entered into a January 2020 Exchange Agreement, or the January 2020 Exchange Agreement, with M. Kingdon Offshore Master Fund, LP, or Kingdon. Under the January 2020 Exchange Agreement, we issued the January 2020 Note as a senior secured convertible note in the aggregate principal amount of $3,037,354 in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $3,037,354 principal amount and accrued interest of the 2021 Note then owned by Kingdon. Upon entering into the January 2020 Exchange Agreement, we agreed to pay Kingdon an interest payment of $37,354, which represents 50% of the accrued and unpaid interest, as of January 13, 2020, on Kingdon's 2021 Note. The remainder of such interest was included in the principal amount of the January 2020 Note.\nThe January 2020 Note was issued with substantially the same terms and conditions as the December 2019 Notes (as amended by the amendment described in more detail below).\nIn connection with entering into the January 2020 Exchange Agreement, we entered into an Amendment to Facility Agreement and December 2019 Notes and Consent, or the December 2019 Note Amendment, with the December 2019 Holders that, among other things, (i) amended the December 2019 Notes to (a) reduce the Conversion Price (as defined in the December 2019 Notes) from $273.76 to $93.60 per share, (b) increased the Floor Price (as defined in the December 2019 Notes) from $6.08 to $9.328 per share, and (ii) amended Deerfield Facility Agreement to (x) provide for Kingdon to join the Deerfield Facility Agreement as a Lender (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement) and (y) provide that the 2020 Note and shall constitute a Senior Secured Convertible Note\u201d (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement) for purposes of the Deerfield Facility Agreement and other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement). As a result of the December 2019 Note Amendment, the December 2019 Notes were convertible, by their terms, into an aggregate of 11,753,016 shares of our common stock, assuming a conversion date of January 13, 2020.\nDebt Restructuring\nIn December 2020, we entered into the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, which was amended on December 24, 2020. Pursuant to the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, and (a) we made the Debt Payment as a cash pre-payment of a portion of principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and the Deerfield Note to the Deerfield Lenders, DSC and Kingdon, or, collectively, the Holders, in an aggregate amount equal to approximately $30.3 million,; and (b) issued 31,476.98412 shares of our Series B-2 Preferred Stock and warrants exercisable for 3,632,019 shares of our common stock, or the Exchange Warrants, in exchange for the cancellation of a portion of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and Deerfield Note owned by the Holders, with such transaction referred to as the Exchange. Immediately following the completion of the Exchange and Debt Payment, the aggregate balance of principal and accrued interest remaining outstanding under the Facility Notes was approximately $7.6 million.\nThe December 2020 Exchange Agreement amended the Senior Secured Notes to provide that the failure of our common stock to remain listed on an eligible securities market will not constitute a Major Transaction\u201d unless such failure occurs after March 31, 2023.\nThe December 2020 Exchange Agreement amended the Deerfield Facility Agreement in order to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date of the Senior Secured Notes and the Deerfield Note to March 31, 2023, (ii) provide for cash payments of interest on the Loans (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement) for the periods following July 1, 2021, and (iii) provide for specified prepayment terms on the Loans.\nThe December 2020 Exchange Agreement amended that certain Amended and Restated Investors' Rights Agreement, dated as of February 19, 2015, or the IRA, by and among us, Deerfield and the other parties signatory thereto in order to, among other things, add Deerfield Special Situations Fund, L.P. as a party thereto and to give effect to the issuance of the Exchange Warrants and our registration obligations under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement (as described in more detail below).\nThe Exercise Warrants are subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as the Existing Warrants, with an exercise price equal to the exercise price per share of the Existing Warrants and will provide that the Holders will be limited from exercising such Exchange Warrants if, as a result of such exercise, such holders (together with certain affiliates and group\u201d members of such holders) would beneficially own more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding.\nPursuant to the terms of the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, we also filed a registration statement to register for resale under the Securities Act the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock and exercise of the Exchange Warrants.\nIn connection with the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Amended and Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation, with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock.\nThe shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock are convertible into an aggregate of 4,842,690 shares of our common stock. Each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will have an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and will be convertible into shares of our common stock at a per share price equal to $6.4999 (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events).\nThe Series B-2 Preferred Stock will be convertible at any time on or after the PDUFA Date (as defined in the Amended and Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation) at the option of the holders thereof; provided that the holders thereof will be prohibited from converting shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock into shares our common stock if, as a result of such conversion, such holders (together with certain affiliates and group\u201d members of such holders) would beneficially own more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding. The Series B-2 Preferred Stock will not be redeemable. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up or our change in control, the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will receive, prior to any distribution or payment on our common stock, an amount equal to the greater of (i) $1,000 per share (in the case of a change in control, transaction consideration with such value), or (ii) the amount (in the case of a change in control, in the form of the transaction consideration) per share each such holder would have been entitled to receive if every share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock immediately prior to such event, in each case, plus any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. With respect to rights upon liquidation, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock will rank senior to our common stock, on parity with any Parity Securities (as defined in the Amended and Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation) and junior to any Senior Securities (as defined in the Amended and Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation) and existing and future indebtedness. Except as otherwise required by law (or with respect to approval of certain actions involving our organizational documents that adversely affect the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock and other specified matters regarding the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock), the Series B-2 Preferred Stock will not have voting rights. The Series B-2 Preferred Stock will not be subject to any price-based anti-dilution protections and will not provide for any accruing dividends, but will provide that holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will participate in any dividends on our common stock on an as-converted basis (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described above). The Amended and Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation also provides for partial liquidated damages in the event that we fail to timely convert shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock into common stock in accordance with the Amended and Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation.\nDecember 2020 Exchange Agreement Amendment\nOn January 12, 2021, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, we entered into an Amendment to Senior Secured Convertible Notes and Amendment to Warrant, or the January 2021 Amendment, with the Deerfield Holders. The January 2021 Amendment modifies certain specified terms of (i) the Facility Notes and (ii) the Deerfield Warrant to, among other things, exclude the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement and issuance of securities pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement from the anti-dilution provisions of the Facility Notes and the Deerfield Warrant.\nSeries B-2 Preferred Stock\nOn January 11, 2021, as a condition to closing of the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation, with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock.\nPayoff of Facility Agreement Notes and Termination of Facility Agreement\nOn February 8, 2021, we entered into a payoff letter with the Facility Agreement Note Holders, pursuant to which we agreed to pay off and thereby terminate the Facility Agreement.\nPursuant to the payoff letter, we paid a total of $8.0 million to the Facility Agreement Note Holders, representing the principal balance, accrued interest outstanding and a prepayment fee in repayment of our outstanding obligations under the Facility Agreement.\nPursuant to the payoff letter, all outstanding indebtedness and obligations of us owing to the Facility Agreement Note Holders under the Facility Agreement have been paid in full. The Facility Agreement and the notes thereunder, as well as the security interests in the assets of us securing the Facility Agreement and note obligations, have been terminated. The Facility Agreement Note Holders will retain the warrants previously issued to them.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Period-to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,939 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(23,737 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,798 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,267 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,200 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,564 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,331 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities of $1.9 million consisted of a net loss of $12.8 million, partially offset by $0.4 million in changes in working capital and $10.4 million in adjustments for non-cash items. Net loss was primarily attributable to our spending on research and development programs and operating costs, partially offset by revenue received under the KP415 License Agreement and the Corium Consulting Agreement. The changes in working capital consisted of $0.9 million related to a change in accounts payable and accrued expenses, $0.2 million related to a change in prepaid expenses and other assets and $0.3 million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and other liabilities, partially offset by $0.7 million related to a change in accounts and other receivables and $0.3 million related to operating lease liabilities. The adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $2.5 million, non-cash interest expense of $4.7 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $2.3 million, loss on sublease and disposal of property and equipment of $0.3 million, a change in the fair value adjustment related to derivative and warrant liabilities of $0.2 million and $0.4 million related to depreciation, amortization and other items.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities of $23.7 million consisted of a net loss of $24.5 million, primarily attributable to our spending on research and development programs, partially offset by revenue received under the KP415 License Agreement, and $5.1 million in changes in working capital; partially offset by $5.9 million in adjustments for non-cash items. The adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $4.4 million, non-cash interest expense of $1.4 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $1.7 million and $0.4 million related to depreciation, amortization and other items; partially offset by non-cash income related to the change in the fair value of our derivative and warrant liabilities of $2.0 million. The changes in working capital consisted of $1.7 million related to a change in accounts and other receivables, $3.8 million related to a change in accounts payable and accrued expenses, $1.5 million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $0.8 million related to a change in other liabilities; partially offset by $0.5 million related to a change in prepaid expenses and other assets and $2.2 million related to operating lease liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $33,000, which was attributable to purchases of property and equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by investing activities was $3.2 million, which was primarily attributable to maturities of marketable securities of $3.3 million, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of $0.1 million.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $2.7 million, which was primarily attributable to proceeds from sales of our common stock under the 2020 ELOC of $2.3 million and proceeds from the PPP loan of $0.8 million, partially offset by repayment of principal on finance lease liabilities of $0.2 million and payment of debt issuance and deferred offerings costs of $0.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $4.9 million, which was primarily attributable to proceeds from sales of our common stock under the 2019 ELOC of $5.4 million; partially offset by repayment of principal on finance lease liabilities of $0.2 million and payment of debt issuance costs of $0.3 million.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nBased on our current operating forecast, we believe that the proceeds from the Public Offering and inducement warrant transactions, together with our existing cash resources and after giving effect to the Deerfield Debt Payment and the Exchange, will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through Q1 2024. This estimate does not include our projected revenue, a portion of which is based royalties from commercial sales and upon the achievement of milestones in the KP415 License Agreement and the APADAZ License Agreement. Certain of the milestones are associated with regulatory matters that are outside our control.\nPotential near-term sources of additional funding include:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> any revenues generated under either the KP415 License Agreement or the APADAZ License Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> any consulting services revenue or short-term milestone payments generated under the KP415 License Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> any consulting services revenue or short-term milestone payments generated under the Corium Consulting Agreement; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> any consulting services revenue generated under other potential consulting arrangements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient proceeds from any of these potential sources to fund our operating expenses.\nTo date, we have generated revenue from the non-refundable upfront payment, regulatory milestone payment, reimbursements of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs and consulting services under the KP415 License Agreement, consulting services, and associated out-of-pocket third-party costs, under the Corium Consulting Agreement and consulting services under other consulting arrangements. We expect that our only sources of revenues will be through payments arising from the KP415 License Agreement, the APADAZ License Agreement, the Corium Consulting Agreement, or through other potential consulting arrangements and any other future arrangements related to one of our product candidates. While we have entered into the APADAZ License Agreement to commercialize APADAZ in the United States, and entered into the KP415 License Agreement to develop, manufacture and commercialize AZSTARYS and KP484, we cannot guarantee that this, or any strategy we adopt in the future, will be successful. For instance, we received a milestone payment of $5.0 million under the KP415 License Agreement due to the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA, and we have earned a regulatory milestone payment for the approval of the AZSTARYS NDA, but we cannot guarantee that we will earn any additional milestone or royalty payments under this agreement in the future. We also expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. If we are unable to generate revenue in the short term under our license agreements, we will need substantial additional funding in order to continue our operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a novel strain of Coronavirus, a global pandemic. This outbreak is causing major disruptions to businesses and markets worldwide as the virus spreads. We cannot predict what the long-term effects of this pandemic and the resulting economic disruptions may have on our liquidity and results of operations. The extent of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity and results of operations will depend on a number future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, and governmental, regulatory and private sector responses, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. The COVID-19 pandemic may make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in any future clinical trials or cause delays in the regulatory approval of our product candidates, including causing potential delay of the FDA's review of our AZSTARYS NDA. A portion of our projected revenue is based upon the achievement of milestones in the KP415 License Agreement associated with regulatory matters that may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we cannot predict what, if any, impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our ability to achieve these milestones. The economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic may also dramatically reduce our ability to secure debt or equity financing necessary to support our operations. We are unable to currently estimate the financial effect of the pandemic. If the pandemic continues to be a severe worldwide crisis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe have based our estimates of our cash needs and cash runway on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient proceeds from the KP415 License Agreement, the APADAZ License Agreement, the Corium Consulting Agreement, and other potential consulting arrangements or other funding transactions to fund our operating expenses. To meet any additional cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders, issue additional debt or seek other third-party funding, including potential strategic transactions, such as licensing or collaboration arrangements. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of product candidates and products, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the commercialization and development of our partnered product or product candidates, should they obtain regulatory approval.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgements and Estimates\nThis management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgements on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note B to our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nAccrued Expenses\nWe enter into contractual agreements with third-party vendors who provide research and development, manufacturing, and other services in the ordinary course of business. Some of these contracts are subject to milestone-based invoicing and services are completed over an extended period of time. We record liabilities under these contractual commitments when an obligation has been incurred. This accrual process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> fees paid to CROs in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of our raw materials, drug substance and product candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> professional fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of these costs, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe record the fair value of stock options issued as of the grant date as compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is equal to the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense has been reported in our statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,459 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,951 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total stock-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,410 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Stock-Based Compensation Grants\nWe calculate the fair value of stock-based compensation arrangements using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of our common stock, the assumed dividend yield, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. In applying these assumptions, we considered the following factors:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> historically we have not had sufficient experience to estimate the volatility of our common stock. As such, we calculated the expected volatility based on reported data for selected similar publicly traded companies for which the historical information is available, or peer volatility, and blended it with our historical volatility, or leverage-adjusted peer volatility. For the purpose of identifying peer companies, we consider characteristics such as industry, length of trading history, similar vesting terms and in-the-money option status. We utilized this leverage-adjusted peer volatility for grants prior to the initial public offering, as well as grants within the two-year period immediately following the initial public offering. For grants after the second anniversary of the initial public offering we utilized our historical volatility to determine the expected volatility;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> the assumed dividend yield is based on our expectation of not paying dividends for the foreseeable future;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> we determine the average expected life of plain vanilla\u201d stock options based on the simplified method in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 107 and 110, as our common stock to date has been publicly traded for a limited amount of time. We expect to use the simplified method until we have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. For options that are not considered plain vanilla,\u201d such as those with exercise prices in excess of the fair market value of the underlying stock, we use an expected life equal to the contractual term of the option;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> we determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to implied yields available from U.S. Treasury securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> we estimate forfeitures based on our historical analysis of actual stock option forfeitures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe account for stock-based compensation arrangements with directors and consultants that contain only service conditions for vesting using a fair value approach. The grant date fair value of these options is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model reflecting the same assumptions as applied to employee options in each of the reported periods, other than the expected life, which is assumed to be the remaining contractual life of the option.\nThe following summarizes the assumptions used for estimating the fair value of stock options granted to employees for the periods indicated:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.38% - 1.65%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1.75% - 2.61%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5.50 - 10.00\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5.50 - 10.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 89.49% - 93.07%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 84.82% - 85.93%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe have a common stock warrant issued to Deerfield, put options embedded within those Deerfield warrants, and common stock warrants issued to KVK that meet the definition of derivative financial instruments and are accounted for as derivatives. The fair value of the common stock warrant issued to Deerfield, and put options embedded within the Deerfield Warrants are based on Monte Carlo simulations, while the common stock warrant issued to KVK is valued using a probability-weighted Black-Scholes option pricing model. These derivatives are fair valued at each reporting period.\nThe derivative liability for the Deerfield common stock warrant was $230,000 and $77,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The derivative liability for the put options embedded within the Deerfield common stock warrant was $25,000 and $19,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The derivative liability for the KVK common stock warrant was $49,000 and $24,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 10% increase in the enterprise value would result in an increase of $29,000 in the estimated fair value of the Deerfield common stock warrant, an increase of $8,000 in the estimated fair value of the put options embedded within the Deerfield common stock warrant and an increase of $8,000 in the estimated fair value of the KVK common stock warrant at December 31, 2020. Upon exercise of the warrants, we will adjust the associated derivative liability to fair value with any changes recorded in other (expense) income. At such time, such derivative liability will also be reclassified to additional paid-in capital, and no further revaluations will be necessary.\nUtilization of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards and Research and Development Credits\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $226.0 million, due to prior period losses, $138.1 million of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2027 and $87.8 million with no expiration. We also had research and development credit carryforwards of $3.8 million with expiration dates ranging from 2027 to 2037 and $2.6 million with no expiration.\nIn accordance with Section 382 of the Code, a change in equity ownership of greater than 50% within a three-year period results in an annual limitation on a company's ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards created during the tax periods prior to the change in ownership. We performed a Section 382 ownership change analysis in 2017 and determined that we experienced an ownership change in 2010, which resulted in a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards being subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 through 2012. No other ownership changes or limitations on our historical net operating loss carryforwards were noted through the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including as a result of the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt or as a result of future changes in our stock ownership. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical net operating loss carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by increasing our future tax obligations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2012, President Obama signed the JOBS Act into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company. As an emerging growth company, we could have elected to adopt new or revised accounting standards when they become effective for non-public companies, which typically is later than public companies must adopt the standards. We have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act and, as a result, will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)-Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This update applies to all entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)-Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d), which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on the concepts in the FASB Concepts Statement, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting-Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements, which the FASB finalized on August 28, 2018, including the consideration of costs and benefits. This update applies to all entities that are required, under existing GAAP, to make disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40); Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity ( ASU 2020-06\u201d), which addresses issues identified as a result of the complexities associated with applying U.S. GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. This update addresses, among other things, the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, targeted improvements to the disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings-per-share ( EPS\u201d) guidance and amendments to the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity, as well as the related EPS guidance. This update applies to all entities that issue convertible instruments and/or contracts in an entity's own equity. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. FASB specified that an entity should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2020-06 could have on our financial statements and disclosures.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- In February 2016, we issued

OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs to treat serious medical conditions through our proprietary LAT technology. We utilize our proprietary LAT technology to generate improved prodrug versions of drugs approved by the FDA as well as to generate prodrug versions of existing compounds that may have applications for new disease indications. Our product candidate pipeline is focused on the high need areas of ADHD, SUD and IH. Our co-lead clinical development candidates, AZSTARYS (formerly referred to as KP415) and KP484, are both based on a prodrug of d-MPH but with differing ER effect profiles, and are intended for the treatment of ADHD. Our clinical product candidate for the treatment of SUD is KP879, based on a prodrug of d-MPH. Our preclinical prodrug product candidate for the treatment of IH is KP1077. We have entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Commave for the development, manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates containing SDX and d-MPH. In addition, we have announced our commercial partnership with KVK of APADAZ, an FDA approved IR combination product of benzhydrocodone, our prodrug of hydrocodone, and APAP for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.\nWe expect that our sources of revenues will be through payments arising from our license agreements with Commave and KVK, our consulting agreement with Corium and through other consulting arrangements and any other future arrangements we might enter into related to one of our other product candidates. To date, we have generated revenue from the KP415 License Agreement in the form of the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million, of which we paid Aquestive $1.0 million as a royalty payment, a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA, of which we paid Aquestive $0.5 million as a royalty payment, reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs and payments related to the performance of consulting services. In addition, we have generated revenue under the Corium Consulting Agreement and other consulting arrangements for the performance of consulting services as well as reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party costs associated with those services.\nOn March 2, 2021, we announced that the FDA approved the NDA for AZSTARYS, a once-daily product for the treatment of ADHD in patients ranging from six years and older. Corium will lead the commercialization of AZSTARYS per the KP415 License Agreement. Corium expects to make AZSTARYS commercially available in the U.S. as early as the second half of 2021.\nWe have had recurring negative cash flows from operations and, as of December 31, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $258.5 million. Our cash flows used in operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1.9 million and $23.7 million, respectively.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and minimal positive net cash flows from operations or negative net cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future, and those expenses and losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We anticipate that our expenses will fluctuate substantially as we:\n \u25cf continue our ongoing preclinical studies, clinical trials and our product development activities for our pipeline of product candidates; \u25cf seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \u25cf continue research and preclinical development and initiate clinical trials of our other product candidates; \u25cf seek to discover and develop additional product candidates either internally or in partnership with other pharmaceutical companies; \u25cf adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products; \u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and \u25cf incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company. \nOur commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from royalties earned from the sales of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In September 2019, we entered into the KP415 License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted an exclusive, worldwide license to Commave to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates containing SDX and d-MPH, including AZSTARYS and KP484. In October 2018, we entered into the APADAZ License Agreement with KVK, pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to KVK to commercialize APADAZ in the United States We cannot guarantee that either Commave or KVK will be able to successfully commercialize AZSTARYS or any of our product candidates covered under the KP415 License Agreement, or APADAZ, or that we will ever receive any payments under the APADAZ License Agreement from commercial sales of APADAZ or any future payments under the KP415 License Agreement. We also do not know when, if ever, any other product candidate will be commercially available. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt, the terms of these securities may restrict our ability to operate. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or altogether cease our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nRecent Financial Developments\nIn January and February 2021, we undertook a series of transactions to regain our Nasdaq Capital Market listing and improve our balance sheet. These included a reverse stock split, an underwritten public offering, or the Public Offering, a restructuring or our debt and ultimately a payoff of all remaining debt and a transaction in which we induced the holders of some of the warrants we issued in the public offering to exercise those warrants for cash.\nReverse Stock Split and Nasdaq Relisting\nEffective May 21, 2020, our common stock had been delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market and we began listing on the OTC Markets Venture Market under the symbol KMPH\u201d. In anticipation of the Public Offering, we determined we would need to regain our Nasdaq listing.\nIn order to relist our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock was required to satisfy the initial listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which including among others, that we have stockholders' equity of at least $5.0 million, a market value of unrestricted publicly held shares of at least $15.0 million, at least 1.0 million unrestricted publicly held shares, at least 300 unrestricted round lot stockholders, at least three market makers and a bid price of at least $4.00 per share, or, collectively, the Nasdaq Listing Requirements. Accordingly, on December 23, 2020, we effectuated a 1-for-16 reverse stock split of our common stock in order to satisfy the bid price component of the Nasdaq Listing Requirements.\nOn January 7, 2021, our common stock was approved for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on January 8, 2021 under the ticker symbol KMPH\u201d.\nDebt Restructuring\nIn anticipation of the Public Offering, and to meet the Nasdaq Listing Requirements, we agreed in December 2020 to restructure our outstanding senior secured convertible notes issued in December 2019 and January 2020, or the Senior Secured Notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $60.8 million and the senior secured convertible promissory note held by Deerfield Private Design Fund III, L.P., or Deerfield, in the principal amount of $7.5 million, or the Deerfield Note, and, collectively the Senior Secured Notes, the Facility Notes. The total outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Facility Notes was $69.4 million as of December 31, 2020.\nUnder the terms of the agreement we entered into with our lenders in connection with this debt restructuring, which we refer to as the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, on January 12, 2021, in connection with the closing of our Public Offering, we:\n \u25cf exchanged $31.5 million of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Facility Notes for (i) 31,476.98412 shares of our Series B-2 convertible preferred stock, and (ii) warrants exercisable for 3,632,019 shares of our common stock, or the Exchange Warrants; and \u25cf made a payment of $30.3 million, or the Debt Payment, in partial repayment of the remaining outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Facility Notes. \nEach share of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock issued pursuant to the December 2020 Exchange Agreement has a stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of our common stock at any time following the earlier of March 2, 2021 or our public announcement of the outcome of the FDA's review of our AZSTARYS NDA at the option of the holder thereof, subject to specified limits, at a conversion price of $6.4999. The shares of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock issued under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement are convertible into an aggregate of 4,842,690 shares of our common stock.\nThe Exchange Warrants have substantially the same terms and conditions as the warrants sold by us in our January 2021 underwritten offering.\nFollowing the completion of these transactions, the aggregate balance of principal and accrued interest remaining outstanding under the Facility Notes was approximately $7.6 million. With respect to this remaining outstanding balance under the Facility Notes, the December 2020 Exchange Agreement amended the terms of that debt to provide that:\n \u25cf the maturity date was changed to March 31, 2023, and the debt is prepayable upon specified conditions; and \u25cf interest would accrue at the rate of 6.75% per annum, payable quarterly, would be added to principal until June 30, 2021, and then be payable in cash thereafter. \nIn connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, we filed an amended and restated certificate of designation with the Secretary of State of Delaware in order to modify the terms of our authorized, but unissued, shares of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock to reflect those contemplated under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement.\nWe also filed a registration statement to register for resale under the Securities Act the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock and exercise of the Exchange Warrants.\nPublic Offering\nOn January 8, 2021, we issued and sold 6,765,463 shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 926,844 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 7,692,307 shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share of $6.50 in the Public Offering. In addition, we granted the underwriter for the Public Offering an option to purchase, for a period of 45 days, up to an additional 1,153,846 shares of our common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an additional 1,153,846 shares of our common stock. On January 8, 2021, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option, in part, for warrants to purchase 754,035 shares of our common stock. On January 12, 2021, we closed the Public Offering. Further, on February 1, 2021, the underwriter again exercised its over-allotment option, in part, to purchase 374,035 shares of our common stock. On February 3, 2021, we closed the underwriter's partial exercise of its over-allotment option.\nThe aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Public Offering, including from the exercises by the underwriter of its over-allotment option, totaled $52.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\nDecember 2020 Exchange Agreement Amendment\nOn January 12, 2021, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, we entered into an Amendment to Senior Secured Convertible Notes and Amendment to Warrant, or the January 2021 Amendment, with Deerfield and Deerfield Special Situations Fund, LP, collectively the Deerfield Holders. The January 2021 Amendment modified certain specified terms of (i) the Facility Notes and (ii) the warrant held be Deerfield, issued on June 2, 2014, or the Deerfield Warrant, to, among other things, exclude the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement and issuance of securities pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement from the anti-dilution provisions of the Facility Notes and the Deerfield Warrant.\nWarrant Exercise Inducement Letters and Issuance of Warrants\nOn January 26, 2021, we entered into warrant exercise inducement offer letters, or the Inducement Letters, with certain holders of warrants issued in the Public Offering, or the Existing Warrants, and collectively, the Exercising Holders, pursuant to which such holders exercised for cash their Existing Warrants to purchase 6,620,358 shares of our common stock in exchange for new warrants, or the Inducement Warrants, on substantially the same terms as the Existing Warrants, except as set forth in the following sentence, to purchase up to 7,944,430 shares of our common stock, which was equal to 120% of the number of shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants. The purchase price of the Inducement Warrants was $0.125 per share underlying each Inducement Warrant, and the Inducement Warrants have an exercise price of $6.36 per share. We received aggregate gross proceeds of $44.0 million from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Exercising Holders and the sale of the Inducement Warrants.\nWe also filed a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of the shares of our common stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of the Inducement Warrants which was declared effective on February 16, 2021.\nPayoff of Facility Agreement Notes and Termination of Facility Agreement\nOn February 8, 2021, we entered into a payoff letter with the Facility Note holders, pursuant to which we agreed to pay off and thereby terminate the Facility Agreement.\nPursuant to the payoff letter, we paid a total of $8.0 million to the Facility Note holders, representing the principal balance, accrued interest outstanding and a prepayment fee in repayment of our outstanding obligations under the Facility Agreement.\nPursuant to the payoff letter, all outstanding indebtedness and obligations of us owing to the Facility Note holders under the Facility Agreement have been paid in full. The Facility Agreement and the notes thereunder, as well as the security interests in the assets of us securing the Facility Agreement and note obligations, have been terminated.\nThird-Party Agreements\nKP415 License Agreement\nIn September 2019, we entered into the KP415 License Agreement with Commave. Under the KP415 License Agreement, we granted to Commave an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates containing SDX and d-MPH, including AZSTARYS, KP484, and, at the option of Commave, KP879, KP922 or any other product candidate developed by us containing SDX and developed to treat ADHD or any other central nervous system disorder, or the Additional Product Candidates and, collectively with AZSTARYS and KP484, the Licensed Product Candidates.\nUnder the terms of the KP415 License Agreement, we granted Commave an exclusive, worldwide license to commercialize and develop the Licensed Product Candidates; provided that such license shall apply to an Additional Product Candidates only if Commave exercises its option under the KP415 License Agreement related thereto. If Commave exercises its option related to any Additional Product Candidate under the KP415 License Agreement, the parties are obligated to negotiate in good faith regarding the economic terms of such Additional Product Candidate. We also granted to Commave a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize any Additional Product Candidate, with such right of first refusal expiring upon the acceptance of a new drug application for such Additional Product Candidate. We also granted Commave a right of first negotiation and a right of first refusal, subject to specified exceptions, for any assignment of our rights under the KP415 License Agreement.\nPursuant to the KP415 License Agreement, Commave paid us an upfront payment of $10.0 million and agreed to pay up to $63.0 million in milestone payments upon the occurrence of specified regulatory milestones related to AZSTARYS, including FDA approval and specified conditions with respect to the final approval label, and KP484. As a result of the FDA's approval of the AZSTARYS NDA, we have earned a regulatory milestone payment following FDA approval as provided under the KP415 License Agreement, and we are working with Commave to evaluate the related provisions and amounts. In addition, Commave agreed to make additional payments upon the achievement of specified U.S. sales milestones of up to $420.0 million in the aggregate, depending, among other things, on timing of approval for AZSTARYS and its final approved label, if any. In May 2020, the FDA accepted our NDA for AZSTARYS. Per the KP415 License Agreement, we received a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA. Further, Commave will pay us quarterly, tiered royalty payments ranging from a percentage in the high single digits to the mid-twenties of Net Sales (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) in the United States and a percentage in the low to mid-single digits of Net Sales in each country outside the United States, in each case subject to specified reductions under certain conditions as described in the KP415 License Agreement. Commave is obligated to make such royalty payments on a product-by-product basis until expiration of the Royalty Term (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) for the applicable product.\nCommave agreed to be responsible for and reimburse us for all of development, commercialization and regulatory expenses for the Licensed Product Candidates, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the KP415 License Agreement.\nThe KP415 License Agreement will continue on a product-by-product basis (i) until expiration of the Royalty Term for the applicable Licensed Product Candidate in the United States and (ii) perpetually for all other countries. Commave may terminate the KP415 License Agreement at its convenience upon prior written notice prior to regulatory approval of any Licensed Product Candidate or upon prior written notice after regulatory approval of any Licensed Product Candidate. We may terminate the KP415 License Agreement in full if Commave, any of its sublicensees or any of its or their affiliates challenge the validity of any Licensed Patent (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) and such challenge is not required under a court order or subpoena and is not a defense against a claim, action or proceeding asserted by us. Either party may terminate the KP415 License Agreement (i) upon a material breach of the KP415 License Agreement by the other party, subject to a cure period, or (ii) if the other party encounters bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon a Serious Material Breach (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) by us, subject to a cure period, Commave may choose not to terminate the KP415 License Agreement and instead reduce the milestone and royalty payments owed to us. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted by us to Commave pursuant to the KP415 License Agreement would revert to us. During the term of the KP415 License Agreement, we may not develop or commercialize any Competing Product (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement).\nThe KP415 License Agreement also established a joint steering committee, which monitors progress of the development of both AZSTARYS and KP484. Subject to the oversight of the joint steering committee, we otherwise retain all responsibility for the conduct of all regulatory activities required to obtain new drug application approval of AZSTARYS and KP484; provided that Commave shall be the sponsor of any clinical trials conducted by us on behalf of Commave.\nAPADAZ License Agreement\nIn October 2018, we entered into the APADAZ License Agreement with KVK pursuant to which we have granted an exclusive license to KVK to conduct regulatory activities for, manufacture and commercialize APADAZ in the United States.\nPursuant to the APADAZ License Agreement, KVK has agreed to pay us certain payments and cost reimbursements of an estimated $3.4 million, which includes a payment of $2.0 million within 10 days of the achievement of a specified milestone related to the initial formulary adoption of APADAZ, or the Initial Adoption Milestone. In addition, KVK has agreed to make additional payments to us upon the achievement of specified sales milestones of up to $53.0 million in the aggregate. Further, we and KVK will share the quarterly net profits of APADAZ by KVK in the United States at specified tiered percentages, ranging from us receiving 30% to 50% of net profits, based on the amount of net sales on a rolling four quarter basis. We are responsible for a portion of commercialization and regulatory expenses for APADAZ until the Initial Adoption Milestone is achieved, after which KVK will be responsible for all expenses incurred in connection with commercialization and maintaining regulatory approval in the United States.\nThe APADAZ License Agreement will terminate on the later of the date that all of the patent rights for APADAZ have expired in the United States or KVK's cessation of commercialization of APADAZ in the United States. KVK may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement upon 90 days written notice if a regulatory authority in the United States orders KVK to stop sales of APADAZ due to a safety concern. In addition, after the third anniversary of the APADAZ License Agreement, KVK may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement without cause upon 18 months prior written notice. We may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement if KVK stops conducting regulatory activities for or commercializing APADAZ in the United States for a period of six months, subject to specified exceptions, or if KVK or its affiliates challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patent under the APADAZ License Agreement. Both parties may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement (i) upon a material breach of the APADAZ License Agreement, subject to a 30-day cure period, (ii) the other party encounters bankruptcy or insolvency or (iii) if the Initial Adoption Milestone is not achieved. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted by us to KVK pursuant to the APADAZ License Agreement would revert to us.\nThe APADAZ License Agreement also established a joint steering committee, which monitors progress of the commercialization of APADAZ.\nOther Third-Party Agreements\nUnder our March 2012 asset purchase agreement with Shire, Shire had a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize AZSTARYS and KP484. In early 2019, Shire was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd, or Takeda, to whom this right of first refusal was transferred at that time. Takeda did not exercise this right of first refusal in connection with our entry into the KP415 License Agreement.\nUnder our March 2012 termination agreement with Aquestive, Aquestive has the right to receive a royalty amount equal to 10% of any value generated by AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879, and any product candidates containing SDX, including royalty payments on any license of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879, the sale of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879 to a third party, the commercialization of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879 and the portion of any consideration that is attributable to the value of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879 and paid to us or our stockholders in a change of control transaction. In connection with the KP415 License Agreement, we paid Aquestive a royalty equal to 10% of the upfront license payment we received in the third quarter of 2019 and the regulatory milestone payment we received in the second quarter of 2020.\nIn July 2020, we entered into the Corium Consulting Agreement under which Corium engaged us to guide the product development and regulatory activities for certain current and potential future products in their portfolio, as well as continue supporting preparation for the potential commercial launch of AZSTARYS. Under the Corium Consulting Agreement, we are entitled to receive payments from Corium of up to $15.6 million, $13.6 million of which will be paid in quarterly installments through March 31, 2022. The remaining $2.0 million is conditioned upon the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone related to Corium's product portfolio. Corium also agreed to be responsible for and reimburse us for all development, commercialization and regulatory expenses incurred as part of the performance of the consulting services.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of AZSTARYS, APADAZ or any of our other product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. We expect that our only source of revenues will be through payments arising from our license agreements with Commave and KVK, and through any other future arrangements related to one of our other product candidates. To date, we have generated revenue from the KP415 License Agreement in the form of the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million, of which we paid Aquestive $1.0 million as a royalty payment, a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA, of which we paid Aquestive $0.5 million as a royalty payment, reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs and payments related to the performance of consulting services. In addition, we have generated revenue under the Corium Consulting Agreement and other consulting arrangements for the performance of consulting services as well as reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party costs associated with those services. We cannot guarantee that either Commave or KVK will be able to successfully commercialize AZSTARYS or our product candidates covered under the KP415 License Agreement, or APADAZ, or that we will ever receive any payments under the KP415 License Agreement from commercial sales of APADAZ or any future payments under the APADAZ License Agreement. We also do not know when, if ever, any other product candidate will be commercially available.\nRoyalties and Contract Costs\nThe components of our royalties and contract costs are royalties and expenses directly attributable to revenue. To date, we have generated revenue from the KP415 License Agreement in the form of the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million, a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA, reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs and payments related to the performance of consulting services. In connection with the KP415 License Agreement, we paid Aquestive a royalty equal to 10% of the upfront license payment we received in the third quarter of 2019 and 10% of the regulatory milestone, related to the acceptance of the NDA, we received in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we capitalized incremental costs directly attributable to the KP415 License Agreement, these costs are amortized to royalties and contract costs as revenue is recognized.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into three categories: research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and severance expense. Salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, comprise a significant component of each of these expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with our facilities, information technology costs and depreciation and amortization between research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses based on employee headcount and the nature of work performed by each employee.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists of expenses incurred while performing research and development activities to discover and develop potential product candidates. This includes conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expense primarily consists of:\n\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\nWe anticipate that our research and development expense will fluctuate for the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to advance the development of our product candidates, subject to the availability of additional funding. In accordance with the KP415 License Agreement, Commave has also agreed to be responsible and reimburse us for all of development, commercialization and regulatory expenses for the Licensed Product Candidates, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the KP415 License Agreement.\nThe successful commercialization of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our other product candidates that may be approved and the development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs required to commercialize AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other product candidates, if approved, and complete the remaining development of any product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the commercialization and development of our products and product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and any stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes personnel in executive, finance, human resources and administrative support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, consulting costs and costs of our information systems.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expense will fluctuate as we continue to operate as a public reporting company and continue to develop our product candidates. We believe that these fluctuations will likely include costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees for outside consultants, lawyers and accountants. We also expect to continue to incur costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations, disclosure and similar requirements applicable to public reporting companies.\nSeverance Expense\nSeverance expense in 2020 consisted of severance payments and stock-based compensation paid to our former chief business officer who ceased to serve in this role in February 2020. We had no severance expense in 2019.\nOther (Expense) Income\nOther (expense) income consists primarily of non-cash costs associated with fair value adjustments to our derivative and warrant liability and amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount to interest expense. Other (expense) income also includes interest expense incurred on our outstanding borrowings, as well as, interest and other income consisting primarily of interest earned on investments. These items are unrelated to our core business and thus are recognized as other (expense) income in our statements of operations.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit consists of refundable state income tax credits. To date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal or state income taxes because we have not generated taxable income. We have received state income tax credits related to our qualified research activities in Iowa.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $12.8 million, a decrease of $11.8 million compared to net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $24.5 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in loss from operations of $14.7 million, partially offset by a change in non-cash fair value adjustment from income of $2.0 million in 2019 to expense of $0.2 million in 2020, related to changes to the derivative and warrant liability, and an increase in net interest expense and other items of $0.8 million.\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $0.4 million, from $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting revenue of $5.3 million, primarily related to the Corium Consulting Agreement, and an increase in reimbursement revenue of $0.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in licensing and milestone revenue of $5.0 million, due to the one-time non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million received in 2019 compared to, the $5.0 million payment received related to the regulatory milestone in 2020 both pursuant to the KP415 License Agreement.\nRoyalties and Contract Costs\nRoyalties and contract costs decreased by $1.6 million, from $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in royalties due to Aquestive of $0.5 million related to the upfront and milestone payments we received in 2019 and 2020 discussed above and a decrease in the amortization of capitalized contract costs which were directly attributable to the revenue recognized of $1.1 million.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $10.6 million, from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net third-party research and development costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $2.9 million, from $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional fees and personnel-related costs.\nSeverance Expense\nSeverance expense of $0.8 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the termination of our chief business officer in February 2020. Severance expense is comprised of $0.4 million of personnel and other related charges and $0.4 million of stock compensation expense related to the acceleration of vesting on certain stock options upon employee termination. We had no severance expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther (Expense) Income\nOther expenses increased by $3.0 million, from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This period-to-period increase in expense was primarily attributable to a change in non-cash fair value adjustment from income of $2.0 million in 2019 to expense of $0.2 million in 2020 related to our derivative and warrant liability and an increase in net interest expense and other items of $0.8 million.\nComparison for Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nFor a discussion and analysis of changes in financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nThrough December 31, 2020, we have funded our research and development and operating activities primarily through the issuance of debt, private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial public offering, at-the-market offering, underwritten public offerings, through our purchase agreements with Lincoln Park Capital LLC, or Lincoln Park, and from revenue received under the KP415 License Agreement, the Corium Consulting Agreement and other consulting arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 million and restricted cash of $0.1 million.\nIn February 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement for an equity line of credit, or the 2019 ELOC Agreement, with Lincoln Park, which provided that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, we may sell to Lincoln Park up to $15.0 million of shares of our common stock, from time to time over the 36-month term of the 2019 ELOC Agreement, and upon execution of the 2019 ELOC Agreement we issued an additional 7,512 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares in accordance with the closing conditions contained within the 2019 ELOC Agreement. In February 2020, upon entering into a new purchase agreement for an equity line of credit, or the 2020 ELOC Agreement, with Lincoln Park, we terminated the 2019 ELOC Agreement. As a result, we will not make any future sales under the 2019 ELOC Agreement. Through the date of termination, we sold 212,579 shares of our common stock (exclusive of the 7,512 commitment shares) to Lincoln Park under the 2019 ELOC Agreement for approximately $5.4 million in gross proceeds.\nIn September 2019, we entered into the KP415 License Agreement with Commave and Commave paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million. In May 2020, the FDA accepted our NDA for AZSTARYS. Per the KP415 License Agreement, we received a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA. In July 2020, we entered into the Corium Consulting Agreement under which Corium engaged us to guide the product development and regulatory activities for certain current and potential future products in their portfolio, as well as continue supporting preparation for the potential commercial launch of AZSTARYS. Under the Corium Consulting Agreement, we are entitled to receive payments from Corium of up to $15.6 million, $13.6 million of which will be paid in quarterly installments through March 31, 2022. The remaining $2.0 million is conditioned upon the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone related to Corium's product portfolio. Corium also agreed to be responsible for and reimburse us for all development, commercialization and regulatory expenses incurred as part of the performance of the consulting services.\nIn February 2020, we entered into the 2020 ELOC Agreement, with Lincoln Park, which provided that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, we may sell to Lincoln Park up to $4.0 million of shares of our common stock, from time to time over the 12-month term of the 2020 ELOC Agreement, and upon execution of the 2020 ELOC Agreement we issued an additional 19,289 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares in accordance with the closing conditions contained within the 2020 ELOC Agreement. In May 2020, we reached the maximum allowable shares to be issued under the Current Registration Statement of 579,260 shares and therefore we cannot issue additional shares under the 2020 ELOC Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we have sold 559,971 shares of common stock (exclusive of the 19,289 commitment shares previously issued to Lincoln Park) under the 2020 ELOC Agreement for approximately $2.3 million in gross proceeds.\nWe have had recurring negative operating cash flows and, as of December 31, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $258.5 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur minimal positive net cash flows from operations or negative net cash flows from operations for at least the next several years. We expect that our sources of revenue will be through payments arising from our license agreements with Commave and KVK, or through our Corium Consulting Agreement, and other potential consulting arrangements and any other future arrangements related to one of our other product candidates.\nIn January 2021, we completed the Public Offering. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Public Offering, including from the exercises by the underwriter of its over-allotment option, totaled $52.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\nIn January 2021, we entered into the Inducement Letters. We received aggregate gross proceeds of $44.0 million from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Exercising Holders and the sale of the Inducement Warrants.\nOn April 23, 2020, we received proceeds of $0.8 million from a loan, or the PPP Loan, under the Paycheck Protection Program, or the PPP, of the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, a portion of which may be forgiven, which we used to retain current employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments. The PPP Loan matures on April 23, 2022 and bears annual interest at a rate of 1.0%. Payments of principal and interest on the PPP Loan are deferred for the first 16 months of the PPP Loan term. Thereafter, we could be required to pay the lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest.\nThe CARES Act and the PPP provide a mechanism for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed. Under the PPP, we may apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or part of the PPP Loan. The amount of loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness was originally based on a formula that takes into account a number of factors, including the amount of loan proceeds used by us during the 24-week period after the loan origination for certain purposes, including payroll costs, interest on certain mortgage obligations, rent payments on certain leases, and certain qualified utility payments, provided that at least 60% of the loan amount was used for eligible payroll costs. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on loan forgiveness, only loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered 24-week period qualify for forgiveness. We have applied for forgiveness under the provisions of the PPP loan and are awaiting a decision by the SBA.\nConvertible Debt\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $68.2 million of convertible notes outstanding, consisting of senior secured convertible promissory notes issued, under the Deerfield Facility Agreement with Deerfield. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we repaid in full the convertible notes and terminated the Deerfield Facility Agreement.\nDeerfield Facility Agreement\nIn June 2014, we entered into the Deerfield Facility Agreement as a $60.0 million multi-tranche credit facility with Deerfield. At the time we entered into the Deerfield Facility Agreement, we borrowed the first tranche, which consisted of a $15.0 million term note and the $10.0 million convertible note, or the Deerfield Convertible Note.\nThe Deerfield Convertible Note originally bore interest at 9.75% per annum, but was subsequently reduced to 6.75%. Interest accrued on the outstanding balance under the Deerfield Convertible Note was due quarterly in arrears. We originally had to repay one-third of the outstanding principal amount of the Deerfield Convertible Note on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Deerfield Facility Agreement (June 2018 and June 2019). In June 2018, Deerfield agreed to convert the $3,333,333 of the principal amount then due, plus $168,288 of accrued interest, into 37,410 shares of our common stock. In September 2019, we entered into an amendment with Deerfield in order to (i) reduce the interest rate applicable under the Deerfield Facility Agreement from 9.75% to 6.75%, (ii) provide for payment in kind\u201d of interest on the Loans (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement), and (iii) defer the Loan payments due pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement until June 1, 2020. In December 2019, we entered into another amendment with Deerfield in order to (i) defer the Loan payments due pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement until March 31, 2021 and (ii) allow for the entries of additional debt and debt holders under the Deerfield Facility Agreement (as discussed in more detail below).\nPursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement, we issued to Deerfield 1,923,077 shares of our Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, or Series D Preferred, as consideration for the loans provided to us thereunder. Upon closing of our initial public offering, these shares of Series D Preferred reclassified into 16,025 shares of our common stock.\nWe also issued to Deerfield the Deerfield Warrant to purchase 14,423,076 shares of our Series D Preferred at an initial exercise price of $0.78 per share, or the Deerfield Warrant. Upon closing of our initial public offering, this warrant converted into a warrant exercisable for 120,192 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $93.60 per share.\n2021 Notes\nIn February 2016, we issued our 5.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2021, or the 2021 Notes, in aggregate principal amount of $86.3 million. The 2021 Notes were originally issued to Cowen and Company and RBCCM LLC as representatives of the several initial purchasers, who subsequently resold the 2021 Notes to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act.\nThe 2021 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of February 9, 2016, or the indenture, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Interest on the 2021 Notes was payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2016, at a rate of 5.50% per year. The 2021 Notes originally matured on February 1, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased.\nAs described in more detail below, in multiple exchanges occurring in October 2018, December 2019 and January 2020, all outstanding 2021 Notes were exchanged by the holders thereof for either shares of our common stock or the December 2019 Notes and January 2020 Note issued under the terms of the Deerfield Facility Agreement.\n2021 Note Exchanges\n2021 Note Exchange Effected in October 2018\nIn October 2018, we entered into an exchange agreement, or the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, with the Deerfield Lenders. Under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, the Deerfield Lenders exchanged an aggregate of $9,577,000 principal amount of our 2021 Notes for an aggregate of 9,577 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001, or the Series A Preferred Stock.\nAs a condition to closing of the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, we filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series A Certificate of Designation, with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of our common stock at a price equal to $48.00 per share (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events). Immediately following the exchange under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, an aggregate of 3,192,333 shares of common stock were issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2020, all 9,577 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement have been converted into an aggregate 199,519 shares of our common stock.\n2021 Note Exchange Effected in September 2019\nIn September 2019, we entered into an Exchange Agreement and Amendment to Facility Agreement, or the September 2019 Exchange Agreement with the Deerfield Lenders. Under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 493,742 shares of our common stock and an aggregate of 1,576 shares of our Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, or the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, (such shares of common stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Initial Exchange Shares), in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $3,000,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes. The September 2019 Exchange Agreement provided the Deerfield Lenders the option to exchange up to an additional aggregate of $27,000,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, or the Optional Exchange Principal Amount, for shares of common stock or shares of our Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, or the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, and, together with the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, including limits as to the principal amount that can be exchanged prior to specified dates therein. If the Deerfield Lenders choose to exchange any portion of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount for shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock, such exchange will be effected at an exchange price of $1,000 per share. If the Deerfield Lenders choose to exchange any portion of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount for shares of common stock, such exchange will be effected at an exchange price equal to the greater of (i) $15.1904 or (ii) the average of the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange.\nAs a condition to closing of the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, we filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series B-1 Certificate of Designation, and a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation, with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively.\nEach share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a per share price equal to $15.1904 per share (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events). There was an aggregate of 103,749 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described below). Each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a per share price equal to the greater of (i) $15.1904 (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events), or (ii) the average of the volume-weighted average prices of the common stock on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange. Immediately following the exchange under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, there was an aggregate of 1,777,437 shares of Common Stock issuable (i) in exchange of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount, or (ii) upon conversion of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock issuable in exchange of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount (in each case without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described below).\nThe Series B Preferred Stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Deerfield Lenders; provided that the Deerfield Lenders are prohibited from converting shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of common stock if, as a result of such conversion, such holders (together with certain affiliates and group\u201d members of such holders) would beneficially own more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding. The Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemable. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Deerfield Lenders will receive an amount equal to $0.0001 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends, and thereafter will share ratably in any distribution of our assets with holders of common stock and with the holders of any shares of any other class or series of capital stock of us entitled to share in such remaining assets of us (including our Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. With respect to rights upon liquidation, the Series B Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock, on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, if any is outstanding, and junior to existing and future indebtedness. Except as otherwise required by law (or with respect to approval of certain actions involving our organizational documents that materially and adversely affect the holders of Series B Preferred Stock), the Series B Preferred Stock does not have voting rights. The Series B Preferred Stock is not subject to any price-based anti-dilution protections and does not provide for any accruing dividends, but provides that holders of Series B Preferred Stock will participate in any dividends on the common stock on an as-converted basis (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described above). The Series B-1 Certificate of Designation and the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation also provide for partial liquidated damages in the event that we fail to timely convert shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock or Series B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively, into common stock in accordance with the applicable Certificate of Designation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, all 1,576 shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock have been converted into 103,749 shares of common stock, and there were no shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock outstanding.\n2021 Note Exchange Effected in December 2019\nIn December 2019, we entered into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement and Amendment to Facility Agreement, Senior Secured Convertible Notes and Warrants, or the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, with the Deerfield Lenders and Delaware Street Capital Master Fund, L.P., or DSC and, collectively with the Deerfield Lenders, the December 2019 Holders. Under the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, we issued the December 2019 Notes as senior secured convertible promissory notes under the Deerfield Facility Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $71,418,011 in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $71,418,011 principal amount and accrued interest of the 2021 Notes. Upon entering into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, we agreed to pay the December 2019 Holders, in the aggregate, an interest payment of $745,011, which represents 50% of the accrued interest, as of December 18, 2019, on the 2021 Notes owned by the December 2019 Holders. The remainder of such interest was included in the principal amount of the December 2019 Notes.\nThe December 2019 Notes bear interest at 6.75% per annum. The December 2019 Notes were originally convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $17.11 per share (which represents the conversion price of the 2021 Notes), subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the December 2019 Notes. As of the date of issuance, the December 2019 Notes were convertible, by their terms, into an aggregate of 260,876 shares of our common stock. We subsequently amended the December 2019 Notes to provide that such notes shall be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $93.60 per share (which represents the conversion price of the Deerfield Convertible Note). The conversion price of the December 2019 Notes will be adjusted downward if we issue or sell any shares of common stock, convertible securities, warrants or options at a sale or exercise price per share less than the greater of the December 2019 Notes' conversion price or the closing sale price of our common stock on the last trading date immediately prior to such issuance, or, in the case of a firm commitment underwritten offering, on the date of execution of the underwriting agreement between us and", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs to treat serious medical conditions through our proprietary LAT technology. We utilize our proprietary LAT technology to generate improved prodrug versions of drugs approved by the FDA as well as to generate prodrug versions of existing compounds that may have applications for new disease indications. Our product candidate pipeline is focused on the high need areas of ADHD, SUD and IH. Our co-lead clinical development candidates, AZSTARYS (formerly referred to as KP415) and KP484, are both based on a prodrug of d-MPH but with differing ER effect profiles, and are intended for the treatment of ADHD. Our clinical product candidate for the treatment of SUD is KP879, based on a prodrug of d-MPH. Our preclinical prodrug product candidate for the treatment of IH is KP1077. We have entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Commave for the development, manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates containing SDX and d-MPH. In addition, we have announced our commercial partnership with KVK of APADAZ, an FDA approved IR combination product of benzhydrocodone, our prodrug of hydrocodone, and APAP for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.\nWe expect that our sources of revenues will be through payments arising from our license agreements with Commave and KVK, our consulting agreement with Corium and through other consulting arrangements and any other future arrangements we might enter into related to one of our other product candidates. To date, we have generated revenue from the KP415 License Agreement in the form of the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million, of which we paid Aquestive $1.0 million as a royalty payment, a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA, of which we paid Aquestive $0.5 million as a royalty payment, reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs and payments related to the performance of consulting services. In addition, we have generated revenue under the Corium Consulting Agreement and other consulting arrangements for the performance of consulting services as well as reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party costs associated with those services.\nOn March 2, 2021, we announced that the FDA approved the NDA for AZSTARYS, a once-daily product for the treatment of ADHD in patients ranging from six years and older. Corium will lead the commercialization of AZSTARYS per the KP415 License Agreement. Corium expects to make AZSTARYS commercially available in the U.S. as early as the second half of 2021.\nWe have had recurring negative cash flows from operations and, as of December 31, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $258.5 million. Our cash flows used in operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1.9 million and $23.7 million, respectively.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and minimal positive net cash flows from operations or negative net cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future, and those expenses and losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We anticipate that our expenses will fluctuate substantially as we:\n \u25cf continue our ongoing preclinical studies, clinical trials and our product development activities for our pipeline of product candidates; \u25cf seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \u25cf continue research and preclinical development and initiate clinical trials of our other product candidates; \u25cf seek to discover and develop additional product candidates either internally or in partnership with other pharmaceutical companies; \u25cf adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products; \u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and \u25cf incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company. \nOur commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from royalties earned from the sales of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In September 2019, we entered into the KP415 License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted an exclusive, worldwide license to Commave to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates containing SDX and d-MPH, including AZSTARYS and KP484. In October 2018, we entered into the APADAZ License Agreement with KVK, pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to KVK to commercialize APADAZ in the United States We cannot guarantee that either Commave or KVK will be able to successfully commercialize AZSTARYS or any of our product candidates covered under the KP415 License Agreement, or APADAZ, or that we will ever receive any payments under the APADAZ License Agreement from commercial sales of APADAZ or any future payments under the KP415 License Agreement. We also do not know when, if ever, any other product candidate will be commercially available. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt, the terms of these securities may restrict our ability to operate. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or altogether cease our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nRecent Financial Developments\nIn January and February 2021, we undertook a series of transactions to regain our Nasdaq Capital Market listing and improve our balance sheet. These included a reverse stock split, an underwritten public offering, or the Public Offering, a restructuring or our debt and ultimately a payoff of all remaining debt and a transaction in which we induced the holders of some of the warrants we issued in the public offering to exercise those warrants for cash.\nReverse Stock Split and Nasdaq Relisting\nEffective May 21, 2020, our common stock had been delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market and we began listing on the OTC Markets Venture Market under the symbol KMPH\u201d. In anticipation of the Public Offering, we determined we would need to regain our Nasdaq listing.\nIn order to relist our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock was required to satisfy the initial listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which including among others, that we have stockholders' equity of at least $5.0 million, a market value of unrestricted publicly held shares of at least $15.0 million, at least 1.0 million unrestricted publicly held shares, at least 300 unrestricted round lot stockholders, at least three market makers and a bid price of at least $4.00 per share, or, collectively, the Nasdaq Listing Requirements. Accordingly, on December 23, 2020, we effectuated a 1-for-16 reverse stock split of our common stock in order to satisfy the bid price component of the Nasdaq Listing Requirements.\nOn January 7, 2021, our common stock was approved for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on January 8, 2021 under the ticker symbol KMPH\u201d.\nDebt Restructuring\nIn anticipation of the Public Offering, and to meet the Nasdaq Listing Requirements, we agreed in December 2020 to restructure our outstanding senior secured convertible notes issued in December 2019 and January 2020, or the Senior Secured Notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $60.8 million and the senior secured convertible promissory note held by Deerfield Private Design Fund III, L.P., or Deerfield, in the principal amount of $7.5 million, or the Deerfield Note, and, collectively the Senior Secured Notes, the Facility Notes. The total outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Facility Notes was $69.4 million as of December 31, 2020.\nUnder the terms of the agreement we entered into with our lenders in connection with this debt restructuring, which we refer to as the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, on January 12, 2021, in connection with the closing of our Public Offering, we:\n \u25cf exchanged $31.5 million of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Facility Notes for (i) 31,476.98412 shares of our Series B-2 convertible preferred stock, and (ii) warrants exercisable for 3,632,019 shares of our common stock, or the Exchange Warrants; and \u25cf made a payment of $30.3 million, or the Debt Payment, in partial repayment of the remaining outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Facility Notes. \nEach share of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock issued pursuant to the December 2020 Exchange Agreement has a stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of our common stock at any time following the earlier of March 2, 2021 or our public announcement of the outcome of the FDA's review of our AZSTARYS NDA at the option of the holder thereof, subject to specified limits, at a conversion price of $6.4999. The shares of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock issued under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement are convertible into an aggregate of 4,842,690 shares of our common stock.\nThe Exchange Warrants have substantially the same terms and conditions as the warrants sold by us in our January 2021 underwritten offering.\nFollowing the completion of these transactions, the aggregate balance of principal and accrued interest remaining outstanding under the Facility Notes was approximately $7.6 million. With respect to this remaining outstanding balance under the Facility Notes, the December 2020 Exchange Agreement amended the terms of that debt to provide that:\n \u25cf the maturity date was changed to March 31, 2023, and the debt is prepayable upon specified conditions; and \u25cf interest would accrue at the rate of 6.75% per annum, payable quarterly, would be added to principal until June 30, 2021, and then be payable in cash thereafter. \nIn connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, we filed an amended and restated certificate of designation with the Secretary of State of Delaware in order to modify the terms of our authorized, but unissued, shares of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock to reflect those contemplated under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement.\nWe also filed a registration statement to register for resale under the Securities Act the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock and exercise of the Exchange Warrants.\nPublic Offering\nOn January 8, 2021, we issued and sold 6,765,463 shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 926,844 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 7,692,307 shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share of $6.50 in the Public Offering. In addition, we granted the underwriter for the Public Offering an option to purchase, for a period of 45 days, up to an additional 1,153,846 shares of our common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an additional 1,153,846 shares of our common stock. On January 8, 2021, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option, in part, for warrants to purchase 754,035 shares of our common stock. On January 12, 2021, we closed the Public Offering. Further, on February 1, 2021, the underwriter again exercised its over-allotment option, in part, to purchase 374,035 shares of our common stock. On February 3, 2021, we closed the underwriter's partial exercise of its over-allotment option.\nThe aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Public Offering, including from the exercises by the underwriter of its over-allotment option, totaled $52.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\nDecember 2020 Exchange Agreement Amendment\nOn January 12, 2021, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, we entered into an Amendment to Senior Secured Convertible Notes and Amendment to Warrant, or the January 2021 Amendment, with Deerfield and Deerfield Special Situations Fund, LP, collectively the Deerfield Holders. The January 2021 Amendment modified certain specified terms of (i) the Facility Notes and (ii) the warrant held be Deerfield, issued on June 2, 2014, or the Deerfield Warrant, to, among other things, exclude the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement and issuance of securities pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement from the anti-dilution provisions of the Facility Notes and the Deerfield Warrant.\nWarrant Exercise Inducement Letters and Issuance of Warrants\nOn January 26, 2021, we entered into warrant exercise inducement offer letters, or the Inducement Letters, with certain holders of warrants issued in the Public Offering, or the Existing Warrants, and collectively, the Exercising Holders, pursuant to which such holders exercised for cash their Existing Warrants to purchase 6,620,358 shares of our common stock in exchange for new warrants, or the Inducement Warrants, on substantially the same terms as the Existing Warrants, except as set forth in the following sentence, to purchase up to 7,944,430 shares of our common stock, which was equal to 120% of the number of shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants. The purchase price of the Inducement Warrants was $0.125 per share underlying each Inducement Warrant, and the Inducement Warrants have an exercise price of $6.36 per share. We received aggregate gross proceeds of $44.0 million from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Exercising Holders and the sale of the Inducement Warrants.\nWe also filed a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of the shares of our common stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of the Inducement Warrants which was declared effective on February 16, 2021.\nPayoff of Facility Agreement Notes and Termination of Facility Agreement\nOn February 8, 2021, we entered into a payoff letter with the Facility Note holders, pursuant to which we agreed to pay off and thereby terminate the Facility Agreement.\nPursuant to the payoff letter, we paid a total of $8.0 million to the Facility Note holders, representing the principal balance, accrued interest outstanding and a prepayment fee in repayment of our outstanding obligations under the Facility Agreement.\nPursuant to the payoff letter, all outstanding indebtedness and obligations of us owing to the Facility Note holders under the Facility Agreement have been paid in full. The Facility Agreement and the notes thereunder, as well as the security interests in the assets of us securing the Facility Agreement and note obligations, have been terminated.\nThird-Party Agreements\nKP415 License Agreement\nIn September 2019, we entered into the KP415 License Agreement with Commave. Under the KP415 License Agreement, we granted to Commave an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates containing SDX and d-MPH, including AZSTARYS, KP484, and, at the option of Commave, KP879, KP922 or any other product candidate developed by us containing SDX and developed to treat ADHD or any other central nervous system disorder, or the Additional Product Candidates and, collectively with AZSTARYS and KP484, the Licensed Product Candidates.\nUnder the terms of the KP415 License Agreement, we granted Commave an exclusive, worldwide license to commercialize and develop the Licensed Product Candidates; provided that such license shall apply to an Additional Product Candidates only if Commave exercises its option under the KP415 License Agreement related thereto. If Commave exercises its option related to any Additional Product Candidate under the KP415 License Agreement, the parties are obligated to negotiate in good faith regarding the economic terms of such Additional Product Candidate. We also granted to Commave a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize any Additional Product Candidate, with such right of first refusal expiring upon the acceptance of a new drug application for such Additional Product Candidate. We also granted Commave a right of first negotiation and a right of first refusal, subject to specified exceptions, for any assignment of our rights under the KP415 License Agreement.\nPursuant to the KP415 License Agreement, Commave paid us an upfront payment of $10.0 million and agreed to pay up to $63.0 million in milestone payments upon the occurrence of specified regulatory milestones related to AZSTARYS, including FDA approval and specified conditions with respect to the final approval label, and KP484. As a result of the FDA's approval of the AZSTARYS NDA, we have earned a regulatory milestone payment following FDA approval as provided under the KP415 License Agreement, and we are working with Commave to evaluate the related provisions and amounts. In addition, Commave agreed to make additional payments upon the achievement of specified U.S. sales milestones of up to $420.0 million in the aggregate, depending, among other things, on timing of approval for AZSTARYS and its final approved label, if any. In May 2020, the FDA accepted our NDA for AZSTARYS. Per the KP415 License Agreement, we received a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA. Further, Commave will pay us quarterly, tiered royalty payments ranging from a percentage in the high single digits to the mid-twenties of Net Sales (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) in the United States and a percentage in the low to mid-single digits of Net Sales in each country outside the United States, in each case subject to specified reductions under certain conditions as described in the KP415 License Agreement. Commave is obligated to make such royalty payments on a product-by-product basis until expiration of the Royalty Term (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) for the applicable product.\nCommave agreed to be responsible for and reimburse us for all of development, commercialization and regulatory expenses for the Licensed Product Candidates, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the KP415 License Agreement.\nThe KP415 License Agreement will continue on a product-by-product basis (i) until expiration of the Royalty Term for the applicable Licensed Product Candidate in the United States and (ii) perpetually for all other countries. Commave may terminate the KP415 License Agreement at its convenience upon prior written notice prior to regulatory approval of any Licensed Product Candidate or upon prior written notice after regulatory approval of any Licensed Product Candidate. We may terminate the KP415 License Agreement in full if Commave, any of its sublicensees or any of its or their affiliates challenge the validity of any Licensed Patent (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) and such challenge is not required under a court order or subpoena and is not a defense against a claim, action or proceeding asserted by us. Either party may terminate the KP415 License Agreement (i) upon a material breach of the KP415 License Agreement by the other party, subject to a cure period, or (ii) if the other party encounters bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon a Serious Material Breach (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) by us, subject to a cure period, Commave may choose not to terminate the KP415 License Agreement and instead reduce the milestone and royalty payments owed to us. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted by us to Commave pursuant to the KP415 License Agreement would revert to us. During the term of the KP415 License Agreement, we may not develop or commercialize any Competing Product (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement).\nThe KP415 License Agreement also established a joint steering committee, which monitors progress of the development of both AZSTARYS and KP484. Subject to the oversight of the joint steering committee, we otherwise retain all responsibility for the conduct of all regulatory activities required to obtain new drug application approval of AZSTARYS and KP484; provided that Commave shall be the sponsor of any clinical trials conducted by us on behalf of Commave.\nAPADAZ License Agreement\nIn October 2018, we entered into the APADAZ License Agreement with KVK pursuant to which we have granted an exclusive license to KVK to conduct regulatory activities for, manufacture and commercialize APADAZ in the United States.\nPursuant to the APADAZ License Agreement, KVK has agreed to pay us certain payments and cost reimbursements of an estimated $3.4 million, which includes a payment of $2.0 million within 10 days of the achievement of a specified milestone related to the initial formulary adoption of APADAZ, or the Initial Adoption Milestone. In addition, KVK has agreed to make additional payments to us upon the achievement of specified sales milestones of up to $53.0 million in the aggregate. Further, we and KVK will share the quarterly net profits of APADAZ by KVK in the United States at specified tiered percentages, ranging from us receiving 30% to 50% of net profits, based on the amount of net sales on a rolling four quarter basis. We are responsible for a portion of commercialization and regulatory expenses for APADAZ until the Initial Adoption Milestone is achieved, after which KVK will be responsible for all expenses incurred in connection with commercialization and maintaining regulatory approval in the United States.\nThe APADAZ License Agreement will terminate on the later of the date that all of the patent rights for APADAZ have expired in the United States or KVK's cessation of commercialization of APADAZ in the United States. KVK may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement upon 90 days written notice if a regulatory authority in the United States orders KVK to stop sales of APADAZ due to a safety concern. In addition, after the third anniversary of the APADAZ License Agreement, KVK may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement without cause upon 18 months prior written notice. We may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement if KVK stops conducting regulatory activities for or commercializing APADAZ in the United States for a period of six months, subject to specified exceptions, or if KVK or its affiliates challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patent under the APADAZ License Agreement. Both parties may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement (i) upon a material breach of the APADAZ License Agreement, subject to a 30-day cure period, (ii) the other party encounters bankruptcy or insolvency or (iii) if the Initial Adoption Milestone is not achieved. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted by us to KVK pursuant to the APADAZ License Agreement would revert to us.\nThe APADAZ License Agreement also established a joint steering committee, which monitors progress of the commercialization of APADAZ.\nOther Third-Party Agreements\nUnder our March 2012 asset purchase agreement with Shire, Shire had a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize AZSTARYS and KP484. In early 2019, Shire was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd, or Takeda, to whom this right of first refusal was transferred at that time. Takeda did not exercise this right of first refusal in connection with our entry into the KP415 License Agreement.\nUnder our March 2012 termination agreement with Aquestive, Aquestive has the right to receive a royalty amount equal to 10% of any value generated by AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879, and any product candidates containing SDX, including royalty payments on any license of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879, the sale of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879 to a third party, the commercialization of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879 and the portion of any consideration that is attributable to the value of AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879 and paid to us or our stockholders in a change of control transaction. In connection with the KP415 License Agreement, we paid Aquestive a royalty equal to 10% of the upfront license payment we received in the third quarter of 2019 and the regulatory milestone payment we received in the second quarter of 2020.\nIn July 2020, we entered into the Corium Consulting Agreement under which Corium engaged us to guide the product development and regulatory activities for certain current and potential future products in their portfolio, as well as continue supporting preparation for the potential commercial launch of AZSTARYS. Under the Corium Consulting Agreement, we are entitled to receive payments from Corium of up to $15.6 million, $13.6 million of which will be paid in quarterly installments through March 31, 2022. The remaining $2.0 million is conditioned upon the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone related to Corium's product portfolio. Corium also agreed to be responsible for and reimburse us for all development, commercialization and regulatory expenses incurred as part of the performance of the consulting services.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of AZSTARYS, APADAZ or any of our other product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. We expect that our only source of revenues will be through payments arising from our license agreements with Commave and KVK, and through any other future arrangements related to one of our other product candidates. To date, we have generated revenue from the KP415 License Agreement in the form of the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million, of which we paid Aquestive $1.0 million as a royalty payment, a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA, of which we paid Aquestive $0.5 million as a royalty payment, reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs and payments related to the performance of consulting services. In addition, we have generated revenue under the Corium Consulting Agreement and other consulting arrangements for the performance of consulting services as well as reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party costs associated with those services. We cannot guarantee that either Commave or KVK will be able to successfully commercialize AZSTARYS or our product candidates covered under the KP415 License Agreement, or APADAZ, or that we will ever receive any payments under the KP415 License Agreement from commercial sales of APADAZ or any future payments under the APADAZ License Agreement. We also do not know when, if ever, any other product candidate will be commercially available.\nRoyalties and Contract Costs\nThe components of our royalties and contract costs are royalties and expenses directly attributable to revenue. To date, we have generated revenue from the KP415 License Agreement in the form of the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million, a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA, reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs and payments related to the performance of consulting services. In connection with the KP415 License Agreement, we paid Aquestive a royalty equal to 10% of the upfront license payment we received in the third quarter of 2019 and 10% of the regulatory milestone, related to the acceptance of the NDA, we received in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we capitalized incremental costs directly attributable to the KP415 License Agreement, these costs are amortized to royalties and contract costs as revenue is recognized.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into three categories: research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and severance expense. Salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, comprise a significant component of each of these expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with our facilities, information technology costs and depreciation and amortization between research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses based on employee headcount and the nature of work performed by each employee.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists of expenses incurred while performing research and development activities to discover and develop potential product candidates. This includes conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expense primarily consists of:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits and any stock-based compensation, for our scientific personnel performing research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> costs related to executing preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> fees paid to consultants and other third parties who support our product candidate development;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> other costs in seeking regulatory approval of our products; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> allocated facility-related costs and overhead.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outsourced development costs directly identified to programs:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AZSTARYS\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> KP484\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> APADAZ\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,866 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total outsourced development costs directly identified to programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,721 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development costs not directly identified to programs:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs including cash compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,204 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>599 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,891 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development costs not directly allocated to programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,415 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that our research and development expense will fluctuate for the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to advance the development of our product candidates, subject to the availability of additional funding. In accordance with the KP415 License Agreement, Commave has also agreed to be responsible and reimburse us for all of development, commercialization and regulatory expenses for the Licensed Product Candidates, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the KP415 License Agreement.\nThe successful commercialization of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our other product candidates that may be approved and the development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs required to commercialize AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other product candidates, if approved, and complete the remaining development of any product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the commercialization and development of our products and product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and any stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes personnel in executive, finance, human resources and administrative support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, consulting costs and costs of our information systems.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expense will fluctuate as we continue to operate as a public reporting company and continue to develop our product candidates. We believe that these fluctuations will likely include costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees for outside consultants, lawyers and accountants. We also expect to continue to incur costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations, disclosure and similar requirements applicable to public reporting companies.\nSeverance Expense\nSeverance expense in 2020 consisted of severance payments and stock-based compensation paid to our former chief business officer who ceased to serve in this role in February 2020. We had no severance expense in 2019.\nOther (Expense) Income\nOther (expense) income consists primarily of non-cash costs associated with fair value adjustments to our derivative and warrant liability and amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount to interest expense. Other (expense) income also includes interest expense incurred on our outstanding borrowings, as well as, interest and other income consisting primarily of interest earned on investments. These items are unrelated to our core business and thus are recognized as other (expense) income in our statements of operations.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit consists of refundable state income tax credits. To date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal or state income taxes because we have not generated taxable income. We have received state income tax credits related to our qualified research activities in Iowa.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Period-to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>449 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Royalty and direct contract acquisition costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,640 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,572 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,895 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>828 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,279 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,609 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,337 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,728 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense related to amortization of debt issuance costs and discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,305 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,656 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(649 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on principal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,785 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,858 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value adjustment related to derivative and warrant liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(184 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,182 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(220 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other (expense) income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,185 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,207 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,978 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,794 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,544 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,760 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,522 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,762 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $12.8 million, a decrease of $11.8 million compared to net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $24.5 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in loss from operations of $14.7 million, partially offset by a change in non-cash fair value adjustment from income of $2.0 million in 2019 to expense of $0.2 million in 2020, related to changes to the derivative and warrant liability, and an increase in net interest expense and other items of $0.8 million.\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $0.4 million, from $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting revenue of $5.3 million, primarily related to the Corium Consulting Agreement, and an increase in reimbursement revenue of $0.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in licensing and milestone revenue of $5.0 million, due to the one-time non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million received in 2019 compared to, the $5.0 million payment received related to the regulatory milestone in 2020 both pursuant to the KP415 License Agreement.\nRoyalties and Contract Costs\nRoyalties and contract costs decreased by $1.6 million, from $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in royalties due to Aquestive of $0.5 million related to the upfront and milestone payments we received in 2019 and 2020 discussed above and a decrease in the amortization of capitalized contract costs which were directly attributable to the revenue recognized of $1.1 million.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $10.6 million, from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net third-party research and development costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $2.9 million, from $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional fees and personnel-related costs.\nSeverance Expense\nSeverance expense of $0.8 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the termination of our chief business officer in February 2020. Severance expense is comprised of $0.4 million of personnel and other related charges and $0.4 million of stock compensation expense related to the acceleration of vesting on certain stock options upon employee termination. We had no severance expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther (Expense) Income\nOther expenses increased by $3.0 million, from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This period-to-period increase in expense was primarily attributable to a change in non-cash fair value adjustment from income of $2.0 million in 2019 to expense of $0.2 million in 2020 related to our derivative and warrant liability and an increase in net interest expense and other items of $0.8 million.\nComparison for Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nFor a discussion and analysis of changes in financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nThrough December 31, 2020, we have funded our research and development and operating activities primarily through the issuance of debt, private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial public offering, at-the-market offering, underwritten public offerings, through our purchase agreements with Lincoln Park Capital LLC, or Lincoln Park, and from revenue received under the KP415 License Agreement, the Corium Consulting Agreement and other consulting arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 million and restricted cash of $0.1 million.\nIn February 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement for an equity line of credit, or the 2019 ELOC Agreement, with Lincoln Park, which provided that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, we may sell to Lincoln Park up to $15.0 million of shares of our common stock, from time to time over the 36-month term of the 2019 ELOC Agreement, and upon execution of the 2019 ELOC Agreement we issued an additional 7,512 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares in accordance with the closing conditions contained within the 2019 ELOC Agreement. In February 2020, upon entering into a new purchase agreement for an equity line of credit, or the 2020 ELOC Agreement, with Lincoln Park, we terminated the 2019 ELOC Agreement. As a result, we will not make any future sales under the 2019 ELOC Agreement. Through the date of termination, we sold 212,579 shares of our common stock (exclusive of the 7,512 commitment shares) to Lincoln Park under the 2019 ELOC Agreement for approximately $5.4 million in gross proceeds.\nIn September 2019, we entered into the KP415 License Agreement with Commave and Commave paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million. In May 2020, the FDA accepted our NDA for AZSTARYS. Per the KP415 License Agreement, we received a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA's acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA. In July 2020, we entered into the Corium Consulting Agreement under which Corium engaged us to guide the product development and regulatory activities for certain current and potential future products in their portfolio, as well as continue supporting preparation for the potential commercial launch of AZSTARYS. Under the Corium Consulting Agreement, we are entitled to receive payments from Corium of up to $15.6 million, $13.6 million of which will be paid in quarterly installments through March 31, 2022. The remaining $2.0 million is conditioned upon the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone related to Corium's product portfolio. Corium also agreed to be responsible for and reimburse us for all development, commercialization and regulatory expenses incurred as part of the performance of the consulting services.\nIn February 2020, we entered into the 2020 ELOC Agreement, with Lincoln Park, which provided that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, we may sell to Lincoln Park up to $4.0 million of shares of our common stock, from time to time over the 12-month term of the 2020 ELOC Agreement, and upon execution of the 2020 ELOC Agreement we issued an additional 19,289 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares in accordance with the closing conditions contained within the 2020 ELOC Agreement. In May 2020, we reached the maximum allowable shares to be issued under the Current Registration Statement of 579,260 shares and therefore we cannot issue additional shares under the 2020 ELOC Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we have sold 559,971 shares of common stock (exclusive of the 19,289 commitment shares previously issued to Lincoln Park) under the 2020 ELOC Agreement for approximately $2.3 million in gross proceeds.\nWe have had recurring negative operating cash flows and, as of December 31, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $258.5 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur minimal positive net cash flows from operations or negative net cash flows from operations for at least the next several years. We expect that our sources of revenue will be through payments arising from our license agreements with Commave and KVK, or through our Corium Consulting Agreement, and other potential consulting arrangements and any other future arrangements related to one of our other product candidates.\nIn January 2021, we completed the Public Offering. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Public Offering, including from the exercises by the underwriter of its over-allotment option, totaled $52.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\nIn January 2021, we entered into the Inducement Letters. We received aggregate gross proceeds of $44.0 million from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Exercising Holders and the sale of the Inducement Warrants.\nOn April 23, 2020, we received proceeds of $0.8 million from a loan, or the PPP Loan, under the Paycheck Protection Program, or the PPP, of the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, a portion of which may be forgiven, which we used to retain current employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments. The PPP Loan matures on April 23, 2022 and bears annual interest at a rate of 1.0%. Payments of principal and interest on the PPP Loan are deferred for the first 16 months of the PPP Loan term. Thereafter, we could be required to pay the lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest.\nThe CARES Act and the PPP provide a mechanism for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed. Under the PPP, we may apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or part of the PPP Loan. The amount of loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness was originally based on a formula that takes into account a number of factors, including the amount of loan proceeds used by us during the 24-week period after the loan origination for certain purposes, including payroll costs, interest on certain mortgage obligations, rent payments on certain leases, and certain qualified utility payments, provided that at least 60% of the loan amount was used for eligible payroll costs. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on loan forgiveness, only loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered 24-week period qualify for forgiveness. We have applied for forgiveness under the provisions of the PPP loan and are awaiting a decision by the SBA.\nConvertible Debt\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $68.2 million of convertible notes outstanding, consisting of senior secured convertible promissory notes issued, under the Deerfield Facility Agreement with Deerfield. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we repaid in full the convertible notes and terminated the Deerfield Facility Agreement.\nDeerfield Facility Agreement\nIn June 2014, we entered into the Deerfield Facility Agreement as a $60.0 million multi-tranche credit facility with Deerfield. At the time we entered into the Deerfield Facility Agreement, we borrowed the first tranche, which consisted of a $15.0 million term note and the $10.0 million convertible note, or the Deerfield Convertible Note.\nThe Deerfield Convertible Note originally bore interest at 9.75% per annum, but was subsequently reduced to 6.75%. Interest accrued on the outstanding balance under the Deerfield Convertible Note was due quarterly in arrears. We originally had to repay one-third of the outstanding principal amount of the Deerfield Convertible Note on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Deerfield Facility Agreement (June 2018 and June 2019). In June 2018, Deerfield agreed to convert the $3,333,333 of the principal amount then due, plus $168,288 of accrued interest, into 37,410 shares of our common stock. In September 2019, we entered into an amendment with Deerfield in order to (i) reduce the interest rate applicable under the Deerfield Facility Agreement from 9.75% to 6.75%, (ii) provide for payment in kind\u201d of interest on the Loans (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement), and (iii) defer the Loan payments due pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement until June 1, 2020. In December 2019, we entered into another amendment with Deerfield in order to (i) defer the Loan payments due pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement until March 31, 2021 and (ii) allow for the entries of additional debt and debt holders under the Deerfield Facility Agreement (as discussed in more detail below).\nPursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement, we issued to Deerfield 1,923,077 shares of our Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, or Series D Preferred, as consideration for the loans provided to us thereunder. Upon closing of our initial public offering, these shares of Series D Preferred reclassified into 16,025 shares of our common stock.\nWe also issued to Deerfield the Deerfield Warrant to purchase 14,423,076 shares of our Series D Preferred at an initial exercise price of $0.78 per share, or the Deerfield Warrant. Upon closing of our initial public offering, this warrant converted into a warrant exercisable for 120,192 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $93.60 per share.\n2021 Notes\nIn February 2016, we issued our 5.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2021, or the 2021 Notes, in aggregate principal amount of $86.3 million. The 2021 Notes were originally issued to Cowen and Company and RBCCM LLC as representatives of the several initial purchasers, who subsequently resold the 2021 Notes to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act.\nThe 2021 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of February 9, 2016, or the indenture, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Interest on the 2021 Notes was payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2016, at a rate of 5.50% per year. The 2021 Notes originally matured on February 1, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased.\nAs described in more detail below, in multiple exchanges occurring in October 2018, December 2019 and January 2020, all outstanding 2021 Notes were exchanged by the holders thereof for either shares of our common stock or the December 2019 Notes and January 2020 Note issued under the terms of the Deerfield Facility Agreement.\n2021 Note Exchanges\n2021 Note Exchange Effected in October 2018\nIn October 2018, we entered into an exchange agreement, or the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, with the Deerfield Lenders. Under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, the Deerfield Lenders exchanged an aggregate of $9,577,000 principal amount of our 2021 Notes for an aggregate of 9,577 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001, or the Series A Preferred Stock.\nAs a condition to closing of the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, we filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series A Certificate of Designation, with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of our common stock at a price equal to $48.00 per share (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events). Immediately following the exchange under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, an aggregate of 3,192,333 shares of common stock were issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2020, all 9,577 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement have been converted into an aggregate 199,519 shares of our common stock.\n2021 Note Exchange Effected in September 2019\nIn September 2019, we entered into an Exchange Agreement and Amendment to Facility Agreement, or the September 2019 Exchange Agreement with the Deerfield Lenders. Under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 493,742 shares of our common stock and an aggregate of 1,576 shares of our Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, or the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, (such shares of common stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Initial Exchange Shares), in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $3,000,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes. The September 2019 Exchange Agreement provided the Deerfield Lenders the option to exchange up to an additional aggregate of $27,000,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, or the Optional Exchange Principal Amount, for shares of common stock or shares of our Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, or the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, and, together with the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, including limits as to the principal amount that can be exchanged prior to specified dates therein. If the Deerfield Lenders choose to exchange any portion of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount for shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock, such exchange will be effected at an exchange price of $1,000 per share. If the Deerfield Lenders choose to exchange any portion of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount for shares of common stock, such exchange will be effected at an exchange price equal to the greater of (i) $15.1904 or (ii) the average of the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange.\nAs a condition to closing of the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, we filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series B-1 Certificate of Designation, and a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation, with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively.\nEach share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a per share price equal to $15.1904 per share (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events). There was an aggregate of 103,749 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described below). Each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a per share price equal to the greater of (i) $15.1904 (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events), or (ii) the average of the volume-weighted average prices of the common stock on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange. Immediately following the exchange under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, there was an aggregate of 1,777,437 shares of Common Stock issuable (i) in exchange of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount, or (ii) upon conversion of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock issuable in exchange of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount (in each case without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described below).\nThe Series B Preferred Stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Deerfield Lenders; provided that the Deerfield Lenders are prohibited from converting shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of common stock if, as a result of such conversion, such holders (together with certain affiliates and group\u201d members of such holders) would beneficially own more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding. The Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemable. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Deerfield Lenders will receive an amount equal to $0.0001 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends, and thereafter will share ratably in any distribution of our assets with holders of common stock and with the holders of any shares of any other class or series of capital stock of us entitled to share in such remaining assets of us (including our Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. With respect to rights upon liquidation, the Series B Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock, on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, if any is outstanding, and junior to existing and future indebtedness. Except as otherwise required by law (or with respect to approval of certain actions involving our organizational documents that materially and adversely affect the holders of Series B Preferred Stock), the Series B Preferred Stock does not have voting rights. The Series B Preferred Stock is not subject to any price-based anti-dilution protections and does not provide for any accruing dividends, but provides that holders of Series B Preferred Stock will participate in any dividends on the common stock on an as-converted basis (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described above). The Series B-1 Certificate of Designation and the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation also provide for partial liquidated damages in the event that we fail to timely convert shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock or Series B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively, into common stock in accordance with the applicable Certificate of Designation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, all 1,576 shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock have been converted into 103,749 shares of common stock, and there were no shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock outstanding.\n2021 Note Exchange Effected in December 2019\nIn December 2019, we entered into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement and Amendment to Facility Agreement, Senior Secured Convertible Notes and Warrants, or the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, with the Deerfield Lenders and Delaware Street Capital Master Fund, L.P., or DSC and, collectively with the Deerfield Lenders, the December 2019 Holders. Under the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, we issued the December 2019 Notes as senior secured convertible promissory notes under the Deerfield Facility Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $71,418,011 in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $71,418,011 principal amount and accrued interest of the 2021 Notes. Upon entering into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, we agreed to pay the December 2019 Holders, in the aggregate, an interest payment of $745,011, which represents 50% of the accrued interest, as of December 18, 2019, on the 2021 Notes owned by the December 2019 Holders. The remainder of such interest was included in the principal amount of the December 2019 Notes.\nThe December 2019 Notes bear interest at 6.75% per annum. The December 2019 Notes were originally convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $17.11 per share (which represents the conversion price of the 2021 Notes), subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the December 2019 Notes. As of the date of issuance, the December 2019 Notes were convertible, by their terms, into an aggregate of 260,876 shares of our common stock. We subsequently amended the December 2019 Notes to provide that such notes shall be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $93.60 per share (which represents the conversion price of the Deerfield Convertible Note). The conversion price of the December 2019 Notes will be adjusted downward if we issue or sell any shares of common stock, convertible securities, warrants or options at a sale or exercise price per share less than the greater of the December 2019 Notes' conversion price or the closing sale price of our common stock on the last trading date immediately prior to such issuance, or, in the case of a firm commitment underwritten offering, on the date of execution of the underwriting agreement between us and"}
