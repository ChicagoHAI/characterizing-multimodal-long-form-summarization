Tennant is committed to creating and commercializing breakthrough, sustainable cleaning innovations to enhance its broad suite of products, including: floor maintenance and outdoor cleaning equipment, detergent-free and other sustainable cleaning technologies, aftermarket parts and consumables, equipment maintenance and repair service, specialty surface coatings and asset management solutions. Tennant products are used in many types of environments including: Retail establishments, distribution centers, factories and warehouses, public venues such as arenas and stadiums, office buildings, schools and universities, hospitals and clinics, parking lots and streets, and more. Customers include contract cleaners to whom organizations outsource facilities maintenance, as well as businesses that perform facilities maintenance themselves. The Company reaches these customers through the industry's largest direct sales and service organization and through a strong and well-supported network of authorized distributors worldwide.\nNet Sales in 2015 totaled $811.8 million, down from $822.0 million in the prior year primarily due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 5.5%, lower sales of outdoor equipment and sales declines to our Master Distributor for Russia. These impacts were partially offset by robust sales to strategic accounts in North America and global sales of new products and also selling list price increases. 2015 organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange (and acquisitions and divestitures when applicable), was up approximately 4.3% from 2014 with growth in the Americas and APAC geographical regions. 2015 Gross Profit margin increased 10 basis points to 43.0% from 42.9% in 2014 primarily due to improved operating efficiencies in both the direct service organization and manufacturing operations. This was somewhat offset by foreign currency headwinds that unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points. Selling and Administrative Expense ( S&A Expense\u201d) increased 0.5% from $250.9 million in 2014 to $252.3 million in 2015 primarily due to our 2015 third and fourth quarter restructuring charges, described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, of $3.7 million, or 50 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales. This was somewhat offset by continued cost controls and improved operating efficiencies that favorably impacted S&A Expense in 2015. Operating Profit of $53.2 million in 2015 was down from $72.1 million in the prior year and Operating Profit margin decreased 220 basis points to 6.6% in 2015 from 8.8% in 2014. Operating Profit during 2015 was unfavorably impacted by $14.9 million, or 180 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales, for the non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and the third and fourth quarter restructuring charges. Operating Profit was also unfavorably impacted by higher R&D Expense of $3.0 million as compared to 2014. Due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in 2015, foreign currency exchange reduced Operating Profit by approximately $13.0 million. Net Earnings for 2015 were unfavorably impacted by the $11.2 million pre-tax, or $0.58 per diluted share after-tax, non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as a result of the classification of our Green Machines assets as held for sale in the third quarter of 2015. There were also two restructuring charges included in the 2015 S&A Expense of $3.7 million pre-tax, or $0.17 per diluted share after-tax, to reduce our infrastructure costs.\nNet Earnings for 2014 were $10.4 million greater than 2013. The increase in net earnings resulted primarily from robust organic sales growth and a lower tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the mix in taxable earnings by country and favorable settlements on tax positions from prior years. 2014 Gross Profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 42.9% from 43.3% in 2013 primarily due to strong sales to strategic accounts and through distribution that tend to have lower gross margins and also costs related to hiring and training additional manufacturing employees to support higher levels of production. Net Sales in 2014 totaled $822.0 million, up from $752.0 million in the prior year primarily due to strong sales to strategic accounts and through distribution, continued demand for new products such as the T17 rider scrubber, gains in commercial, industrial and outdoor equipment and selling price increases. 2014 organic sales growth, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately 1.0%, was up approximately 10.3% with growth in all major geographical regions. S&A Expense increased 7.7%, but decreased 50 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales, from $233.0 million in 2013 to $250.9 million in 2014 primarily due to investments in direct sales, distribution and marketing to build organic sales. Operating Profit increased 15.5% and Operating Profit margin increased 50 basis points to 8.8% in 2014 from 8.3% in 2013 due to higher Net Sales and lower R&D Expense and S&A Expense, somewhat offset by lower Gross Margin, as a percentage of Net Sales.\nTennant continues to invest in innovative product development with 4.0% of 2015 Net Sales spent on R&D. During 2015, we continued to invest in developing innovative new products for our traditional core business, as well as in our Orbio Technologies Group, which is focused on advancing a suite of sustainable cleaning technologies. New products and technologies are a key driver of sales growth. 36 new products and product variants were launched in 2015, including new ergonomic backpack vacuum models, our next generation ec-H2O NanoClean\u2122 technology, the T300 family of walk-behind commercial floor scrubbers and our IRIS\u00ae Asset Manager onboard technologies to remotely track machine productivity and maintenance needs.\nWe ended 2015 with a Debt-to-Capital ratio of 8.9%, $51.3 million in Cash and Cash Equivalents compared to $93.0 million at the end of 2014, and Shareholders' Equity of $252.2 million. During 2015, we generated operating cash flows of $45.2 million, paid a total of $14.5 million in cash dividends and repurchased $46.0 million of common stock. Total debt was $24.7 million as of December 31, 2015, compared to $28.1 million at the end of 2014.\nHistorical Results\nThe following table compares the historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in dollars and as a percentage of Net Sales (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

The decrease was partially due to the $11.2 million non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets recorded in 2015 as a result of our decision to hold the assets and liabilities of our Green Machines outdoor city cleaning line for sale. We further describe this decision in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This impairment affects the results of operations in our EMEA region. In addition, Profit Before Income Taxes in our EMEA subsidiaries decreased by an additional $1.9 million as a result of two worldwide restructuring actions, which are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These restructuring actions also unfavorably impacted Profit Before Income Taxes in our APAC subsidiaries by an additional $0.7 million. Furthermore, Profit Before Income Taxes in our EMEA subsidiaries decreased by an additional $2.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a 15.6% decrease in Net Sales as a result of foreign exchange devaluations and the difficult economic conditions in the European region. Profit Before Income Taxes in our Latin America subsidiaries decreased by approximately $2.8 million in 2015 primarily due to a 26% decrease in net sales due to the devaluation of the Brazilian real and difficult economic conditions in the Latin American countries. Profit Before Income Taxes in our APAC subsidiaries increased by $1.3 million primarily due to lower intercompany interest expense as a result of new intercompany financing agreements and lower intercompany allocations as a result of a legal entity reorganization in 2014.\nProfit Before Income Taxes from foreign operations increased by $12.0 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was partially due to a $3.0 million restructuring charge recorded in 2013 as a result of two restructuring actions in our EMEA region, which were not present in 2014. Additionally, Profit Before Income Taxes in our EMEA subsidiaries increased by an additional $5.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a 5.4% increase in net sales, strong cost controls over S&A Expense and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Profit Before Income Taxes in our APAC region increased by approximately $3.1 million in 2014, primarily due to an 8.8% increase in Net Sales, strong cost controls over S&A Expense and lower foreign exchange losses.\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income Changes\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments - For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded pre-tax foreign currency translation losses of $12.5 million, $10.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income. These adjustments resulted from translating the financial statements of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into our reporting currency, which is the U.S. dollar, as well as other adjustments permitted by ASC 830 - Foreign Currency Matters.\nDuring 2015, we recorded translation losses of $6.5 million relating to the Brazilian real, $5.3 million for the Euro, $0.6 million for the Chinese renminbi and $0.1 million for various other currencies. These adjustments were caused by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these currencies of between 5% and 32% in 2015.\nDuring 2014, we recorded translation losses of $7.0 million relating to the Euro, $1.7 million for the Brazilian real, $1.1 million for the British pound and $0.3 million for various other currencies. These adjustments were caused by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these currencies of between 5% and 15% in 2014.\nDuring 2013, we recorded translation losses of $3.5 million relating to the Brazilian real, offset partially by translation gains of $0.7 million for the British pound, and translation gains for various other currencies of $0.6 million. The Brazilian real weakened by approximately 13% at the end of 2013, while the British pound strengthened slightly.\nPension and Retiree Medical Benefits - For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded pre-tax pension and postretirement liability adjustments consisting of gains of $4.1 million and losses of $5.4 million, respectively, in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income as further disclosed in Note 13 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a gain of $12.3 million in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income for these items.\nThe summarized changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for the three years ended December 31 were as follows:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net actuarial (gain) loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,940\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,351\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of prior service (cost) credit\n</td> <td>(67\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(37\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of net actuarial loss\n</td> <td>(1,114\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(512\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,961\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,282\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $4.1 million gain in 2015 was primarily due to a $2.9 million net actuarial gain relating to a decrease of $2.4 million in the projected benefit obligation resulting from a 32 basis point increase in the U.S. Pension discount rate, a 21 basis point increase in the non-U.S. discount rate and a 31 basis point increase in the postretirement discount rate. There was an approximate $3.3 million decrease in the pension benefit obligation in 2015 relating to demographic experience and other changes, as well as a $3.0 million increase due to a lower than expected actual return of assets. The net actuarial gain was supplemented by a $1.2 million credit relating to amortization of accumulated losses and prior service costs.\nThe $5.4 million loss in 2014 was primarily due to a $5.9 million net actuarial loss relating to an increase of $2.1 million in the projected benefit obligation from adopting a new mortality table in 2014, as well as an increase of $6.6 million in the projected benefit obligation resulting from an 87 basis point decease in the U.S. pension discount rate, a 95 basis point decrease in the non-U.S. discount rate and a 71 basis point decrease in the postretirement discount rate. There was an approximate $0.8 million decrease in the pension benefit obligation in 2014 relating to demographic experience and other changes, as well as a $2.0 million decrease due to higher than expected actual return on assets. The net actuarial loss was partially offset by a $0.5 million credit relating to amortization of accumulated actuarial losses and prior service costs.\nThe $12.3 million gain in 2013 was primarily due to a $10.4 million net actuarial gain relating to a $5.6 million decrease in the projected benefit obligation resulting from an 84 basis point increase in the U.S. pension discount rate, and an 83 basis point increase in the postretirement discount rate. There was an approximate $0.3 million increase in the pension benefit obligation in 2013 relating to demographic experience and other changes, as well as a $5.1 million decrease due to a higher than expected actual return on assets. The net actuarial gain was supplemented by a $1.9 million credit relating to amortization of accumulated actuarial losses and prior service costs.\nNet Sales\nIn 2015, consolidated Net Sales were $811.8 million, a decrease of 1.2% as compared to 2014. Consolidated Net Sales were $822.0 million in 2014, an increase of 9.3% as compared to 2013.\nThe components of the consolidated Net Sales change for 2015 as compared to 2014, and 2014 as compared to 2013, were as follows:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth Elements\n</td> <td>2015 v. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 v. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic Growth:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>3.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic Growth\n</td> <td>4.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign Currency\n</td> <td>(5.5%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>(1.2%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 1.2% decrease in consolidated Net Sales for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 5.5%, lower sales of outdoor equipment and sales declines to our Master Distributor in Russia. These impacts were partially offset by robust sales to strategic accounts in North America and global sales of new products, such as the T12 and T17 rider scrubbers and the T300 walk behind scrubber. Sales of new products introduced within the past three years totaled 26% of equipment revenue in 2015. The 1 percent price increase was the result of selling list price increases, typically in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent in most geographies, with an effective date of February 1, 2015.\nThe 9.3% increase in consolidated Net Sales for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to sales volume increases to strategic accounts and through distribution, continued demand for new products such as the T17 rider scrubber and gains in commercial, industrial and outdoor equipment.\nThe following table sets forth annual Net Sales by operating segment and the related percentage change from the prior year (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>591,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>569,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>514,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe, Middle East and Africa\n</td> <td>139,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>80,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>811,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>821,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>752,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmericas - In 2015, Americas Net Sales increased 3.9% to $591.4 million as compared with $569.0 million in 2014. The primary driver of the increase in Net Sales was attributable to robust sales to strategic accounts in North America and sales of newly introduced products, including the T12 and T17 rider scrubbers and the T300 walk behind scrubber. The direct impact of foreign currency translation exchange effects within the Americas unfavorably impacted Net Sales by approximately 2.5%. As a result, organic sales increased approximately 6.4% in 2015.\nIn 2014, Americas Net Sales increased 10.6% to $569.0 million as compared with $514.5 million in 2013. The primary driver of the increase in Net Sales was attributable to higher sales to strategic accounts, including sales of scrubbers in North America, scrubbers equipped with ec-H2O technology and walk-behind burnishers. Unfavorable direct foreign currency translation exchange effects decreased Net Sales by approximately 1.0%.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa - Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) Net Sales in 2015 decreased 15.6% to $139.8 million as compared to 2014 Net Sales of $165.7 million. Organic sales decreased approximately 2.1% in 2015, which reflected a fragile European economy resulting in lower sales of outdoor equipment and sales declines to our Master Distributor for Russia, somewhat offset by higher sales to strategic accounts and through distribution in Western Europe. Unfavorable direct foreign currency exchange effects decreased EMEA Net Sales by approximately 13.5% in 2015.\nEMEA Net Sales in 2014 increased 5.4% to $165.7 million as compared to 2013 Net Sales of $157.2 million. An organic sales increase of approximately 4.4% was primarily due to higher sales of outdoor equipment, including strong sales of 500ze lithium-ion battery-powered sweepers. Favorable direct foreign currency exchange effects increased EMEA Net Sales by approximately 1.0% in 2014.\nAsia Pacific - Asia Pacific Net Sales in 2015 decreased 7.7% to $80.6 million as compared to 2014 Net Sales of $87.3 million. Organic sales increased approximately 1.3% in 2015 due primarily to organic sales growth in China and Australia, more than offsetting the slower economy in other Asian countries. Unfavorable direct foreign currency exchange effects decreased Net Sales by approximately 9.0% in 2015.\nAsia Pacific Net Sales in 2014 increased 8.8% to $87.3 million as compared to 2013 Net Sales of $80.3 million. An organic sales increase of approximately 12.8% was primarily due to strong sales performance in China, Japan, Southeast Asia and Korea. Unfavorable direct foreign currency exchange effects decreased Net Sales by approximately 4.0% in 2014.\nGross Profit\nGross Profit margin was 43.0% in 2015, an increase of 10 basis points as compared to 2014. Gross Profit margin in 2015 was favorably impacted by operating efficiencies in both the direct service organization and manufacturing operations. This was somewhat offset by foreign currency headwinds that unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points.\nGross Profit margin was 42.9% in 2014, a decrease of 40 basis points as compared to 2013. Gross Profit margin in 2014 was unfavorably impacted by stronger sales to sales channels that tend to have lower gross margins and also costs related to hiring and training additional manufacturing employees and temporary workers to support the higher levels of production, including the continued ramp up to meet the growing demand for new products.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expense - R&D Expense increased $3.0 million, or 10.1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2015 R&D Expense increased 40 basis points to 4.0% in 2015 from 3.6% in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the number of R&D employees and the timing of new product development projects. We continued to invest in developing innovative new products and technologies.\nR&D Expense decreased $1.1 million, or 3.6%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2014 R&D Expense decreased 50 basis points to 3.6% in 2014 from 4.1% in the prior year primarily due to the timing of new product development projects. We continued to invest in developing innovative new products for our traditional core business, as well as our Orbio business.\nSelling and Administrative Expense - S&A Expense increased by $1.4 million, or 0.5%, in 2015 compared to 2014. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2015 S&A Expense increased 60 basis points to 31.1% from 30.5% in 2014 due to continued investments in direct sales and marketing to build organic sales. There were also two restructuring charges totaling $3.7 million, or 50 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales, to reduce our infrastructure costs. These were somewhat offset by strong cost controls and improved operating efficiencies that favorably impacted S&A Expense.\nS&A Expense increased by $17.9 million, or 7.7%, in 2014 compared to 2013. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2014 S&A Expense decreased 50 basis points to 30.5% from 31.0% in 2013 due to continued cost controls and improved operating efficiencies, somewhat offset by investments in direct sales, distribution and marketing to build organic sales that unfavorably impacted S&A Expense.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income - Interest Income was $0.2 million in 2015, a decrease of $0.1 million from 2014. The decrease between 2015 and 2014 was due to lower levels of cash deposits.\nInterest Income was $0.3 million in 2014, a decrease of $0.1 million from 2013. The decrease between 2014 and 2013 was due to decreases in interest rates on cash invested.\nInterest Expense - Interest Expense was $1.3 million in 2015 as compared to $1.7 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a lower level of debt.\nInterest Expense was $1.7 million in 2014 as compared to $1.8 million in 2013. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on long-term adjustable rate borrowings.\nNet Foreign Currency Transaction Losses - Net Foreign Currency Transaction Losses were $1.0 million in 2015 as compared to $0.7 million in 2014. The unfavorable change in the impact from foreign currency transactions in 2015 was due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates and settlements of transactional hedging activity in the normal course of business.\nNet Foreign Currency Transaction Losses were $0.7 million in 2014 and 2013.\nIncome Taxes\nThe overall effective income tax rate was 36.4%, 27.2% and 32.8% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe tax expense for 2015 included a $0.4 million tax benefit associated with an $11.2 million Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and a $0.6 million tax benefit associated with restructuring charges of $3.7 million. We are not able to recognize a tax benefit on the impairment charge until the assets are sold due to a tax valuation allowance. Excluding these items, the 2015 overall effective tax rate would have been 29.6%.\nThe increase in the 2015 overall effective tax rate as compared to the prior year, excluding the effect of the 2015 one-time charges, was primarily related to the mix in our full year taxable earnings by country.\nThere were no special items that affected the tax rate in 2014.\nThe tax expense for 2013 included a $0.1 million tax benefit associated with restructuring charges of $3.0 million. The tax expense also included a first quarter discrete tax benefit of $0.6 million for the enactment of the Federal R&D credit retroactively impacting the tax year ended December 31, 2012. Excluding these special items, the 2013 overall tax rate would have been 32.3%.\nWe do not have any plans to repatriate the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Any repatriation from foreign subsidiaries that would result in incremental U.S. taxation is not being considered. It is management's belief that reinvesting these earnings outside the U.S. is the most efficient use of capital.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity - Cash and Cash Equivalents totaled $51.3 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $93.0 million as of December 31, 2014. Cash and Cash Equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $14.9 million as of December 31, 2015, as compared to $15.8 million as of December 31, 2014. Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to provide working capital to subsidiaries as needed. Our current ratio was 2.2 as of December 31, 2015 and was 2.4 as of December 31, 2014, and our working capital was $160.4 million and $201.5 million, respectively.\nOur Debt-to-Capital ratio was 8.9% as of December 31, 2015, compared with 9.1% as of December 31, 2014. Our capital structure was comprised of $24.7 million of Debt and $252.2 million of Shareholders' Equity as of December 31, 2015.\nCash Flow Summary - Cash provided by (used in) our operating, investing and financing activities is summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing Activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net of Disposals\n</td> <td>(24,444\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,292\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions of Businesses, Net of Cash Acquired\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from Sale of Business\n</td> <td>1,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Increase) Decrease in Restricted Cash\n</td> <td>(322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(253\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing Activities\n</td> <td>(61,405\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,038\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,495\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash and Cash Equivalents\n</td> <td>(1,908\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (Decrease) Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,662\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities - Cash provided by operating activities was $45.2 million in 2015, $59.4 million in 2014 and $59.8 million in 2013. In 2015, cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by cash inflows resulting from $32.1 million of Net Earnings, which includes a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $11.2 million, and a decrease in Receivables, somewhat offset by a decrease in Accounts Payable and an increase in Inventories. The decrease in Receivables was the continued proactive management of our receivables by enforcing tighter credit limits and continuing to successfully collect past due balances.The increase in Inventories was in support of the launches of many new products. Cash provided by operating activities was $14.1 million lower in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower Net Earnings and a year over year increase in Inventories to support the launches of many new products.\nIn 2014, cash provided by operating activities was driven by $50.7 million of Net Earnings and increases in Accounts Payable somewhat offset by increases in Inventories and Receivables. The increase in Inventories was in support of higher sales levels and the launches of many new products. The increase in Receivables was due to higher sales levels, the variety of terms offered and mix of business. Cash provided by operating activities was $0.5 million lower in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to increases year over year in working capital to support the growth in sales.\nFor 2015, we used operating profit and operating profit margin as key indicators of financial performance and the primary metrics for performance-based incentives.\nTwo metrics used by management to evaluate how effectively we utilize our net assets are Accounts Receivable Days Sales Outstanding\u201d ( DSO\u201d) and Days Inventory on Hand\u201d ( DIOH\u201d), on a first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) basis. The metrics are calculated on a rolling three month basis in order to more readily reflect changing trends in the business. These metrics for the quarters ended December 31 were as follows (in days):\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DSO\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DIOH\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDSO decreased 1 day in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to the continued proactive management of our receivables by enforcing tighter credit limits and continuing to successfully collect past due balances having a larger favorable impact than the unfavorable trend in the variety of terms offered and mix of business.\nDIOH increased 5 days in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increased levels of inventory in support of higher sales levels and the launches of many new products somewhat offset by progress from inventory reduction initiatives.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash used for investing activities was $23.6 million in 2015, $17.9 million in 2014 and $11.4 million in 2013. Net capital expenditures were $24.4 million during 2015 as compared to $19.3 million in 2014 and $14.7 million in 2013. Our 2015 capital expenditures included investments in information technology process improvement projects, tooling related to new product development, and manufacturing equipment. Proceeds from Sale of Business provided $1.2 million in 2015, $1.4 million in 2014 and $4.3 million in 2013.\nCapital expenditures in 2014 and 2013 included investments in tooling related to new product development, and manufacturing and information technology process improvement projects.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used for financing activities was $61.4 million in 2015, $28.0 million in 2014 and $21.5 million in 2013. In 2015, the purchases of our common stock per our authorized repurchase program used $46.0 million, dividend payments used $14.5 million and the payment of Long-Term Debt used $3.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock of $1.7 million and the excess tax benefit on stock plans of $0.9 million. In 2014, payments of dividends used $14.5 million, payments of Long-Term Debt used $2.0 million and payments of Short-Term Debt used $1.5 million. In 2013, payments of dividends used $13.2 million and payments of Long-Term Debt used $1.1 million, partially offset by Short-Term Borrowings of $1.5 million. Our annual cash dividend payout increased for the 44th consecutive year to $0.80 per share in 2015, an increase of $0.02 per share over 2014.\nProceeds from the issuance of Common Stock generated $1.7 million in 2015, $2.3 million in 2014 and $8.3 million in 2013.\nOn June 22, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. At December 31, 2015, there were 641,523 remaining shares authorized for repurchase.\nThere were 764,046 shares repurchased in 2015 in the open market, 225,034 shares repurchased in 2014 and 434,118 shares repurchased during 2013, at average repurchase prices of $60.20 during 2015, $62.64 during 2014 and $51.04 during 2013. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank limits the payment of dividends and repurchases of stock to amounts ranging from $50.0 million to $75.0 million per fiscal year based on our leverage ratio after giving effect to such payments for the life of the agreement.\nIndebtedness - As of December 31, 2015, we had committed lines of credit totaling approximately $125.0 million and uncommitted lines of credit totaling approximately $87.2 million. There were $10.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our JPMorgan facility (described below) and $14.6 million in outstanding borrowings under our Prudential facility (described below) as of December 31, 2015. In addition, we had stand alone letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $3.2 million. Commitment fees on unused lines of credit for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $0.3 million.\nOur most restrictive covenants are part of our 2015 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as defined below), which are the same covenants in our Shelf Agreement (as defined below) with Prudential (as defined below), and require us to maintain an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio of not greater than 3.25 to 1 and to maintain an EBITDA to interest expense ratio of no less than 3.50 to 1 as of the end of each quarter. As of December 31, 2015, our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 0.37 to 1 and our EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 64.39 to 1.\nCredit Facilities\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association\nOn June 30, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\") that amended and restated the Credit Agreement dated May 5, 2011 between us and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The first payment of $2.0 million on Series A notes was made during the first quarter of 2014. The second payment of $2.0 million on Series A notes was made during the first quarter of 2015. The first payment of $1.4 million on Series B notes was made during the second quarter of 2015. We were in compliance with all covenants under this Shelf Agreement as of December 31, 2015.\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland Citizens, N.A.\nOn September 14, 2010, we entered into an overdraft facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland Citizens, N.A. in the amount of \u20ac2.0 million or approximately $2.2 million. There was no balance outstanding on this facility as of December 31, 2015.\nHSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch\nOn June 20, 2012, we entered into a banking facility with the HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch in the amount of $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings on this facility.\nCollateralized Borrowings\nCollateralized borrowings represent deferred sales proceeds on certain leasing transactions with third-party leasing companies. These transactions are accounted for as borrowings, with the related assets capitalized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated straight-line over the lease term.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nCapital lease obligations outstanding are primarily related to sale-leaseback transactions with third-party leasing companies whereby we sell our manufactured equipment to the leasing company and lease it back. The equipment covered by these leases is rented to our customers over the lease term.\nContractual Obligations - Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, are summarized by period due in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term\ndebt(1)\n</td> <td>2,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on capital leases\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement benefit plans(2)\n</td> <td>1,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation arrangements(3)\n</td> <td>7,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating\nleases(4)\n</td> <td>23,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(5)\n</td> <td>59,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(6)\n</td> <td>9,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Long-term debt represents borrowings through our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan and our Shelf Agreement with Prudential. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan does not have specified repayment terms; therefore, repayment is due upon expiration of the agreement on June 30, 2020. Interest payments on our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were calculated using the December 31, 2015 LIBOR rate based on the assumption that the principal would be repaid in full upon the expiration of the agreement. Our borrowings under our Shelf Agreement with Prudential have 7 and 10 year terms, with remaining serial maturities from 2016 to 2021 with fixed interest rates of 4.00% and 4.10%, respectively.\n(2)Our retirement benefit plans, as described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, require us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. Our plan obligations totaled $5.9 million as of December 31, 2015. Contributions to the various plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the market performance of plan assets, if any, and future changes in interest rates, which impact the actuarial measurement of plan obligations. As a result, we have only included our 2016 expected contribution in the contractual obligations table.\n(3)The unfunded deferred compensation arrangements covering certain current and retired management employees totaled $7.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Our estimated distributions in the contractual obligations table are based upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant distribution elections.\n(4)Operating lease commitments consist primarily of office and warehouse facilities, vehicles and office equipment as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(5)Purchase obligations include all known open purchase orders, contractual purchase commitments and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\n(6)Other obligations include residual value guarantees as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2.3 million and accrued interest and penalties of $0.5 million as of December 31, 2015. We expect to make cash outlays in the future related to uncertain tax positions. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNewly Issued Accounting Guidance\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU will replace all existing revenue recognition standards and significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. This guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. This guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year from the original effective date specified in ASU No. 2014-09. The guidance now permits us to apply the new revenue recognition standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, which is our fiscal 2018. The provisions of the ASU permit companies to adopt the new revenue standard early, but not before the original public organization effective date, which is for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which is our fiscal 2017.\nThe new standard may be adopted retrospectively for all periods presented, or adopted using a modified retrospective approach. Under the retrospective approach, the fiscal 2017 and 2016 financial statements would be adjusted to reflect the effects of applying the new standard on those periods. Under the modified retrospective approach, the new standard would only be applied for the period beginning January 1, 2018 to new contracts and those contracts that are not yet complete at January 1, 2018, with a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings for existing contracts that still require performance. Management is currently evaluating the methods of adoption allowed by the new standard and the effect the standard is expected to have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nSimplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The provisions of the ASU are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, which clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs from line-of-credit arrangements after the adoption of ASU 2015-03. In particular, ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of such arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nCustomer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Intangibles -Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. This amended guidance requires customers to determine whether or not an arrangement includes a software license element. If the arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The provisions of the ASU are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date; or retrospectively. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nSimplifying the Measurement of Inventory\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This amended guidance changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. The provisions of the ASU are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in the classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position and does not affect the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets be offset and presented as a single amount. The amendments in this Update are effective for our annual period beginning January 1, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.\nHowever, earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Thus, we have decided to early adopt ASU No. 2015-17 during the fourth quarter of 2015 and classify any deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the adoption of this ASU, including the method of transition and the overall impact on our financial position.\nNo other new accounting pronouncements issued during 2015 but not yet effective have had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts - We record a reserve for accounts receivable that are potentially uncollectible. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past-due balances. In order to assess the collectability of these receivables, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition. Through these evaluations, we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability, credit ratings or bankruptcy. The reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available. Our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to trade receivables. These percentages are determined by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, current economic trends, historical payment and bad debt write-off experience. We are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to these customers deteriorate, our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances. Alternatively, if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required, we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience. Bad debt write-offs as a percentage of Net Sales were approximately 0.2% in 2015, 0.1% in 2014 and 0.2% in 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we had $3.6 million reserved against Accounts Receivable for doubtful accounts and sales returns.\nInventory Reserves - We value our inventory at the lower of the cost of inventory or fair market value through the establishment of a reserve for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels. Reserve requirements are developed by comparing our inventory levels to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand, market conditions and technological and product life cycle changes. It is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there are significant declines in demand for certain products. This reserve creates a new cost basis for these products and is considered permanent. As of December 31, 2015, we had $3.5 million reserved against Inventories.\nGoodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and is allocated to our reporting units at the time of the acquisition. We analyze Goodwill on an annual basis and when an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of one of our reporting units below its carrying amount. A goodwill impairment loss occurs if the carrying amount of a reporting unit's Goodwill exceeds its fair value.\nWe performed an analysis of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the two-step model is used as an indicator to identify if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the first step indicates there may be an impairment, the second step is performed which measures the amount of the goodwill impairment, if any. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of year end and use our judgment to develop assumptions for the discounted cash flow model that we use, if necessary. Management assumptions include forecasting revenues and margins, estimating capital expenditures, depreciation, amortization and discount rates.\nIf our goodwill impairment testing resulted in one or more of our reporting units' carrying amount exceeding its fair value, we would write down our reporting units' carrying amount to its fair value and would record an impairment charge in our results of operations in the period such determination is made. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment charges is not permitted. Each of our reporting units were analyzed for impairment as of December 31, 2015 and based upon our analysis, the estimated fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts. We had Goodwill of $16.8 million as of December 31, 2015.\nWarranty Reserves - We record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale. The amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to net sales, the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim, new product introductions and other factors. Future claims experience could be materially different from prior results because of the introduction of new, more complex products, a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends, competition or other external forces, or manufacturing changes that could impact product quality. In the event we determine that our current or future product repair and replacement costs exceed our estimates, an adjustment to these reserves would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Warranty expense as a percentage of Net Sales was 1.4% in 2015, 1.3% in 2014 and 1.4% in 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we had $10.1 million reserved for future estimated warranty costs.\nIncome Taxes - We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions. We also establish reserves for uncertain tax matters that are complex in nature and uncertain as to the ultimate outcome. Although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we consider our ability to ultimately prevail in defending these matters when establishing these reserves. We adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. We believe that our current reserves are adequate. However, the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the income tax expense reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nTax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns, and some differences will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years but have already been recorded as an expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and, based on management's judgment, to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation reserve against those deferred tax assets. The deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be materially different from actual results because of changes in the mix of future taxable income, the relationship between book and taxable income and our tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2015, a valuation allowance of $5.9 million was recorded against foreign tax loss carryforwards, foreign tax credit carryforwards and state credit carryforwards.\nCautionary Factors Relevant to Forward-Looking Information\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 2, contain certain statements that are considered forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

second vehicle (Vehicle B) offers a more efficient fuel consumption, albeit with lower power and torque outputs\n- Additionally, Vehicle A outperforms Vehicle B in terms of pricing, making it a more cost-effective option\n- Nevertheless, Vehicle B holds an advantage in terms of warranty coverage, providing more extensive protection for the buyer\n\nIs there anything specific you would like to

manufacturing and marketing solutions that empower customers to achieve quality cleaning performance, significantly reduce environmental impact and help create a cleaner, safer, healthier world. Tennant is committed to creating and commercializing breakthrough, sustainable cleaning innovations to enhance its broad suite of products, including: floor maintenance and outdoor cleaning equipment, detergent-free and other sustainable cleaning technologies, aftermarket parts and consumables, equipment maintenance and repair service, specialty surface coatings and asset management solutions. Tennant products are used in many types of environments including: Retail establishments, distribution centers, factories and warehouses, public venues such as arenas and stadiums, office buildings, schools and universities, hospitals and clinics, parking lots and streets, and more. Customers include contract cleaners to whom organizations outsource facilities maintenance, as well as businesses that perform facilities maintenance themselves. The Company reaches these customers through the industry's largest direct sales and service organization and through a strong and well-supported network of authorized distributors worldwide.\nNet Sales in 2015 totaled $811.8 million, down from $822.0 million in the prior year primarily due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 5.5%, lower sales of outdoor equipment and sales declines to our Master Distributor for Russia. These impacts were partially offset by robust sales to strategic accounts in North America and global sales of new products and also selling list price increases. 2015 organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange (and acquisitions and divestitures when applicable), was up approximately 4.3% from 2014 with growth in the Americas and APAC geographical regions. 2015 Gross Profit margin increased 10 basis points to 43.0% from 42.9% in 2014 primarily due to improved operating efficiencies in both the direct service organization and manufacturing operations. This was somewhat offset by foreign currency headwinds that unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points. Selling and Administrative Expense ( S&A Expense\u201d) increased 0.5% from $250.9 million in 2014 to $252.3 million in 2015 primarily due to our 2015 third and fourth quarter restructuring charges, described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, of $3.7 million, or 50 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales. This was somewhat offset by continued cost controls and improved operating efficiencies that favorably impacted S&A Expense in 2015. Operating Profit of $53.2 million in 2015 was down from $72.1 million in the prior year and Operating Profit margin decreased 220 basis points to 6.6% in 2015 from 8.8% in 2014. Operating Profit during 2015 was unfavorably impacted by $14.9 million, or 180 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales, for the non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and the third and fourth quarter restructuring charges. Operating Profit was also unfavorably impacted by higher R&D Expense of $3.0 million as compared to 2014. Due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in 2015, foreign currency exchange reduced Operating Profit by approximately $13.0 million. Net Earnings for 2015 were unfavorably impacted by the $11.2 million pre-tax, or $0.58 per diluted share after-tax, non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as a result of the classification of our Green Machines assets as held for sale in the third quarter of 2015. There were also two restructuring charges included in the 2015 S&A Expense of $3.7 million pre-tax, or $0.17 per diluted share after-tax, to reduce our infrastructure costs.\nNet Earnings for 2014 were $10.4 million greater than 2013. The increase in net earnings resulted primarily from robust organic sales growth and a lower tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the mix in taxable earnings by country and favorable settlements on tax positions from prior years. 2014 Gross Profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 42.9% from 43.3% in 2013 primarily due to strong sales to strategic accounts and through distribution that tend to have lower gross margins and also costs related to hiring and training additional manufacturing employees to support higher levels of production. Net Sales in 2014 totaled $822.0 million, up from $752.0 million in the prior year primarily due to strong sales to strategic accounts and through distribution, continued demand for new products such as the T17 rider scrubber, gains in commercial, industrial and outdoor equipment and selling price increases. 2014 organic sales growth, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately 1.0%, was up approximately 10.3% with growth in all major geographical regions. S&A Expense increased 7.7%, but decreased 50 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales, from $233.0 million in 2013 to $250.9 million in 2014 primarily due to investments in direct sales, distribution and marketing to build organic sales. Operating Profit increased 15.5% and Operating Profit margin increased 50 basis points to 8.8% in 2014 from 8.3% in 2013 due to higher Net Sales and lower R&D Expense and S&A Expense, somewhat offset by lower Gross Margin, as a percentage of Net Sales.\nTennant continues to invest in innovative product development with 4.0% of 2015 Net Sales spent on R&D. During 2015, we continued to invest in developing innovative new products for our traditional core business, as well as in our Orbio Technologies Group, which is focused on advancing a suite of sustainable cleaning technologies. New products and technologies are a key driver of sales growth. 36 new products and product variants were launched in 2015, including new ergonomic backpack vacuum models, our next generation ec-H2O NanoClean\u2122 technology, the T300 family of walk-behind commercial floor scrubbers and our IRIS\u00ae Asset Manager onboard technologies to remotely track machine productivity and maintenance needs.\nWe ended 2015 with a Debt-to-Capital ratio of 8.9%, $51.3 million in Cash and Cash Equivalents compared to $93.0 million at the end of 2014, and Shareholders' Equity of $252.2 million. During 2015, we generated operating cash flows of $45.2 million, paid a total of $14.5 million in cash dividends and repurchased $46.0 million of common stock. Total debt was $24.7 million as of December 31, 2015, compared to $28.1 million at the end of 2014.\nHistorical Results\nThe following table compares the historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in dollars and as a percentage of Net Sales (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\n\nConsolidated Financial Results\nNet Earnings for 2015 were $32.1 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, compared to $50.7 million, or $2.70 per diluted share for 2014. Net Earnings were impacted by:\n \u2022 A decrease in Net Sales of 1.2% primarily due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 5.5%, lower sales of outdoor equipment and sales declines to our Master Distributor for Russia. These impacts were partially offset by robust sales to strategic accounts in North America and global sales of new products, such as the T12 and T17 rider scrubbers and the T300 walk behind scrubber, and also selling list price increases. \n \u2022 A 10 basis point increase in Gross Profit margin due to improved operating efficiencies in both the direct service organization and manufacturing operations, somewhat offset by foreign currency headwinds that unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points. \n \u2022 An increase in S&A Expense as a percentage of Net Sales of 60 basis points primarily due to our 2015 third and fourth quarter restructuring charges, described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This was somewhat offset by continued cost controls and improved operating efficiencies that favorably impacted S&A Expense. \n \u2022 An unfavorable impact of 130 basis points, as a percentage of Net Sales, net of tax, for the non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. \n \u2022 An unfavorable direct foreign currency exchange impact to Net Earnings of 110 basis points, as a percentage of Net Sales.  Net Earnings for 2014 were $50.7 million, or $2.70 per diluted share, compared to $40.2 million, or $2.14 per diluted share for 2013. Net Earnings were impacted by:\n \u2022 An increase in Net Sales of 9.3%, primarily due to increased sales to strategic accounts and through distribution, continued demand for new products, gains in commercial, industrial and outdoor equipment, and selling list price increases, typically in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent in most geographies, in March 2014. \n \u2022 A 40 basis point decrease in Gross Profit margin due to strong sales to strategic accounts and through distribution that tend to have lower gross profit margins and also costs related to hiring and training additional manufacturing employees to support the higher levels of production. \n \u2022 A decrease in S&A Expense as a percentage of Net Sales of 50 basis points due to continued cost controls and improved operating efficiencies, somewhat offset by investments in direct sales, distribution and marketing to build organic sales.  Profit Before Income Taxes for 2015 was $50.4 million compared to $69.5 million for 2014 and $59.9 million in 2013.\nThe breakdown of Profit Before Income Taxes between U.S. and foreign operations for each year ended December 31 were as follows:\n\nProfit Before Income Taxes from foreign operations decreased by $18.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was partially due to the $11.2 million non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets recorded in 2015 as a result of our decision to hold the assets and liabilities of our Green Machines outdoor city cleaning line for sale. We further describe this decision in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This impairment affects the results of operations in our EMEA region. In addition, Profit Before Income Taxes in our EMEA subsidiaries decreased by an additional $1.9 million as a result of two worldwide restructuring actions, which are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These restructuring actions also unfavorably impacted Profit Before Income Taxes in our APAC subsidiaries by an additional $0.7 million. Furthermore, Profit Before Income Taxes in our EMEA subsidiaries decreased by an additional $2.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a 15.6% decrease in Net Sales as a result of foreign exchange devaluations and the difficult economic conditions in the European region. Profit Before Income Taxes in our Latin America subsidiaries decreased by approximately $2.8 million in 2015 primarily due to a 26% decrease in net sales due to the devaluation of the Brazilian real and difficult economic conditions in the Latin American countries. Profit Before Income Taxes in our APAC subsidiaries increased by $1.3 million primarily due to lower intercompany interest expense as a result of new intercompany financing agreements and lower intercompany allocations as a result of a legal entity reorganization in 2014.\nProfit Before Income Taxes from foreign operations increased by $12.0 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was partially due to a $3.0 million restructuring charge recorded in 2013 as a result of two restructuring actions in our EMEA region, which were not present in 2014. Additionally, Profit Before Income Taxes in our EMEA subsidiaries increased by an additional $5.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a 5.4% increase in net sales, strong cost controls over S&A Expense and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Profit Before Income Taxes in our APAC region increased by approximately $3.1 million in 2014, primarily due to an 8.8% increase in Net Sales, strong cost controls over S&A Expense and lower foreign exchange losses.\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income Changes\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments - For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded pre-tax foreign currency translation losses of $12.5 million, $10.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income. These adjustments resulted from translating the financial statements of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into our reporting currency, which is the U.S. dollar, as well as other adjustments permitted by ASC 830 - Foreign Currency Matters.\nDuring 2015, we recorded translation losses of $6.5 million relating to the Brazilian real, $5.3 million for the Euro, $0.6 million for the Chinese renminbi and $0.1 million for various other currencies. These adjustments were caused by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these currencies of between 5% and 32% in 2015.\nDuring 2014, we recorded translation losses of $7.0 million relating to the Euro, $1.7 million for the Brazilian real, $1.1 million for the British pound and $0.3 million for various other currencies. These adjustments were caused by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these currencies of between 5% and 15% in 2014.\nDuring 2013, we recorded translation losses of $3.5 million relating to the Brazilian real, offset partially by translation gains of $0.7 million for the British pound, and translation gains for various other currencies of $0.6 million. The Brazilian real weakened by approximately 13% at the end of 2013, while the British pound strengthened slightly.\nPension and Retiree Medical Benefits - For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded pre-tax pension and postretirement liability adjustments consisting of gains of $4.1 million and losses of $5.4 million, respectively, in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income as further disclosed in Note 13 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a gain of $12.3 million in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income for these items.\nThe summarized changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for the three years ended December 31 were as follows:\n\nThe $4.1 million gain in 2015 was primarily due to a $2.9 million net actuarial gain relating to a decrease of $2.4 million in the projected benefit obligation resulting from a 32 basis point increase in the U.S. Pension discount rate, a 21 basis point increase in the non-U.S. discount rate and a 31 basis point increase in the postretirement discount rate. There was an approximate $3.3 million decrease in the pension benefit obligation in 2015 relating to demographic experience and other changes, as well as a $3.0 million increase due to a lower than expected actual return of assets. The net actuarial gain was supplemented by a $1.2 million credit relating to amortization of accumulated losses and prior service costs.\nThe $5.4 million loss in 2014 was primarily due to a $5.9 million net actuarial loss relating to an increase of $2.1 million in the projected benefit obligation from adopting a new mortality table in 2014, as well as an increase of $6.6 million in the projected benefit obligation resulting from an 87 basis point decease in the U.S. pension discount rate, a 95 basis point decrease in the non-U.S. discount rate and a 71 basis point decrease in the postretirement discount rate. There was an approximate $0.8 million decrease in the pension benefit obligation in 2014 relating to demographic experience and other changes, as well as a $2.0 million decrease due to higher than expected actual return on assets. The net actuarial loss was partially offset by a $0.5 million credit relating to amortization of accumulated actuarial losses and prior service costs.\nThe $12.3 million gain in 2013 was primarily due to a $10.4 million net actuarial gain relating to a $5.6 million decrease in the projected benefit obligation resulting from an 84 basis point increase in the U.S. pension discount rate, and an 83 basis point increase in the postretirement discount rate. There was an approximate $0.3 million increase in the pension benefit obligation in 2013 relating to demographic experience and other changes, as well as a $5.1 million decrease due to a higher than expected actual return on assets. The net actuarial gain was supplemented by a $1.9 million credit relating to amortization of accumulated actuarial losses and prior service costs.\nNet Sales\nIn 2015, consolidated Net Sales were $811.8 million, a decrease of 1.2% as compared to 2014. Consolidated Net Sales were $822.0 million in 2014, an increase of 9.3% as compared to 2013.\nThe components of the consolidated Net Sales change for 2015 as compared to 2014, and 2014 as compared to 2013, were as follows:\n\nThe 1.2% decrease in consolidated Net Sales for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 5.5%, lower sales of outdoor equipment and sales declines to our Master Distributor in Russia. These impacts were partially offset by robust sales to strategic accounts in North America and global sales of new products, such as the T12 and T17 rider scrubbers and the T300 walk behind scrubber. Sales of new products introduced within the past three years totaled 26% of equipment revenue in 2015. The 1 percent price increase was the result of selling list price increases, typically in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent in most geographies, with an effective date of February 1, 2015.\nThe 9.3% increase in consolidated Net Sales for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to sales volume increases to strategic accounts and through distribution, continued demand for new products such as the T17 rider scrubber and gains in commercial, industrial and outdoor equipment.\nThe following table sets forth annual Net Sales by operating segment and the related percentage change from the prior year (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nAmericas - In 2015, Americas Net Sales increased 3.9% to $591.4 million as compared with $569.0 million in 2014. The primary driver of the increase in Net Sales was attributable to robust sales to strategic accounts in North America and sales of newly introduced products, including the T12 and T17 rider scrubbers and the T300 walk behind scrubber. The direct impact of foreign currency translation exchange effects within the Americas unfavorably impacted Net Sales by approximately 2.5%. As a result, organic sales increased approximately 6.4% in 2015.\nIn 2014, Americas Net Sales increased 10.6% to $569.0 million as compared with $514.5 million in 2013. The primary driver of the increase in Net Sales was attributable to higher sales to strategic accounts, including sales of scrubbers in North America, scrubbers equipped with ec-H2O technology and walk-behind burnishers. Unfavorable direct foreign currency translation exchange effects decreased Net Sales by approximately 1.0%.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa - Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) Net Sales in 2015 decreased 15.6% to $139.8 million as compared to 2014 Net Sales of $165.7 million. Organic sales decreased approximately 2.1% in 2015, which reflected a fragile European economy resulting in lower sales of outdoor equipment and sales declines to our Master Distributor for Russia, somewhat offset by higher sales to strategic accounts and through distribution in Western Europe. Unfavorable direct foreign currency exchange effects decreased EMEA Net Sales by approximately 13.5% in 2015.\nEMEA Net Sales in 2014 increased 5.4% to $165.7 million as compared to 2013 Net Sales of $157.2 million. An organic sales increase of approximately 4.4% was primarily due to higher sales of outdoor equipment, including strong sales of 500ze lithium-ion battery-powered sweepers. Favorable direct foreign currency exchange effects increased EMEA Net Sales by approximately 1.0% in 2014.\nAsia Pacific - Asia Pacific Net Sales in 2015 decreased 7.7% to $80.6 million as compared to 2014 Net Sales of $87.3 million. Organic sales increased approximately 1.3% in 2015 due primarily to organic sales growth in China and Australia, more than offsetting the slower economy in other Asian countries. Unfavorable direct foreign currency exchange effects decreased Net Sales by approximately 9.0% in 2015.\nAsia Pacific Net Sales in 2014 increased 8.8% to $87.3 million as compared to 2013 Net Sales of $80.3 million. An organic sales increase of approximately 12.8% was primarily due to strong sales performance in China, Japan, Southeast Asia and Korea. Unfavorable direct foreign currency exchange effects decreased Net Sales by approximately 4.0% in 2014.\nGross Profit\nGross Profit margin was 43.0% in 2015, an increase of 10 basis points as compared to 2014. Gross Profit margin in 2015 was favorably impacted by operating efficiencies in both the direct service organization and manufacturing operations. This was somewhat offset by foreign currency headwinds that unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points.\nGross Profit margin was 42.9% in 2014, a decrease of 40 basis points as compared to 2013. Gross Profit margin in 2014 was unfavorably impacted by stronger sales to sales channels that tend to have lower gross margins and also costs related to hiring and training additional manufacturing employees and temporary workers to support the higher levels of production, including the continued ramp up to meet the growing demand for new products.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expense - R&D Expense increased $3.0 million, or 10.1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2015 R&D Expense increased 40 basis points to 4.0% in 2015 from 3.6% in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the number of R&D employees and the timing of new product development projects. We continued to invest in developing innovative new products and technologies.\nR&D Expense decreased $1.1 million, or 3.6%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2014 R&D Expense decreased 50 basis points to 3.6% in 2014 from 4.1% in the prior year primarily due to the timing of new product development projects. We continued to invest in developing innovative new products for our traditional core business, as well as our Orbio business.\nSelling and Administrative Expense - S&A Expense increased by $1.4 million, or 0.5%, in 2015 compared to 2014. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2015 S&A Expense increased 60 basis points to 31.1% from 30.5% in 2014 due to continued investments in direct sales and marketing to build organic sales. There were also two restructuring charges totaling $3.7 million, or 50 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales, to reduce our infrastructure costs. These were somewhat offset by strong cost controls and improved operating efficiencies that favorably impacted S&A Expense.\nS&A Expense increased by $17.9 million, or 7.7%, in 2014 compared to 2013. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2014 S&A Expense decreased 50 basis points to 30.5% from 31.0% in 2013 due to continued cost controls and improved operating efficiencies, somewhat offset by investments in direct sales, distribution and marketing to build organic sales that unfavorably impacted S&A Expense.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income - Interest Income was $0.2 million in 2015, a decrease of $0.1 million from 2014. The decrease between 2015 and 2014 was due to lower levels of cash deposits.\nInterest Income was $0.3 million in 2014, a decrease of $0.1 million from 2013. The decrease between 2014 and 2013 was due to decreases in interest rates on cash invested.\nInterest Expense - Interest Expense was $1.3 million in 2015 as compared to $1.7 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a lower level of debt.\nInterest Expense was $1.7 million in 2014 as compared to $1.8 million in 2013. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on long-term adjustable rate borrowings.\nNet Foreign Currency Transaction Losses - Net Foreign Currency Transaction Losses were $1.0 million in 2015 as compared to $0.7 million in 2014. The unfavorable change in the impact from foreign currency transactions in 2015 was due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates and settlements of transactional hedging activity in the normal course of business.\nNet Foreign Currency Transaction Losses were $0.7 million in 2014 and 2013.\nIncome Taxes\nThe overall effective income tax rate was 36.4%, 27.2% and 32.8% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe tax expense for 2015 included a $0.4 million tax benefit associated with an $11.2 million Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and a $0.6 million tax benefit associated with restructuring charges of $3.7 million. We are not able to recognize a tax benefit on the impairment charge until the assets are sold due to a tax valuation allowance. Excluding these items, the 2015 overall effective tax rate would have been 29.6%.\nThe increase in the 2015 overall effective tax rate as compared to the prior year, excluding the effect of the 2015 one-time charges, was primarily related to the mix in our full year taxable earnings by country.\nThere were no special items that affected the tax rate in 2014.\nThe tax expense for 2013 included a $0.1 million tax benefit associated with restructuring charges of $3.0 million. The tax expense also included a first quarter discrete tax benefit of $0.6 million for the enactment of the Federal R&D credit retroactively impacting the tax year ended December 31, 2012. Excluding these special items, the 2013 overall tax rate would have been 32.3%.\nWe do not have any plans to repatriate the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Any repatriation from foreign subsidiaries that would result in incremental U.S. taxation is not being considered. It is management's belief that reinvesting these earnings outside the U.S. is the most efficient use of capital.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity - Cash and Cash Equivalents totaled $51.3 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $93.0 million as of December 31, 2014. Cash and Cash Equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $14.9 million as of December 31, 2015, as compared to $15.8 million as of December 31, 2014. Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to provide working capital to subsidiaries as needed. Our current ratio was 2.2 as of December 31, 2015 and was 2.4 as of December 31, 2014, and our working capital was $160.4 million and $201.5 million, respectively.\nOur Debt-to-Capital ratio was 8.9% as of December 31, 2015, compared with 9.1% as of December 31, 2014. Our capital structure was comprised of $24.7 million of Debt and $252.2 million of Shareholders' Equity as of December 31, 2015.\nCash Flow Summary - Cash provided by (used in) our operating, investing and financing activities is summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities - Cash provided by operating activities was $45.2 million in 2015, $59.4 million in 2014 and $59.8 million in 2013. In 2015, cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by cash inflows resulting from $32.1 million of Net Earnings, which includes a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $11.2 million, and a decrease in Receivables, somewhat offset by a decrease in Accounts Payable and an increase in Inventories. The decrease in Receivables was the continued proactive management of our receivables by enforcing tighter credit limits and continuing to successfully collect past due balances.The increase in Inventories was in support of the launches of many new products. Cash provided by operating activities was $14.1 million lower in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower Net Earnings and a year over year increase in Inventories to support the launches of many new products.\nIn 2014, cash provided by operating activities was driven by $50.7 million of Net Earnings and increases in Accounts Payable somewhat offset by increases in Inventories and Receivables. The increase in Inventories was in support of higher sales levels and the launches of many new products. The increase in Receivables was due to higher sales levels, the variety of terms offered and mix of business. Cash provided by operating activities was $0.5 million lower in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to increases year over year in working capital to support the growth in sales.\nFor 2015, we used operating profit and operating profit margin as key indicators of financial performance and the primary metrics for performance-based incentives.\nTwo metrics used by management to evaluate how effectively we utilize our net assets are Accounts Receivable Days Sales Outstanding\u201d ( DSO\u201d) and Days Inventory on Hand\u201d ( DIOH\u201d), on a first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) basis. The metrics are calculated on a rolling three month basis in order to more readily reflect changing trends in the business. These metrics for the quarters ended December 31 were as follows (in days):\n\nDSO decreased 1 day in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to the continued proactive management of our receivables by enforcing tighter credit limits and continuing to successfully collect past due balances having a larger favorable impact than the unfavorable trend in the variety of terms offered and mix of business.\nDIOH increased 5 days in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increased levels of inventory in support of higher sales levels and the launches of many new products somewhat offset by progress from inventory reduction initiatives.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash used for investing activities was $23.6 million in 2015, $17.9 million in 2014 and $11.4 million in 2013. Net capital expenditures were $24.4 million during 2015 as compared to $19.3 million in 2014 and $14.7 million in 2013. Our 2015 capital expenditures included investments in information technology process improvement projects, tooling related to new product development, and manufacturing equipment. Proceeds from Sale of Business provided $1.2 million in 2015, $1.4 million in 2014 and $4.3 million in 2013.\nCapital expenditures in 2014 and 2013 included investments in tooling related to new product development, and manufacturing and information technology process improvement projects.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used for financing activities was $61.4 million in 2015, $28.0 million in 2014 and $21.5 million in 2013. In 2015, the purchases of our common stock per our authorized repurchase program used $46.0 million, dividend payments used $14.5 million and the payment of Long-Term Debt used $3.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock of $1.7 million and the excess tax benefit on stock plans of $0.9 million. In 2014, payments of dividends used $14.5 million, payments of Long-Term Debt used $2.0 million and payments of Short-Term Debt used $1.5 million. In 2013, payments of dividends used $13.2 million and payments of Long-Term Debt used $1.1 million, partially offset by Short-Term Borrowings of $1.5 million. Our annual cash dividend payout increased for the 44th consecutive year to $0.80 per share in 2015, an increase of $0.02 per share over 2014.\nProceeds from the issuance of Common Stock generated $1.7 million in 2015, $2.3 million in 2014 and $8.3 million in 2013.\nOn June 22, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. At December 31, 2015, there were 641,523 remaining shares authorized for repurchase.\nThere were 764,046 shares repurchased in 2015 in the open market, 225,034 shares repurchased in 2014 and 434,118 shares repurchased during 2013, at average repurchase prices of $60.20 during 2015, $62.64 during 2014 and $51.04 during 2013. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank limits the payment of dividends and repurchases of stock to amounts ranging from $50.0 million to $75.0 million per fiscal year based on our leverage ratio after giving effect to such payments for the life of the agreement.\nIndebtedness - As of December 31, 2015, we had committed lines of credit totaling approximately $125.0 million and uncommitted lines of credit totaling approximately $87.2 million. There were $10.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our JPMorgan facility (described below) and $14.6 million in outstanding borrowings under our Prudential facility (described below) as of December 31, 2015. In addition, we had stand alone letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $3.2 million. Commitment fees on unused lines of credit for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $0.3 million.\nOur most restrictive covenants are part of our 2015 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as defined below), which are the same covenants in our Shelf Agreement (as defined below) with Prudential (as defined below), and require us to maintain an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio of not greater than 3.25 to 1 and to maintain an EBITDA to interest expense ratio of no less than 3.50 to 1 as of the end of each quarter. As of December 31, 2015, our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 0.37 to 1 and our EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 64.39 to 1.\nCredit Facilities\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association\nOn June 30, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\") that amended and restated the Credit Agreement dated May 5, 2011 between us and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPMorgan\"), as administrative agent and collateral agent, U.S. Bank National Association, as syndication agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and RBS Citizens, N.A., as co-documentation agents, and the Lenders (including JPMorgan) from time to time party thereto, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated April 25, 2013 (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides us and certain of our foreign subsidiaries access to a senior unsecured credit facility until June 30, 2020, in the amount of $125.0 million, with an option to expand by up to $62.5 million to a total of $187.5 million. Borrowings may be denominated in U.S. dollars or certain other currencies.

The ABR borrowings bear interest under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the adjusted LIBOR rate for a one month period plus 1.00%, plus, in any such case, an additional spread of 0.075% to 0.700%, depending on our leverage ratio.  The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement gives the Lenders a pledge of 65% of the stock of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries. The obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are also guaranteed by certain of our first tier domestic subsidiaries.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting our ability to incur indebtedness and liens and merge or consolidate with another entity. It also incorporates new or recently revised financial regulations and other compliance matters. Further, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains the following covenants:\n \u2022 a covenant requiring us to maintain an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio as of the end of each quarter of not greater than 3.25 to 1. Under the Credit Agreement, the required indebtedness to EBITDA ratio as of the end of each quarter was not greater than 3.00 to 1; \n \u2022 a covenant requiring us to maintain an EBITDA to interest expense ratio as of the end of each quarter of no less than 3.50 to 1; \n \u2022 a covenant restricting us from paying dividends or repurchasing stock if, after giving effect to such payments, our leverage ratio is greater than 2.00 to 1, in such case limiting such payments to an amount ranging from $50.0 million to $75.0 million during any fiscal year based on our leverage ratio after giving effect to such payments; \n \u2022 a covenant restricting us from paying any dividends or repurchasing stock, if, after giving effect to such payments, our leverage ratio is greater than 3.25 to 1; and \n \u2022 a covenant restricting our ability to make acquisitions, if, after giving pro-forma effect to such acquisitions, our leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1, in such case limiting acquisitions to $25.0 million. Under the Credit Agreement, our leverage ratio restriction under this covenant was 2.75 to 1.  A copy of the full terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are incorporated by reference in Item 15 to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 7, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under this Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. There were $10.0 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2015, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.29%.\nPrudential Investment Management, Inc.\nOn July 29, 2009, we entered into a Private Shelf Agreement (the Shelf Agreement\u201d) with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. ( Prudential\u201d) and Prudential affiliates from time to time party thereto. The Shelf Agreement provides us and our subsidiaries access to an uncommitted, senior secured, maximum aggregate principal amount of $80.0 million of debt capital. The Shelf Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting our ability to incur indebtedness and liens and to merge or consolidate with another entity.\nA copy of the full terms and conditions of the Shelf Agreement are incorporated by reference in Item 15 to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 30, 2009.\nOn May 5, 2011, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to our Private Shelf Agreement (the Amendment\u201d).\nThe Amendment principally provided the following changes to the Shelf Agreement:\n \u2022 elimination of the security interest in our personal property and subsidiaries; and \n \u2022 an amendment to our restriction regarding the payment of dividends or repurchase of stock to restrict us from paying dividends or repurchasing stock if, after giving effect to such payments, our leverage ratio is greater than 2.00 to 1, in such case limiting such payments to an amount ranging from $50.0 million to $75.0 million during any fiscal year based on our leverage ratio after giving effect to such payments.  A copy of the full terms and conditions of the Amendment are incorporated by reference in Item 15 to Exhibit 10.2 to the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.\nOn July 24, 2012, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to our Private Shelf Agreement ( Amendment No. 2\u201d), which amended the Shelf Agreement. The principal change effected by Amendment No. 2 was an extension of the Issuance Period for Shelf Notes under the Shelf Agreement.\nA copy of the full terms and conditions of Amendment No. 2 are incorporated by reference in Item 15 to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 26, 2012.\nOn June 30, 2015, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to our Private Shelf Agreement (\"Amendment No. 3\"), which amends the Shelf Agreement by and among the Company, Prudential and Prudential affiliates from time to time party thereto, as amended by Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2.\nAmendment No. 3 principally provided the following changes to the Shelf Agreement:\n \u2022 extended the Issuance Period to June 30, 2018 from July 24, 2015; \n \u2022 changed the covenant regarding our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio at the end of each quarter to not greater than 3.25 to 1. The previous covenant required a ratio of not greater than 3.00 to 1; \n \u2022 added the covenant restricting us from paying any dividends or repurchasing stock, if, after giving such effect to such payments, our leverage ratio is greater than 3.25 to 1; and \n \u2022 changed the covenant restricting us from making acquisitions, if, after giving pro-forma effect to such acquisitions, our leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1, in such case limiting acquisitions to $25.0 million. The previous covenant limiting our ability to make acquisitions under Amendment No. 1 was 2.75 to 1.  A copy of the full terms and conditions of Amendment No. 3 are incorporated by reference in Item 15 to Exhibit 10.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 7, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were $14.6 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility, consisting of the $6.0 million Series A notes issued in March 2011 with a fixed interest rate of 4.00% and a term of seven years, with remaining serial maturities from 2016 to 2018, and the $8.6 million Series B notes issued in June 2011 with a fixed interest rate of 4.10% and a term of 10 years, with remaining serial maturities from 2016 to 2021. The first payment of $2.0 million on Series A notes was made during the first quarter of 2014. The second payment of $2.0 million on Series A notes was made during the first quarter of 2015. The first payment of $1.4 million on Series B notes was made during the second quarter of 2015. We were in compliance with all covenants under this Shelf Agreement as of December 31, 2015.\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland Citizens, N.A.\nOn September 14, 2010, we entered into an overdraft facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland Citizens, N.A. in the amount of \u20ac2.0 million or approximately $2.2 million. There was no balance outstanding on this facility as of December 31, 2015.\nHSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch\nOn June 20, 2012, we entered into a banking facility with the HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch in the amount of $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings on this facility.\nCollateralized Borrowings\nCollateralized borrowings represent deferred sales proceeds on certain leasing transactions with third-party leasing companies. These transactions are accounted for as borrowings, with the related assets capitalized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated straight-line over the lease term.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nCapital lease obligations outstanding are primarily related to sale-leaseback transactions with third-party leasing companies whereby we sell our manufactured equipment to the leasing company and lease it back. The equipment covered by these leases is rented to our customers over the lease term.\nContractual Obligations - Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, are summarized by period due in the following table (in thousands):\n\n(1)Long-term debt represents borrowings through our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan and our Shelf Agreement with Prudential. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan does not have specified repayment terms; therefore, repayment is due upon expiration of the agreement on June 30, 2020. Interest payments on our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were calculated using the December 31, 2015 LIBOR rate based on the assumption that the principal would be repaid in full upon the expiration of the agreement. Our borrowings under our Shelf Agreement with Prudential have 7 and 10 year terms, with remaining serial maturities from 2016 to 2021 with fixed interest rates of 4.00% and 4.10%, respectively.\n(2)Our retirement benefit plans, as described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, require us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. Our plan obligations totaled $5.9 million as of December 31, 2015. Contributions to the various plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the market performance of plan assets, if any, and future changes in interest rates, which impact the actuarial measurement of plan obligations. As a result, we have only included our 2016 expected contribution in the contractual obligations table.\n(3)The unfunded deferred compensation arrangements covering certain current and retired management employees totaled $7.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Our estimated distributions in the contractual obligations table are based upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant distribution elections.\n(4)Operating lease commitments consist primarily of office and warehouse facilities, vehicles and office equipment as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(5)Purchase obligations include all known open purchase orders, contractual purchase commitments and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\n(6)Other obligations include residual value guarantees as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2.3 million and accrued interest and penalties of $0.5 million as of December 31, 2015. We expect to make cash outlays in the future related to uncertain tax positions. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNewly Issued Accounting Guidance\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU will replace all existing revenue recognition standards and significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. This guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. This guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year from the original effective date specified in ASU No. 2014-09. The guidance now permits us to apply the new revenue recognition standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, which is our fiscal 2018. The provisions of the ASU permit companies to adopt the new revenue standard early, but not before the original public organization effective date, which is for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which is our fiscal 2017.\nThe new standard may be adopted retrospectively for all periods presented, or adopted using a modified retrospective approach. Under the retrospective approach, the fiscal 2017 and 2016 financial statements would be adjusted to reflect the effects of applying the new standard on those periods. Under the modified retrospective approach, the new standard would only be applied for the period beginning January 1, 2018 to new contracts and those contracts that are not yet complete at January 1, 2018, with a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings for existing contracts that still require performance. Management is currently evaluating the methods of adoption allowed by the new standard and the effect the standard is expected to have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nSimplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The provisions of the ASU are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, which clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs from line-of-credit arrangements after the adoption of ASU 2015-03. In particular, ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of such arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nCustomer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Intangibles -Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. This amended guidance requires customers to determine whether or not an arrangement includes a software license element. If the arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The provisions of the ASU are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date; or retrospectively. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nSimplifying the Measurement of Inventory\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This amended guidance changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. The provisions of the ASU are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in the classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position and does not affect the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets be offset and presented as a single amount. The amendments in this Update are effective for our annual period beginning January 1, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.\nHowever, earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Thus, we have decided to early adopt ASU No. 2015-17 during the fourth quarter of 2015 and classify any deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the adoption of this ASU, including the method of transition and the overall impact on our financial position.\nNo other new accounting pronouncements issued during 2015 but not yet effective have had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts - We record a reserve for accounts receivable that are potentially uncollectible. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past-due balances. In order to assess the collectability of these receivables, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition. Through these evaluations, we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability, credit ratings or bankruptcy. The reserve", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nTennant Company is a world leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing solutions that empower customers to achieve quality cleaning performance, significantly reduce environmental impact and help create a cleaner, safer, healthier world. Tennant is committed to creating and commercializing breakthrough, sustainable cleaning innovations to enhance its broad suite of products, including: floor maintenance and outdoor cleaning equipment, detergent-free and other sustainable cleaning technologies, aftermarket parts and consumables, equipment maintenance and repair service, specialty surface coatings and asset management solutions. Tennant products are used in many types of environments including: Retail establishments, distribution centers, factories and warehouses, public venues such as arenas and stadiums, office buildings, schools and universities, hospitals and clinics, parking lots and streets, and more. Customers include contract cleaners to whom organizations outsource facilities maintenance, as well as businesses that perform facilities maintenance themselves. The Company reaches these customers through the industry's largest direct sales and service organization and through a strong and well-supported network of authorized distributors worldwide.\nNet Sales in 2015 totaled $811.8 million, down from $822.0 million in the prior year primarily due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 5.5%, lower sales of outdoor equipment and sales declines to our Master Distributor for Russia. These impacts were partially offset by robust sales to strategic accounts in North America and global sales of new products and also selling list price increases. 2015 organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange (and acquisitions and divestitures when applicable), was up approximately 4.3% from 2014 with growth in the Americas and APAC geographical regions. 2015 Gross Profit margin increased 10 basis points to 43.0% from 42.9% in 2014 primarily due to improved operating efficiencies in both the direct service organization and manufacturing operations. This was somewhat offset by foreign currency headwinds that unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points. Selling and Administrative Expense ( S&A Expense\u201d) increased 0.5% from $250.9 million in 2014 to $252.3 million in 2015 primarily due to our 2015 third and fourth quarter restructuring charges, described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, of $3.7 million, or 50 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales. This was somewhat offset by continued cost controls and improved operating efficiencies that favorably impacted S&A Expense in 2015. Operating Profit of $53.2 million in 2015 was down from $72.1 million in the prior year and Operating Profit margin decreased 220 basis points to 6.6% in 2015 from 8.8% in 2014. Operating Profit during 2015 was unfavorably impacted by $14.9 million, or 180 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales, for the non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and the third and fourth quarter restructuring charges. Operating Profit was also unfavorably impacted by higher R&D Expense of $3.0 million as compared to 2014. Due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in 2015, foreign currency exchange reduced Operating Profit by approximately $13.0 million. Net Earnings for 2015 were unfavorably impacted by the $11.2 million pre-tax, or $0.58 per diluted share after-tax, non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as a result of the classification of our Green Machines assets as held for sale in the third quarter of 2015. There were also two restructuring charges included in the 2015 S&A Expense of $3.7 million pre-tax, or $0.17 per diluted share after-tax, to reduce our infrastructure costs.\nNet Earnings for 2014 were $10.4 million greater than 2013. The increase in net earnings resulted primarily from robust organic sales growth and a lower tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the mix in taxable earnings by country and favorable settlements on tax positions from prior years. 2014 Gross Profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 42.9% from 43.3% in 2013 primarily due to strong sales to strategic accounts and through distribution that tend to have lower gross margins and also costs related to hiring and training additional manufacturing employees to support higher levels of production. Net Sales in 2014 totaled $822.0 million, up from $752.0 million in the prior year primarily due to strong sales to strategic accounts and through distribution, continued demand for new products such as the T17 rider scrubber, gains in commercial, industrial and outdoor equipment and selling price increases. 2014 organic sales growth, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately 1.0%, was up approximately 10.3% with growth in all major geographical regions. S&A Expense increased 7.7%, but decreased 50 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales, from $233.0 million in 2013 to $250.9 million in 2014 primarily due to investments in direct sales, distribution and marketing to build organic sales. Operating Profit increased 15.5% and Operating Profit margin increased 50 basis points to 8.8% in 2014 from 8.3% in 2013 due to higher Net Sales and lower R&D Expense and S&A Expense, somewhat offset by lower Gross Margin, as a percentage of Net Sales.\nTennant continues to invest in innovative product development with 4.0% of 2015 Net Sales spent on R&D. During 2015, we continued to invest in developing innovative new products for our traditional core business, as well as in our Orbio Technologies Group, which is focused on advancing a suite of sustainable cleaning technologies. New products and technologies are a key driver of sales growth. 36 new products and product variants were launched in 2015, including new ergonomic backpack vacuum models, our next generation ec-H2O NanoClean\u2122 technology, the T300 family of walk-behind commercial floor scrubbers and our IRIS\u00ae Asset Manager onboard technologies to remotely track machine productivity and maintenance needs.\nWe ended 2015 with a Debt-to-Capital ratio of 8.9%, $51.3 million in Cash and Cash Equivalents compared to $93.0 million at the end of 2014, and Shareholders' Equity of $252.2 million. During 2015, we generated operating cash flows of $45.2 million, paid a total of $14.5 million in cash dividends and repurchased $46.0 million of common stock. Total debt was $24.7 million as of December 31, 2015, compared to $28.1 million at the end of 2014.\nHistorical Results\nThe following table compares the historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in dollars and as a percentage of Net Sales (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

per diluted share, compared to $50.7 million, or $2.70 per diluted share for 2014. Net Earnings were impacted by:\n \u2022 A decrease in Net Sales of 1.2% primarily due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 5.5%, lower sales of outdoor equipment and sales declines to our Master Distributor for Russia. These impacts were partially offset by robust sales to strategic accounts in North America and global sales of new products, such as the T12 and T17 rider scrubbers and the T300 walk behind scrubber, and also selling list price increases. \n \u2022 A 10 basis point increase in Gross Profit margin due to improved operating efficiencies in both the direct service organization and manufacturing operations, somewhat offset by foreign currency headwinds that unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points. \n \u2022 An increase in S&A Expense as a percentage of Net Sales of 60 basis points primarily due to our 2015 third and fourth quarter restructuring charges, described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This was somewhat offset by continued cost controls and improved operating efficiencies that favorably impacted S&A Expense. \n \u2022 An unfavorable impact of 130 basis points, as a percentage of Net Sales, net of tax, for the non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. \n \u2022 An unfavorable direct foreign currency exchange impact to Net Earnings of 110 basis points, as a percentage of Net Sales.  Net Earnings for 2014 were $50.7 million, or $2.70 per diluted share, compared to $40.2 million, or $2.14 per diluted share for 2013. Net Earnings were impacted by:\n \u2022 An increase in Net Sales of 9.3%, primarily due to increased sales to strategic accounts and through distribution, continued demand for new products, gains in commercial, industrial and outdoor equipment, and selling list price increases, typically in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent in most geographies, in March 2014. \n \u2022 A 40 basis point decrease in Gross Profit margin due to strong sales to strategic accounts and through distribution that tend to have lower gross profit margins and also costs related to hiring and training additional manufacturing employees to support the higher levels of production. \n \u2022 A decrease in S&A Expense as a percentage of Net Sales of 50 basis points due to continued cost controls and improved operating efficiencies, somewhat offset by investments in direct sales, distribution and marketing to build organic sales.  Profit Before Income Taxes for 2015 was $50.4 million compared to $69.5 million for 2014 and $59.9 million in 2013.\nThe breakdown of Profit Before Income Taxes between U.S. and foreign operations for each year ended December 31 were as follows:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.5\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.2\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign operations\n</td> <td>(765\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.5)\n</td> <td>17,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td>5,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProfit Before Income Taxes from foreign operations decreased by $18.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was partially due to the $11.2 million non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets recorded in 2015 as a result of our decision to hold the assets and liabilities of our Green Machines outdoor city cleaning line for sale. We further describe this decision in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This impairment affects the results of operations in our EMEA region. In addition, Profit Before Income Taxes in our EMEA subsidiaries decreased by an additional $1.9 million as a result of two worldwide restructuring actions, which are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These restructuring actions also unfavorably impacted Profit Before Income Taxes in our APAC subsidiaries by an additional $0.7 million. Furthermore, Profit Before Income Taxes in our EMEA subsidiaries decreased by an additional $2.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a 15.6% decrease in Net Sales as a result of foreign exchange devaluations and the difficult economic conditions in the European region. Profit Before Income Taxes in our Latin America subsidiaries decreased by approximately $2.8 million in 2015 primarily due to a 26% decrease in net sales due to the devaluation of the Brazilian real and difficult economic conditions in the Latin American countries. Profit Before Income Taxes in our APAC subsidiaries increased by $1.3 million primarily due to lower intercompany interest expense as a result of new intercompany financing agreements and lower intercompany allocations as a result of a legal entity reorganization in 2014.\nProfit Before Income Taxes from foreign operations increased by $12.0 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was partially due to a $3.0 million restructuring charge recorded in 2013 as a result of two restructuring actions in our EMEA region, which were not present in 2014. Additionally, Profit Before Income Taxes in our EMEA subsidiaries increased by an additional $5.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a 5.4% increase in net sales, strong cost controls over S&A Expense and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Profit Before Income Taxes in our APAC region increased by approximately $3.1 million in 2014, primarily due to an 8.8% increase in Net Sales, strong cost controls over S&A Expense and lower foreign exchange losses.\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income Changes\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments - For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded pre-tax foreign currency translation losses of $12.5 million, $10.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income. These adjustments resulted from translating the financial statements of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into our reporting currency, which is the U.S. dollar, as well as other adjustments permitted by ASC 830 - Foreign Currency Matters.\nDuring 2015, we recorded translation losses of $6.5 million relating to the Brazilian real, $5.3 million for the Euro, $0.6 million for the Chinese renminbi and $0.1 million for various other currencies. These adjustments were caused by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these currencies of between 5% and 32% in 2015.\nDuring 2014, we recorded translation losses of $7.0 million relating to the Euro, $1.7 million for the Brazilian real, $1.1 million for the British pound and $0.3 million for various other currencies. These adjustments were caused by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these currencies of between 5% and 15% in 2014.\nDuring 2013, we recorded translation losses of $3.5 million relating to the Brazilian real, offset partially by translation gains of $0.7 million for the British pound, and translation gains for various other currencies of $0.6 million. The Brazilian real weakened by approximately 13% at the end of 2013, while the British pound strengthened slightly.\nPension and Retiree Medical Benefits - For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded pre-tax pension and postretirement liability adjustments consisting of gains of $4.1 million and losses of $5.4 million, respectively, in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income as further disclosed in Note 13 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a gain of $12.3 million in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income for these items.\nThe summarized changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for the three years ended December 31 were as follows:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net actuarial (gain) loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,940\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,351\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of prior service (cost) credit\n</td> <td>(67\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(37\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of net actuarial loss\n</td> <td>(1,114\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(512\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,961\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,282\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $4.1 million gain in 2015 was primarily due to a $2.9 million net actuarial gain relating to a decrease of $2.4 million in the projected benefit obligation resulting from a 32 basis point increase in the U.S. Pension discount rate, a 21 basis point increase in the non-U.S. discount rate and a 31 basis point increase in the postretirement discount rate. There was an approximate $3.3 million decrease in the pension benefit obligation in 2015 relating to demographic experience and other changes, as well as a $3.0 million increase due to a lower than expected actual return of assets. The net actuarial gain was supplemented by a $1.2 million credit relating to amortization of accumulated losses and prior service costs.\nThe $5.4 million loss in 2014 was primarily due to a $5.9 million net actuarial loss relating to an increase of $2.1 million in the projected benefit obligation from adopting a new mortality table in 2014, as well as an increase of $6.6 million in the projected benefit obligation resulting from an 87 basis point decease in the U.S. pension discount rate, a 95 basis point decrease in the non-U.S. discount rate and a 71 basis point decrease in the postretirement discount rate. There was an approximate $0.8 million decrease in the pension benefit obligation in 2014 relating to demographic experience and other changes, as well as a $2.0 million decrease due to higher than expected actual return on assets. The net actuarial loss was partially offset by a $0.5 million credit relating to amortization of accumulated actuarial losses and prior service costs.\nThe $12.3 million gain in 2013 was primarily due to a $10.4 million net actuarial gain relating to a $5.6 million decrease in the projected benefit obligation resulting from an 84 basis point increase in the U.S. pension discount rate, and an 83 basis point increase in the postretirement discount rate. There was an approximate $0.3 million increase in the pension benefit obligation in 2013 relating to demographic experience and other changes, as well as a $5.1 million decrease due to a higher than expected actual return on assets. The net actuarial gain was supplemented by a $1.9 million credit relating to amortization of accumulated actuarial losses and prior service costs.\nNet Sales\nIn 2015, consolidated Net Sales were $811.8 million, a decrease of 1.2% as compared to 2014. Consolidated Net Sales were $822.0 million in 2014, an increase of 9.3% as compared to 2013.\nThe components of the consolidated Net Sales change for 2015 as compared to 2014, and 2014 as compared to 2013, were as follows:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth Elements\n</td> <td>2015 v. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 v. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic Growth:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>3.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic Growth\n</td> <td>4.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign Currency\n</td> <td>(5.5%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>(1.2%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 1.2% decrease in consolidated Net Sales for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 5.5%, lower sales of outdoor equipment and sales declines to our Master Distributor in Russia. These impacts were partially offset by robust sales to strategic accounts in North America and global sales of new products, such as the T12 and T17 rider scrubbers and the T300 walk behind scrubber. Sales of new products introduced within the past three years totaled 26% of equipment revenue in 2015. The 1 percent price increase was the result of selling list price increases, typically in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent in most geographies, with an effective date of February 1, 2015.\nThe 9.3% increase in consolidated Net Sales for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to sales volume increases to strategic accounts and through distribution, continued demand for new products such as the T17 rider scrubber and gains in commercial, industrial and outdoor equipment.\nThe following table sets forth annual Net Sales by operating segment and the related percentage change from the prior year (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>591,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>569,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>514,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe, Middle East and Africa\n</td> <td>139,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>80,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>811,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>821,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>752,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmericas - In 2015, Americas Net Sales increased 3.9% to $591.4 million as compared with $569.0 million in 2014. The primary driver of the increase in Net Sales was attributable to robust sales to strategic accounts in North America and sales of newly introduced products, including the T12 and T17 rider scrubbers and the T300 walk behind scrubber. The direct impact of foreign currency translation exchange effects within the Americas unfavorably impacted Net Sales by approximately 2.5%. As a result, organic sales increased approximately 6.4% in 2015.\nIn 2014, Americas Net Sales increased 10.6% to $569.0 million as compared with $514.5 million in 2013. The primary driver of the increase in Net Sales was attributable to higher sales to strategic accounts, including sales of scrubbers in North America, scrubbers equipped with ec-H2O technology and walk-behind burnishers. Unfavorable direct foreign currency translation exchange effects decreased Net Sales by approximately 1.0%.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa - Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) Net Sales in 2015 decreased 15.6% to $139.8 million as compared to 2014 Net Sales of $165.7 million. Organic sales decreased approximately 2.1% in 2015, which reflected a fragile European economy resulting in lower sales of outdoor equipment and sales declines to our Master Distributor for Russia, somewhat offset by higher sales to strategic accounts and through distribution in Western Europe. Unfavorable direct foreign currency exchange effects decreased EMEA Net Sales by approximately 13.5% in 2015.\nEMEA Net Sales in 2014 increased 5.4% to $165.7 million as compared to 2013 Net Sales of $157.2 million. An organic sales increase of approximately 4.4% was primarily due to higher sales of outdoor equipment, including strong sales of 500ze lithium-ion battery-powered sweepers. Favorable direct foreign currency exchange effects increased EMEA Net Sales by approximately 1.0% in 2014.\nAsia Pacific - Asia Pacific Net Sales in 2015 decreased 7.7% to $80.6 million as compared to 2014 Net Sales of $87.3 million. Organic sales increased approximately 1.3% in 2015 due primarily to organic sales growth in China and Australia, more than offsetting the slower economy in other Asian countries. Unfavorable direct foreign currency exchange effects decreased Net Sales by approximately 9.0% in 2015.\nAsia Pacific Net Sales in 2014 increased 8.8% to $87.3 million as compared to 2013 Net Sales of $80.3 million. An organic sales increase of approximately 12.8% was primarily due to strong sales performance in China, Japan, Southeast Asia and Korea. Unfavorable direct foreign currency exchange effects decreased Net Sales by approximately 4.0% in 2014.\nGross Profit\nGross Profit margin was 43.0% in 2015, an increase of 10 basis points as compared to 2014. Gross Profit margin in 2015 was favorably impacted by operating efficiencies in both the direct service organization and manufacturing operations. This was somewhat offset by foreign currency headwinds that unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points.\nGross Profit margin was 42.9% in 2014, a decrease of 40 basis points as compared to 2013. Gross Profit margin in 2014 was unfavorably impacted by stronger sales to sales channels that tend to have lower gross margins and also costs related to hiring and training additional manufacturing employees and temporary workers to support the higher levels of production, including the continued ramp up to meet the growing demand for new products.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expense - R&D Expense increased $3.0 million, or 10.1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2015 R&D Expense increased 40 basis points to 4.0% in 2015 from 3.6% in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the number of R&D employees and the timing of new product development projects. We continued to invest in developing innovative new products and technologies.\nR&D Expense decreased $1.1 million, or 3.6%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2014 R&D Expense decreased 50 basis points to 3.6% in 2014 from 4.1% in the prior year primarily due to the timing of new product development projects. We continued to invest in developing innovative new products for our traditional core business, as well as our Orbio business.\nSelling and Administrative Expense - S&A Expense increased by $1.4 million, or 0.5%, in 2015 compared to 2014. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2015 S&A Expense increased 60 basis points to 31.1% from 30.5% in 2014 due to continued investments in direct sales and marketing to build organic sales. There were also two restructuring charges totaling $3.7 million, or 50 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales, to reduce our infrastructure costs. These were somewhat offset by strong cost controls and improved operating efficiencies that favorably impacted S&A Expense.\nS&A Expense increased by $17.9 million, or 7.7%, in 2014 compared to 2013. As a percentage of Net Sales, 2014 S&A Expense decreased 50 basis points to 30.5% from 31.0% in 2013 due to continued cost controls and improved operating efficiencies, somewhat offset by investments in direct sales, distribution and marketing to build organic sales that unfavorably impacted S&A Expense.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income - Interest Income was $0.2 million in 2015, a decrease of $0.1 million from 2014. The decrease between 2015 and 2014 was due to lower levels of cash deposits.\nInterest Income was $0.3 million in 2014, a decrease of $0.1 million from 2013. The decrease between 2014 and 2013 was due to decreases in interest rates on cash invested.\nInterest Expense - Interest Expense was $1.3 million in 2015 as compared to $1.7 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a lower level of debt.\nInterest Expense was $1.7 million in 2014 as compared to $1.8 million in 2013. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on long-term adjustable rate borrowings.\nNet Foreign Currency Transaction Losses - Net Foreign Currency Transaction Losses were $1.0 million in 2015 as compared to $0.7 million in 2014. The unfavorable change in the impact from foreign currency transactions in 2015 was due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates and settlements of transactional hedging activity in the normal course of business.\nNet Foreign Currency Transaction Losses were $0.7 million in 2014 and 2013.\nIncome Taxes\nThe overall effective income tax rate was 36.4%, 27.2% and 32.8% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe tax expense for 2015 included a $0.4 million tax benefit associated with an $11.2 million Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and a $0.6 million tax benefit associated with restructuring charges of $3.7 million. We are not able to recognize a tax benefit on the impairment charge until the assets are sold due to a tax valuation allowance. Excluding these items, the 2015 overall effective tax rate would have been 29.6%.\nThe increase in the 2015 overall effective tax rate as compared to the prior year, excluding the effect of the 2015 one-time charges, was primarily related to the mix in our full year taxable earnings by country.\nThere were no special items that affected the tax rate in 2014.\nThe tax expense for 2013 included a $0.1 million tax benefit associated with restructuring charges of $3.0 million. The tax expense also included a first quarter discrete tax benefit of $0.6 million for the enactment of the Federal R&D credit retroactively impacting the tax year ended December 31, 2012. Excluding these special items, the 2013 overall tax rate would have been 32.3%.\nWe do not have any plans to repatriate the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Any repatriation from foreign subsidiaries that would result in incremental U.S. taxation is not being considered. It is management's belief that reinvesting these earnings outside the U.S. is the most efficient use of capital.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity - Cash and Cash Equivalents totaled $51.3 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $93.0 million as of December 31, 2014. Cash and Cash Equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $14.9 million as of December 31, 2015, as compared to $15.8 million as of December 31, 2014. Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to provide working capital to subsidiaries as needed. Our current ratio was 2.2 as of December 31, 2015 and was 2.4 as of December 31, 2014, and our working capital was $160.4 million and $201.5 million, respectively.\nOur Debt-to-Capital ratio was 8.9% as of December 31, 2015, compared with 9.1% as of December 31, 2014. Our capital structure was comprised of $24.7 million of Debt and $252.2 million of Shareholders' Equity as of December 31, 2015.\nCash Flow Summary - Cash provided by (used in) our operating, investing and financing activities is summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing Activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net of Disposals\n</td> <td>(24,444\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,292\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions of Businesses, Net of Cash Acquired\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from Sale of Business\n</td> <td>1,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Increase) Decrease in Restricted Cash\n</td> <td>(322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(253\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing Activities\n</td> <td>(61,405\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,038\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,495\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash and Cash Equivalents\n</td> <td>(1,908\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (Decrease) Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,662\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities - Cash provided by operating activities was $45.2 million in 2015, $59.4 million in 2014 and $59.8 million in 2013. In 2015, cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by cash inflows resulting from $32.1 million of Net Earnings, which includes a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $11.2 million, and a decrease in Receivables, somewhat offset by a decrease in Accounts Payable and an increase in Inventories. The decrease in Receivables was the continued proactive management of our receivables by enforcing tighter credit limits and continuing to successfully collect past due balances.The increase in Inventories was in support of the launches of many new products. Cash provided by operating activities was $14.1 million lower in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower Net Earnings and a year over year increase in Inventories to support the launches of many new products.\nIn 2014, cash provided by operating activities was driven by $50.7 million of Net Earnings and increases in Accounts Payable somewhat offset by increases in Inventories and Receivables. The increase in Inventories was in support of higher sales levels and the launches of many new products. The increase in Receivables was due to higher sales levels, the variety of terms offered and mix of business. Cash provided by operating activities was $0.5 million lower in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to increases year over year in working capital to support the growth in sales.\nFor 2015, we used operating profit and operating profit margin as key indicators of financial performance and the primary metrics for performance-based incentives.\nTwo metrics used by management to evaluate how effectively we utilize our net assets are Accounts Receivable Days Sales Outstanding\u201d ( DSO\u201d) and Days Inventory on Hand\u201d ( DIOH\u201d), on a first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) basis. The metrics are calculated on a rolling three month basis in order to more readily reflect changing trends in the business. These metrics for the quarters ended December 31 were as follows (in days):\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DSO\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DIOH\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDSO decreased 1 day in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to the continued proactive management of our receivables by enforcing tighter credit limits and continuing to successfully collect past due balances having a larger favorable impact than the unfavorable trend in the variety of terms offered and mix of business.\nDIOH increased 5 days in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increased levels of inventory in support of higher sales levels and the launches of many new products somewhat offset by progress from inventory reduction initiatives.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash used for investing activities was $23.6 million in 2015, $17.9 million in 2014 and $11.4 million in 2013. Net capital expenditures were $24.4 million during 2015 as compared to $19.3 million in 2014 and $14.7 million in 2013. Our 2015 capital expenditures included investments in information technology process improvement projects, tooling related to new product development, and manufacturing equipment. Proceeds from Sale of Business provided $1.2 million in 2015, $1.4 million in 2014 and $4.3 million in 2013.\nCapital expenditures in 2014 and 2013 included investments in tooling related to new product development, and manufacturing and information technology process improvement projects.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used for financing activities was $61.4 million in 2015, $28.0 million in 2014 and $21.5 million in 2013. In 2015, the purchases of our common stock per our authorized repurchase program used $46.0 million, dividend payments used $14.5 million and the payment of Long-Term Debt used $3.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock of $1.7 million and the excess tax benefit on stock plans of $0.9 million. In 2014, payments of dividends used $14.5 million, payments of Long-Term Debt used $2.0 million and payments of Short-Term Debt used $1.5 million. In 2013, payments of dividends used $13.2 million and payments of Long-Term Debt used $1.1 million, partially offset by Short-Term Borrowings of $1.5 million. Our annual cash dividend payout increased for the 44th consecutive year to $0.80 per share in 2015, an increase of $0.02 per share over 2014.\nProceeds from the issuance of Common Stock generated $1.7 million in 2015, $2.3 million in 2014 and $8.3 million in 2013.\nOn June 22, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. At December 31, 2015, there were 641,523 remaining shares authorized for repurchase.\nThere were 764,046 shares repurchased in 2015 in the open market, 225,034 shares repurchased in 2014 and 434,118 shares repurchased during 2013, at average repurchase prices of $60.20 during 2015, $62.64 during 2014 and $51.04 during 2013. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank limits the payment of dividends and repurchases of stock to amounts ranging from $50.0 million to $75.0 million per fiscal year based on our leverage ratio after giving effect to such payments for the life of the agreement.\nIndebtedness - As of December 31, 2015, we had committed lines of credit totaling approximately $125.0 million and uncommitted lines of credit totaling approximately $87.2 million. There were $10.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our JPMorgan facility (described below) and $14.6 million in outstanding borrowings under our Prudential facility (described below) as of December 31, 2015. In addition, we had stand alone letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $3.2 million. Commitment fees on unused lines of credit for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $0.3 million.\nOur most restrictive covenants are part of our 2015 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as defined below), which are the same covenants in our Shelf Agreement (as defined below) with Prudential (as defined below), and require us to maintain an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio of not greater than 3.25 to 1 and to maintain an EBITDA to interest expense ratio of no less than 3.50 to 1 as of the end of each quarter. As of December 31, 2015, our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 0.37 to 1 and our EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 64.39 to 1.\nCredit Facilities\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association\nOn June 30, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\") that amended and restated the Credit Agreement dated May 5, 2011 between us and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPMorgan\"), as administrative agent and collateral agent, U.S. Bank National Association, as syndication agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and RBS Citizens, N.A., as co-documentation agents, and the Lenders (including JPMorgan) from time to time party thereto, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated April 25, 2013 (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides us and certain of our foreign subsidiaries access to a senior unsecured credit facility until June 30, 2020, in the amount of $125.0 million, with an option to expand by up to $62.5 million to a total of $187.5 million. Borrowings may be denominated in U.S. dollars or certain other currencies. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains a $100.0 million sublimit on borrowings by foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement principally provides the following changes to the Credit Agreement:\n \u2022 changed the fees for committed funds from an annual rate ranging from 0.20% to 0.35%, depending on our leverage ratio, under the Credit Agreement to an annual rate ranging from 0.175% to 0.300%, depending on our leverage ratio, under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement; \n \u2022 removed RBS Citizens, N.A. as a co-documentation agent; \n \u2022 changed the rate at which Eurocurrency borrowings bear interest from a rate per annum equal to adjusted LIBOR plus an additional spread of 1.30% to 1.90%, depending on our leverage ratio, under the Credit Agreement to a rate per annum equal to adjusted LIBOR plus an additional spread of 1.075% to 1.700%, depending on our leverage ratio, under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement; \n \u2022 under the Credit Agreement, Alternate Base Rate ( ABR\u201d) borrowings bore interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the adjusted LIBOR rate for a one month period plus 1.00%, plus, in any such case, an additional spread of 0.30% to 0.90%, depending on our leverage ratio. The ABR borrowings bear interest under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the adjusted LIBOR rate for a one month period plus 1.00%, plus, in any such case, an additional spread of 0.075% to 0.700%, depending on our leverage ratio.  The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement gives the Lenders a pledge of 65% of the stock of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries. The obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are also guaranteed by certain of our first tier domestic subsidiaries.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting our ability to incur indebtedness and liens and merge or consolidate with another entity. It also incorporates new or recently revised financial regulations and other compliance matters. Further, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains the following covenants:\n \u2022 a covenant requiring us to maintain an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio as of the end of each quarter of not greater than 3.25 to 1. Under the Credit Agreement, the required indebtedness to EBITDA ratio as of the end of each quarter was not greater than 3.00 to 1; \n \u2022 a covenant requiring us to maintain an EBITDA to interest expense ratio as of the end of each quarter of no less than 3.50 to 1; \n \u2022 a covenant restricting us from paying dividends or repurchasing stock if, after giving effect to such payments, our leverage ratio is greater than 2.00 to 1, in such case limiting such payments to an amount ranging from $50.0 million to $75.0 million during any fiscal year based on our leverage ratio after giving effect to such payments; \n \u2022 a covenant restricting us from paying any dividends or repurchasing stock, if, after giving effect to such payments, our leverage ratio is greater than 3.25 to 1; and \n \u2022 a covenant restricting our ability to make acquisitions, if, after giving pro-forma effect to such acquisitions, our leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1, in such case limiting acquisitions to $25.0 million. Under the Credit Agreement, our leverage ratio restriction under this covenant was 2.75 to 1.  A copy of the full terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are incorporated by reference in Item 15 to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 7, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under this Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. There were $10.0 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2015, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.29%.\nPrudential Investment Management, Inc.\nOn July 29, 2009, we entered into a Private Shelf Agreement (the Shelf Agreement\u201d) with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. ( Prudential\u201d) and Prudential affiliates from time to time party thereto. The Shelf Agreement provides us and our subsidiaries access to an uncommitted, senior secured, maximum aggregate principal amount of $80.0 million of debt capital. The Shelf Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting our ability to incur indebtedness and liens and to merge or consolidate with another entity.\nA copy of the full terms and conditions of the Shelf Agreement are incorporated by reference in Item 15 to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 30, 2009.\nOn May 5, 2011, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to our Private Shelf Agreement (the Amendment\u201d).\nThe Amendment principally provided the following changes to the Shelf Agreement:\n \u2022 elimination of the security interest in our personal property and subsidiaries; and \n \u2022 an amendment to our restriction regarding the payment of dividends or repurchase of stock to restrict us from paying dividends or repurchasing stock if, after giving effect to such payments, our leverage ratio is greater than 2.00 to 1, in such case limiting such payments to an amount ranging from $50.0 million to $75.0 million during any fiscal year based on our leverage ratio after giving effect to such payments.  A copy of the full terms and conditions of the Amendment are incorporated by reference in Item 15 to Exhibit 10.2 to the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.\nOn July 24, 2012, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to our Private Shelf Agreement ( Amendment No. 2\u201d), which amended the Shelf Agreement. The principal change effected by Amendment No. 2 was an extension of the Issuance Period for Shelf Notes under the Shelf Agreement.\nA copy of the full terms and conditions of Amendment No. 2 are incorporated by reference in Item 15 to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 26, 2012.\nOn June 30, 2015, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to our Private Shelf Agreement (\"Amendment No. 3\"), which amends the Shelf Agreement by and among the Company, Prudential and Prudential affiliates from time to time party thereto, as amended by Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2.\nAmendment No. 3 principally provided the following changes to the Shelf Agreement:\n \u2022 extended the Issuance Period to June 30, 2018 from July 24, 2015; \n \u2022 changed the covenant regarding our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio at the end of each quarter to not greater than 3.25 to 1. The previous covenant required a ratio of not greater than 3.00 to 1; \n \u2022 added the covenant restricting us from paying any dividends or repurchasing stock, if, after giving such effect to such payments, our leverage ratio is greater than 3.25 to 1; and \n \u2022 changed the covenant restricting us from making acquisitions, if, after giving pro-forma effect to such acquisitions, our leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1, in such case limiting acquisitions to $25.0 million. The previous covenant limiting our ability to make acquisitions under Amendment No. 1 was 2.75 to 1.  A copy of the full terms and conditions of Amendment No. 3 are incorporated by reference in Item 15 to Exhibit 10.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 7, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were $14.6 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility, consisting of the $6.0 million Series A notes issued in March 2011 with a fixed interest rate of 4.00% and a term of seven years, with remaining serial maturities from 2016 to 2018, and the $8.6 million Series B notes issued in June 2011 with a fixed interest rate of 4.10% and a term of 10 years, with remaining serial maturities from 2016 to 2021. The first payment of $2.0 million on Series A notes was made during the first quarter of 2014. The second payment of $2.0 million on Series A notes was made during the first quarter of 2015. The first payment of $1.4 million on Series B notes was made during the second quarter of 2015. We were in compliance with all covenants under this Shelf Agreement as of December 31, 2015.\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland Citizens, N.A.\nOn September 14, 2010, we entered into an overdraft facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland Citizens, N.A. in the amount of \u20ac2.0 million or approximately $2.2 million. There was no balance outstanding on this facility as of December 31, 2015.\nHSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch\nOn June 20, 2012, we entered into a banking facility with the HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch in the amount of $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings on this facility.\nCollateralized Borrowings\nCollateralized borrowings represent deferred sales proceeds on certain leasing transactions with third-party leasing companies. These transactions are accounted for as borrowings, with the related assets capitalized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated straight-line over the lease term.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nCapital lease obligations outstanding are primarily related to sale-leaseback transactions with third-party leasing companies whereby we sell our manufactured equipment to the leasing company and lease it back. The equipment covered by these leases is rented to our customers over the lease term.\nContractual Obligations - Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, are summarized by period due in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term\ndebt(1)\n</td> <td>2,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on capital leases\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement benefit plans(2)\n</td> <td>1,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation arrangements(3)\n</td> <td>7,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating\nleases(4)\n</td> <td>23,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(5)\n</td> <td>59,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(6)\n</td> <td>9,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Long-term debt represents borrowings through our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan and our Shelf Agreement with Prudential. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan does not have specified repayment terms; therefore, repayment is due upon expiration of the agreement on June 30, 2020. Interest payments on our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were calculated using the December 31, 2015 LIBOR rate based on the assumption that the principal would be repaid in full upon the expiration of the agreement. Our borrowings under our Shelf Agreement with Prudential have 7 and 10 year terms, with remaining serial maturities from 2016 to 2021 with fixed interest rates of 4.00% and 4.10%, respectively.\n(2)Our retirement benefit plans, as described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, require us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. Our plan obligations totaled $5.9 million as of December 31, 2015. Contributions to the various plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the market performance of plan assets, if any, and future changes in interest rates, which impact the actuarial measurement of plan obligations. As a result, we have only included our 2016 expected contribution in the contractual obligations table.\n(3)The unfunded deferred compensation arrangements covering certain current and retired management employees totaled $7.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Our estimated distributions in the contractual obligations table are based upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant distribution elections.\n(4)Operating lease commitments consist primarily of office and warehouse facilities, vehicles and office equipment as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(5)Purchase obligations include all known open purchase orders, contractual purchase commitments and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\n(6)Other obligations include residual value guarantees as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2.3 million and accrued interest and penalties of $0.5 million as of December 31, 2015. We expect to make cash outlays in the future related to uncertain tax positions. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNewly Issued Accounting Guidance\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU will replace all existing revenue recognition standards and significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. This guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. This guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year from the original effective date specified in ASU No. 2014-09. The guidance now permits us to apply the new revenue recognition standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, which is our fiscal 2018. The provisions of the ASU permit companies to adopt the new revenue standard early, but not before the original public organization effective date, which is for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which is our fiscal 2017.\nThe new standard may be adopted retrospectively for all periods presented, or adopted using a modified retrospective approach. Under the retrospective approach, the fiscal 2017 and 2016 financial statements would be adjusted to reflect the effects of applying the new standard on those periods. Under the modified retrospective approach, the new standard would only be applied for the period beginning January 1, 2018 to new contracts and those contracts that are not yet complete at January 1, 2018, with a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings for existing contracts that still require performance. Management is currently evaluating the methods of adoption allowed by the new standard and the effect the standard is expected to have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nSimplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The provisions of the ASU are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, which clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs from line-of-credit arrangements after the adoption of ASU 2015-03. In particular, ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of such arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nCustomer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Intangibles -Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. This amended guidance requires customers to determine whether or not an arrangement includes a software license element. If the arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The provisions of the ASU are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date; or retrospectively. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nSimplifying the Measurement of Inventory\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This amended guidance changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. The provisions of the ASU are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in the classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position and does not affect the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets be offset and presented as a single amount. The amendments in this Update are effective for our annual period beginning January 1, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.\nHowever, earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Thus, we have decided to early adopt ASU No. 2015-17 during the fourth quarter of 2015 and classify any deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the adoption of this ASU, including the method of transition and the overall impact on our financial position.\nNo other new accounting pronouncements issued during 2015 but not yet effective have had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts - We record a reserve for accounts receivable that are potentially uncollectible. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past-due balances. In order to assess the collectability of these receivables, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition. Through these evaluations, we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability, credit ratings or bankruptcy.
