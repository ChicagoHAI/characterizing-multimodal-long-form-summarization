Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance, as reflected in the results of our operations, our financial condition and our cash flows. The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included under the section entitled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Our future results could differ materially from our historical performance as a result of various factors such as those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview of our business\nPhibro Animal Health Corporation is a global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. We develop, manufacture and market products for a broad range of food animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle and aquaculture. Our products help prevent, control and treat diseases, enhance nutrition to help improve health and performance and contribute to balanced mineral nutrition. In addition to animal health and mineral nutrition products, we manufacture and market specific ingredients for use in the personal care, automotive, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We sell more than 1,400 product presentations in over 65 countries to approximately 3,000 customers.\nFactors affecting our performance\nIndustry growth\nAccording to Vetnosis, a research and consulting firm specializing in global animal health and veterinary medicine, the global livestock animal health sector represented approximately $19.8 billion of sales in 2015. The market grew at a compound annual growth rate of 3.3% between 2010 and 2015 and the market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5.0% per year between 2015 and 2020. We believe global population growth, the growth of the global middle class and the productivity improvements needed due to limitations of arable land and water supplies have supported and will continue to support this growth.\nRegulatory Developments\nOur business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry. Some in the public perceive risks to human health related to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize certain of our products, including certain of our MFA products. In particular, there is increased focus, primarily in the United States, on the use of medically important antibacterials, as defined by the FDA. Medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health and are listed in the Appendix of the FDA-CVM Guidance for Industry (GFI) #152. Our products that contain virginiamycin, oxytetracycline or neomycin have previously been classified by the FDA as medically important antibacterials. This may lead to a decline in the demand for and production of food products derived from animals that utilize our products and, in turn, demand for our products. Livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of nutrition and health-related concerns, animal rights, and other concerns. Any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries, including us. In addition, campaigns by interest groups, activists and others with respect to perceived risks associated with the use of our products in animals, including position statements by livestock producers and their customers based on non-use of certain medicated products in livestock production, whether or not scientifically-supported, could affect public perceptions and reduce the use of our products. Those adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in animals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our sales in the United States of products that have been classified by the FDA as medically important antibacterials were approximately $37 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nOur business is subject to product registration and authorization regulations. Changes in the regulations could have a material impact on our business. In April 2016, the FDA began initial steps to withdraw approval of Mecadox (carbadox), due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in tissues for longer than previously determined. This initial action by the FDA does not prohibit the sale or use of Mecadox in the United States. Mecadox has been approved and sold in the United States for more than 40 years and is a widely used treatment for controlling bacterial diseases including Salmonella and swine dysentery. Mecadox is not used in human medicine and the class of drug is not considered a medically important antimicrobial. The approved Mecadox label requires a 42-day withdrawal period pre-harvesting, and to date we have not seen any hazardous residues of carbadox being detected from pig meat treated in accordance with the approved label. We have complete confidence in the safety of Mecadox. In response to FDA inquiries several years ago, we began rigorous new studies of the continued safety of the product when used in accordance with the label. Our studies were completed in July 2016, and we submitted our data, analyses and information to the FDA that we believe support the continued safe use of Mecadox. The timing of the FDA's response to our submission is not subject to a predetermined deadline. Our sales of Mecadox in the United States were approximately $15 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. Should we be unable to successfully defend the safety of the product, the loss of Mecadox sales would have a negative impact to the results of our operations.\nCompetition\nThe animal health industry is highly competitive. We believe many of our competitors are conducting R&D activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products. Our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses. In addition to competition from established participants, there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry in the future. Principal methods of competition vary depending on the region, species, product category or individual products, including reliability, reputation, quality, price, service and promotion to veterinary professionals and livestock producers.\nForeign exchange\nWe conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. In fiscal year 2016, we generated approximately 37% of our revenues from operations outside the U.S. Although a portion of our revenues are denominated in various currencies, the selling prices of the majority of our sales outside the United States are referenced in U.S. dollars, and as a result, our revenues have not been significantly directly affected by currency movements. We are subject to currency risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. We manufacture some of our major products in Brazil and Israel and production costs are largely denominated in local currencies, while the selling prices of the products are largely set in U.S. dollars. As such, we are exposed to changes in cost of goods sold resulting from currency movements and may not be able to adjust our selling prices to offset such movements. In addition, we incur selling and administrative expenses in various currencies and are exposed to changes in such expenses resulting from currency movements. Because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations.\nClimate\nThe animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by changing disease pressures and by weather conditions, as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weather-related pressures from diseases. As a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.\nIn addition, livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources, including abundant rainfall to sustain large supplies of drinking water, grasslands and grain production. Their animals' health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods, droughts or other weather conditions. In the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water, livestock producers may purchase less of our products.\nProduct development initiatives\nOur future success depends on both our existing product portfolio, including our ability to obtain cross-clearances enabling the use of our medicated products in conjunction with other products, approval for use of our products with new species, approval for new claims for our products, approval of our products in new markets, and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition. The majority of our R&D programs focus on product lifecycle development, which is defined as R&D programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims, achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations. We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to expanding our product approvals and R&D, both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties.\nRecent Developments\nMVP Acquisition\nIn January 2016, we purchased the assets of MVP. MVP was a developer, manufacturer and marketer of livestock vaccines, vaccine adjuvants and other products. We acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities used in MVP's business, including working capital, intellectual property, manufacturing equipment, real property and facilities. The purchase price of approximately $46.6 million was paid in cash primarily at closing. We incurred $0.6 million in transaction expenses in connection with the acquisition, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisition\u201d for additional information.\nPension Plan and Retirement Savings Plan Changes\nIn July 2016, we amended the domestic noncontributory defined benefit pension plan to eliminate credit for future service and compensation increases, effective as of September 30, 2016. The amendment will result in an estimated $6.7 million pension curtailment gain. The consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, will include the gain in other comprehensive income with an offsetting reduction in the liability for pension benefits included in other liabilities. Effective October 1, 2016, the 401(k) retirement savings plan will include, for all domestic employees, a non-elective Company contribution of 3% of compensation and an additional discretionary contribution of up to 4% of compensation, depending on the employee's age and years of service.\nIn August 2016, we offered a lump sum payment option to certain pension plan participants who are no longer active employees and who do not currently receive benefits. We expect to recognize a partial settlement of the pension plan that will result in a charge to the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ending December 31, 2016. Depending on the participants who elect the option, we estimate the expense will be up to $3.0 million.\nAnalysis of the consolidated statements of operations\nSummary Results of Operations\nTable 24:

adjustments.\n*\nCalculation not meaningful\nChanges in net sales from period to period primarily result from changes in volumes and average selling prices. Although a portion of our net sales is denominated in various currencies, the selling prices of the majority of our sales outside the United States are referenced in U.S. dollars, and as a result, our revenues have not been significantly directly affected by currency movements.\nOur effective income tax rate has varied significantly from period to period and from the federal statutory rate, due to the mix of income tax provisions on profitable foreign jurisdictions; the effect of the release of the valuation allowance against domestic deferred income taxes during fiscal year 2016; minimal income tax provision or benefit being recorded on domestic pre-tax income or losses prior to fiscal year 2016; and the effect of discrete items. Accordingly, we expect our normalized effective tax rate in the future periods to approximate 30%. We intend to continue to reinvest indefinitely the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Income Taxes\u201d for additional information.\nNet sales, Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA\nWe report Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA by segment to understand the operating performance of each segment.

ended June 30, 2016 and 2015\nOur results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 included $8.0 million of revenue and income from milestone payments for licensing of vaccine delivery technology. For a better understanding of underlying trends, we also present comparisons with 2015 that exclude the prior year milestone payments.\nNet sales\nNet sales of\u2009 $751.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $2.9 million, or less than 1%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health grew $15.3 million, while Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products declined $10.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales increased $10.9 million, or 1%.\nAnimal Health\nNet sales of\u2009 $486.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 grew $15.3 million, or 3%. The growth was primarily due to volume increases across all product groups within the segment. Nutritional specialty products grew $12.4 million, or 15%, primarily due to U.S. and E.U. volume growth of our products for the dairy and poultry industries. MFAs and other grew $4.2 million, or 1%, primarily due to volume growth in international markets, which offset declines in domestic volumes. Vaccines declined $1.2 million, or 2%, due to the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue recorded in the prior year. Excluding the prior year $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, vaccines grew $6.8 million, or 15%, principally from volume growth, including sales of MVP products.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales grew $23.3 million, or 5%.\nMineral Nutrition\nNet sales of\u2009 $216.7 million decreased $10.4 million, or 5%, for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease is due to lower average selling prices due to underlying raw material commodity price declines. Increased volumes from improved demand for trace mineral products partially offset the lower average selling prices.\nPerformance Products\nNet sales of\u2009 $48.7 million decreased $2.0 million, or 4%, for the year ended June 30, 2016, due to lower average selling prices of copper-based products and personal care ingredients and lower volumes of chemical catalyst products.\nGross profit\nGross profit of\u2009 $239.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $5.8 million, or 2%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Gross profit increased to 31.8% of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 31.2% for the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health gross profit increased $6.8 million due to volume growth, lower unit costs from improved operating efficiencies and favorable currency movements. Current year Animal Health gross profit was reduced by $2.6 million of acquisition-related cost of goods sold, unfavorable vaccine manufacturing costs related to production interruptions, $1.2 million of acquisition-related intangible amortization and $1.1 million of increased depreciation expense due to recent capital expenditures. Excluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue and gross profit and excluding the current year $2.6 million of acquisition-related cost of goods sold, Animal Health gross profit increased $17.4 million, or 9%. Mineral Nutrition gross profit increased $0.3 million due to lower material costs, partially offset by lower average selling price. Performance Products gross profit decreased $1.3 million due to lower average selling prices of copper-based products and personal care ingredients, partially offset by lower material costs.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue and gross profit, the current year $2.6 million of acquisition-related cost of goods sold and acquisition-related amortization for each year, gross profit increased $17.6 million, or 8%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses of\u2009 $153.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $7.7 million, or 5%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health accounted for $4.9 million of the increase, driven by increased acquisition-related accrued compensation and increased sales force and product development costs. Performance Products account for $0.6 of the increase due to higher environmental remediation costs. Corporate expenses accounted for $2.4 million of the increase, due to acquisition-related transaction costs and increased compensation and office-related costs.\nExcluding acquisition-related intangible amortization, accrued compensation and transaction costs for each year, SG&A increased $6.4 million, or 4%.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net of\u2009 $16.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2016, increased $2.3 million or 16%, compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase is due to interest on increased borrowings under our Revolver and increased acquisition-related accrued interest of\u2009 $0.9 million.\nExcluding acquisition-related accrued interest for each year, interest expense, net increased $1.4 million or 10%.\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net for the year ended June 30, 2016 amounted to net gains of $7.6 million, as compared to $5.4 million in net gains for the year ended June 30, 2015. Foreign currency gains in the year ended June 30, 2016 were primarily due to the movement of Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Argentina currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses primarily arise from intercompany balances.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2016 included a benefit of\u2009 $19.6 million from the release of the valuation allowance for domestic deferred taxes and $4.8 million from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. As a result, the provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2016 was a benefit of\u2009 $6.0 million, an effective tax rate was (7.8)%. Excluding the benefit from these discrete items, the provision for income taxes was an effective tax rate of 24.0%. The provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2015 was $18.5 million, an effective tax rate of 23.5%. The provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2015 included a benefit of\u2009 $1.2 million from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits; excluding the benefit of this discrete item, the provision for income taxes was an effective tax rate of 25.0%.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2016, based on continued domestic profitability, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the value of domestic deferred tax assets would be realized, and it was no longer necessary to maintain a valuation allowance. Prior to releasing the valuation allowance, our domestic provision for income taxes was substantially offset by the utilization of domestic net operating losses that previously had been offset by a valuation allowance. As a result of the release of the valuation allowance, we expect our income tax provision in future periods to increase as we record an income tax provision on our domestic pre-tax income.\nNet income (loss)\nNet income of\u2009 $82.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016, increased $22.4 million, compared to net income of\u2009 $60.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, as a result of the factors described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA of\u2009 $114.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $4.0 million, or 4%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health adjusted EBITDA increased $7.2 million, or 6%, due to sales growth and increased gross profit, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses. Excluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, Animal Health adjusted EBITDA increased $15.2 million, or 14%. Mineral Nutrition increased $0.5 million, or 4%, due to improved operating margins from lower material costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices. Performance Products decreased $1.7 million, or 63%, due to lower average selling prices and higher SG&A costs. Corporate expenses increased $2.0 million due to increased compensation and office-related costs.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, adjusted EBITDA increased $12.0 million, or 12%.\nComparison of fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014\nNet sales\nNet sales of\u2009$748.6 million increased $56.7 million, or 8%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2014, due to growth in Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition of\u2009 $39.7 million and $25.5 million, respectively, offset by declines in Performance Products of\u2009$8.6 million.\nThe consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2015 included $8.0 million of revenue and gross profit related to milestone payments under a license agreement with a global animal health company to share in the use of our proprietary vaccine delivery technology. We recognized the revenue and profit during the period because certain contractual and regulatory milestones were achieved by the licensee, and we had no remaining performance obligations under the agreement. Excluding the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales growth was $48.7 million, or 7%.\nAnimal Health\nNet sales of\u2009$470.8 million grew $39.7 million, or 9%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to volume growth across all product groups. Excluding the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales growth was $31.7 million, or 7%. MFAs and other grew $9.2 million, or 3%, primarily due\nto volume growth in international markets. Nutritional specialty products grew $18.6 million, or 30%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to U.S. volume growth of our products for the dairy industry and their introduction in select European countries. Excluding the effect of the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, vaccines grew $3.9 million, or 10%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, principally from volume growth, including sales of MJB products from the January 2015 date of our Collaboration and Distribution Agreement with MJB, which was entered into as part of the MJB transactions.\nMineral Nutrition\nNet sales of\u2009$227.1 million increased $25.5 million, or 13%, for the year ended June 30, 2015. Increased volumes accounted for approximately three quarters of the sales growth, as current market conditions improved demand for certain trace mineral products. The remainder of the sales increase was due to increased average selling prices primarily due to higher underlying raw material commodity prices.\nPerformance Products\nNet sales of\u2009$50.7 million decreased $8.6 million, or 14%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, due to lower volumes and average selling prices of copper-based products and lower volumes of personal care products.\nGross profit\nGross profit of\u2009$233.3 million increased $28.9 million, or 14%, to 31.2% of net sales, for the year ended June 30, 2015, with most of the improvement coming from Animal Health. Gross profit growth was $20.9 million, or 10%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, excluding the effect of the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue. Animal Health gross profit increased $20.3 million, excluding the effect of the vaccine licensing milestone revenue, due to volume growth and reduced production costs from favorable currency movements. Within Animal Health, MFAs and other contributed $9.6 million of the increase due to volume growth, nutritional specialty products contributed $10.7 million of the increase primarily due to volume growth, higher average selling prices and lower unit costs from improved operating efficiencies and, excluding the vaccine licensing milestone revenue, vaccines gross profit was equal to the prior year as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix. Mineral Nutrition gross profit increased $3.2 million due to higher volumes and higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product costs. Performance Products gross profit decreased $2.8 million due to lower average selling prices and lower volumes.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses of\u2009$145.6 million increased $5.0 million, or 4%, for the year ended June 30, 2015. In 2014 we recognized a $5.4 million loss in our consolidated statement of operations on an insurance claim previously recorded as an asset. Excluding this amount, SG&A expenses increased $10.3 million, or 8%. Animal Health accounted for $9.0 million of the increase, driven by increased selling headcount and related marketing costs to support MFA and vaccine initiatives and the expansion of our products to the dairy industry and by development spending focused on product lifecycle extensions. Animal Health SG&A also increased due to $0.7 million of acquisition-related accrued compensation related to the MJB transactions. Corporate expenses accounted for $1.4 million of the increase due to salary and wage-related costs and professional fees, in part related to the costs of being a public company.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net, of\u2009 $14.3 million decreased $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, due to the net result of issuing new Credit Facilities in April 2014, retiring the Mayflower Limited Partnership ( Mayflower\u201d) Term Loan, the BFI Term Loan and our former Domestic Senior Credit Facility in April 2014 and redeeming our 9.25% Senior Notes in May 2014. Interest expense also increased due to $0.6 million of acquisition-related accrued interest in connection with the MJB transactions.\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net for the year ended June 30, 2015, amounted to net gains of $5.4 million, as compared to $1.8 million in net losses for the year ended June 30, 2014. Foreign currency gains in the current period were primarily due to the movement of Brazil, Israel, Turkey and E.U. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses primarily arise from intercompany balances.\nProvision for income taxes\nIncome tax expense was\u2009$18.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, compared with $9.4 million for 2014. Our effective tax rate was 23.5% for the current year. Our consolidated tax provisions are primarily comprised of income taxes relating to profitable foreign jurisdictions. For the year ended June 30, 2015, we generated domestic taxable income and, because we maintained a full valuation allowance against domestic net deferred tax assets, the provision for income taxes did not include expense related to domestic taxable income. For the year ended June 30, 2014, we generated a domestic taxable loss and, because we maintained a full valuation allowance against domestic net deferred tax assets, the provision for income taxes did not include a benefit related to the domestic taxable loss. The expense for 2014 included a discrete item of\u2009 $3.2 million of foreign withholding tax expense incurred in connection with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. We paid $10.8 million of cash income taxes in the year ended June 30, 2015, compared with $12.2 million in 2014. Payments in 2014 included $3.2 million related to the foreign withholding taxes.\nNet income (loss)\nNet income of\u2009 $60.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, increased $63.4 million, compared to a net loss of\u2009 $3.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2014, as a result of the factors described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA of\u2009$110.0 million increased $19.4 million, or 21%, for the year ended June 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA growth was $11.4 million, or 13%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, excluding the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue. Animal Health adjusted EBITDA increased $12.0 million, or 12%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, excluding the vaccine licensing milestone revenue, due to sales growth and increased gross profit, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses. Mineral Nutrition increased $2.8 million, or 24%, due to higher sales volumes and improved operating margins. Performance Products decreased $2.0 million, or 43%, due to lower sales volumes. Corporate expenses increased $1.4 million due to increases in salary and wage-related costs and professional fees, in part related to the costs of being a public company.\nAnalysis of financial

$37.2 million, primarily attributable to operating profit of\u2009\u2009$85.7 million. Increased inventories used $16.4 million of cash due to timing of purchases and production. Accounts receivable used $13.1 million due to sales growth, the proportion of international sales and the timing of customer orders. Other assets used $6.5 million mainly due to an increase in long-term deposits. Accrued expenses and other liabilities used $7.2 million principally due to funding of retirement plans.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $68.7 million, primarily attributable to operating profit of\u2009\u2009$87.7 million. Increased inventories used $19.4 million of cash due to timing of purchases and production. Accounts receivable used $1.9 million due to sales growth. Accrued expenses used $3.7 million of cash, including $5.3 million paid to customers related to damages to their poultry resulting from the use of one of our products in fiscal year 2010.\nInvesting activities\nFor year ended June 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $82.8 million. Capital expenditures were $36.4 million as we continued to invest in our existing asset base and for capacity expansion and productivity improvements. The MVP acquisition used $46.6 million of cash.\nFor year ended June 30, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $34.5 million. Capital expenditures were $20.1 million as we continued to invest in our existing asset base and for capacity expansion and productivity improvements. As part of the MJB transactions, the Company made a $5.0 million upfront payment and a $5.0 million loan. Other acquisitions and other items used $4.4 million of cash.\nFinancing activities\nFor the year ended June 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $50.4 million. We had net borrowings from our Revolving Credit Facility of\u2009 $66.0 million. We received $4.0 million from the issuance of common shares related to exercise of stock options. Partially offsetting the cash provided were $15.7 million in dividends paid to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock, $2.9 million in scheduled payments on our Term B Loan and $1.0 million in payments for deferred consideration.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2015, net cash used by financing activities was $15.4 million. We paid $15.6 million in dividends to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. In addition, we made $2.9 million in scheduled payments on our Term B Loan. Partially offsetting the cash used was $3.0 million in net borrowings from our Revolving Credit Facility. We received $1.3 million from the issuance of common shares related to exercise of stock options.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nWe believe our cash on hand, our operating cash flows and our financing arrangements, including the availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and foreign credit lines, will be sufficient to support our future cash needs. Our operating plan projects adequate liquidity throughout the year. However, we can provide no assurance that our liquidity and capital resources will be adequate for future funding requirements. We believe we will be able to comply with the terms of the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility and foreign credit lines based on our operating plan. In the event of adverse operating results and/or violation of covenants under the facilities, there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain waivers or amendments. Other risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions and macroeconomic, business and financial disruptions that could arise. There can be no assurance that the challenging economic environment or an economic downturn would not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing. In addition, our debt covenants may restrict our ability to invest. During fiscal year 2016, we spent approximately $36.4 million on capital expenditures, primarily on the expansion of our production capacity. We expect our capital expenditures will total approximately $30 million in fiscal year 2017, primarily for the continued expansion of production capacity and cost reductions in our Animal Health segment.\nCertain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As of June 30\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2016 / 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 / 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>203,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,011) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ratio of current assets to current liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.92:1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.62:1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.63:1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe define working capital as total current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) less total current liabilities (excluding current portion of long-term debt). We calculate the ratio of current assets to current liabilities based on this definition.\nAt June 30, 2016, we had $69.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit and other commitments of\u2009\u2009$14.2 million, leaving $116.8 million available for borrowings and letters of credit. In addition, we had availability totaling $7.8 million under our Israeli loan agreements.\nWe currently intend to pay quarterly dividends, representing $15.8 million annually on our Class A and Class B common stock, subject to approval from the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of\u2009 $0.10 per share on Class A common stock and Class B common stock that is payable on September 28, 2016. Our future ability to pay dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Additionally, the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions.\nAt June 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents included $33.6 million held by our international subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on cash distributions to PAHC from our international subsidiaries. Based on our operating plan, we consider these funds to be indefinitely reinvested in our international operations. Should our plans change and we decide to repatriate some or all of the remaining cash held by our international subsidiaries, the amounts repatriated would be subject to federal and state income taxes at statutory rates, with the potential for partial offsetting credits for taxes paid to international jurisdictions.\nAnalysis of the consolidated balance sheets\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As of June 30\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2016 / 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 / 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,759) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DSO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPayment terms outside the U.S. are typically longer than in the United States. For the periods presented, we have maintained our overall average accounts receivables DSO between 54 and 59 days. We regularly monitor our accounts receivable for collectability, particularly in countries where economic conditions remain uncertain. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. Our assessment is based on such factors as past due history, historical and expected collection patterns, the financial condition of our customers, the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment. We calculate DSO based on a 360-day year and compare accounts receivable with sales for the quarter ending at the balance sheet date.\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As of June 30\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2016 / 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 / 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventories\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInventory increased by $17.9 million in 2016, primarily due to increases in the Animal Health segment from the timing of purchases and production and the acquisition of MVP.\nContractual obligations\nPayments due under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2016, were:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Within 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over 1 to 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over 3 to 5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over 5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (including current portion)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>275,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,061 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,665 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred consideration on acquisitions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>310,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>447,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nExcluded from the contractual obligations table is the liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaling $5.3 million.

This quarterly financial data was prepared on the same basis as, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein. As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we have revised previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 to correct the classification of amortization expense related to product-related intangible assets within the consolidated statement of operations. We originally recorded such amortization expense in selling, general and administrative expenses instead of recording it in cost of goods sold. As a result, cost of goods sold was understated and gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses were overstated. We also have revised the quarterly financial data. The revisions increased cost of goods sold and reduced gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses by $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, December 31, 2015, and March 31, 2016, respectively; by $1.9 million and $3.1 million for the six and nine months ended December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, respectively; by $0.7 million, $0.7 million, $0.9 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014, December 31, 2014, March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015, respectively; and, by $1.4 million and $2.2 million for the six and nine months ended December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, respectively. We concluded the errors were not material to any previously issued financial statements.\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Quarters\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

primary operating measure, and we believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. We report Adjusted EBITDA to portray the results of our operations prior to considering certain income statement elements. We have defined EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision for income taxes or less benefit for income taxes, and (iii) depreciation and amortization. We have defined Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (a) (income) loss from, and\ndisposal of, discontinued operations, (b) other expense or less other income, as separately reported on our consolidated statements of operations, including foreign currency gains and losses and loss on extinguishment of debt, and (c) certain items that we consider to be unusual, non-operational or non-recurring. The Adjusted EBITDA measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP reported net income.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA measure is an important internal measurement for us. We measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how our Adjusted EBITDA measure is utilized:\n\u2022\nsenior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis;\n\u2022\nour annual budgets are prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis; and\n\u2022\nother goal setting and performance measurements are prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis.\nDespite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. Because of its non-standardized definition, Adjusted EBITDA, unlike GAAP net income, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.\nWe also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the Adjusted EBITDA measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric. A limitation of the Adjusted EBITDA measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the depreciation of property, plant and equipment or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies.\nCertain significant items\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated prior to considering certain items. We evaluate such items on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual or non-operational nature. Unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. An example of an unusual item is the loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in fiscal year 2014. We consider foreign currency gains and losses to be non-operational because they arise principally from intercompany transactions and are largely non-cash in nature.\nNew accounting standards\nFor discussion of new accounting standards, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards.\u201d\nSignificant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates\nIn presenting our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales, costs and expenses and related disclosures.\nWe believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments and, therefore, could have the greatest impact on our financial statements.\nAcquisitions, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business beginning as of the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition; goodwill is recorded for any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair values are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to measure the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Our estimates of the useful lives of intangible assets are primarily based on a number of factors including competitive environment, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the products are sold. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives. Intangible assets associated with acquired in-process research and development activities ( IPR&D\u201d) are not amortized until a product is available for sale and regulatory approval is obtained.\nLong-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nWe periodically review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets for impairment and assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of an asset. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss is the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would affect the amount of depreciation and amortization recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. We have not experienced significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets in the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe periodically review our indefinite life intangible assets associated with acquired IPR&D for impairment and assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss is the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. During the fourth quarter of each year, absent any prior impairment indicators, we perform an annual impairment assessment. We elected to apply certain accounting guidance that allows an initial qualitative analysis of the fair value of the indefinite life intangible asset. We have determined the fair value of our IPR&D was not impaired.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we tested goodwill by applying certain accounting guidance that allows an initial qualitative analysis of the fair value of goodwill. We have determined our goodwill was not impaired. We have not recorded any impairment charges since the goodwill was initially recorded.\nWe evaluate our investments in equity method investees for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment may be impaired. The assets underlying a $4.1 million equity investment are currently idled; we have concluded the investment is not currently impaired, based on expected future operating cash flows and/or disposal value.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nOur operations and properties are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing pollution; protection of the environment; the use, management and release of hazardous materials, substances and wastes; air emissions; greenhouse gas emissions; water use, supply and discharge; the investigation and remediation of contamination; the manufacture, distribution, and sale of regulated materials, including pesticides; the importing, exporting and transportation of products; and the health and safety of our employees and the public. As such, the nature of our current and former operations and those of our subsidiaries expose us and our subsidiaries to the risk of claims with respect to such matters, including fines, penalties and remediation obligations that may be imposed by regulatory authorities. We record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available.\nPension Liabilities\nThe measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses. The Company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. The discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. At June 30, 2016, the discount rate for the Company's U.S. pension plan was 3.9% compared to 4.6% at June 30, 2015. The expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.1% represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefit obligations are expected to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data as well as actual returns on the Company's plan assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue for sales of our goods upon transfer of title and when risk of loss passes to the customer. Certain of our businesses have terms where title and risk of loss transfer on shipment. Certain of our businesses have terms where title and risk of loss transfer on delivery. Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collections of sales proceeds are reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including pricing arrangements and other volume-based incentives, at the time the sale is recorded. Royalty and licensing income from licensing agreements are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements, and all performance obligations have been met, and are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Net sales include shipping and handling fees billed to customers. Delivery costs to our customers are included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. Net sales exclude value-added and other taxes based on sales.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. Our annual effective income tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent the tax effect of items recorded as tax expense in our income statement for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect\nof expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our income statement or the tax effect of assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our income tax provision and in evaluating our tax positions. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. Inherent in determining our annual effective income tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.\nWe account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If our initial assessment does not result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the tax benefit if: (i) there are changes in tax law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not;\u201d (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. We regularly re-evaluate our tax positions based on the results of audits of federal, state and foreign income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations, and changes in tax law or receipt of new information that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more-likely-than-not\u201d standard.\nOur assessments concerning uncertain tax positions are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.\nBecause there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our income tax provision, certain future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective income tax rate.\nWe have not provided for United States or additional foreign taxes on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which earnings have been or are intended to be indefinitely reinvested.\nFor more information regarding our significant accounting policies, estimates and assumptions, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards.\u201d\nContingencies\nLegal matters\nWe are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as product liability and other product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings and government investigations.\nCertain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges, which could be substantial. We believe that we have strong defenses in these types of matters, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued.\nWe have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment process relies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.\nEnvironmental\nOur operations and properties are subject to Environmental Laws and regulations. As such, the nature of our current and former operations exposes us to the risk of claims with respect to such matters, including fines, penalties, and remediation obligations that may be imposed by regulatory authorities. Under certain circumstances, we might be required to curtail operations until a particular problem is remedied. Known costs and expenses under Environmental Laws incidental to ongoing operations, including the cost of litigation proceedings relating to environmental matters, are generally included within operating results. Potential costs and expenses may also be incurred in connection with the repair or upgrade of facilities to meet existing or new requirements under Environmental Laws or to investigate or remediate potential or actual contamination and from time to time we establish reserves for such contemplated investigation and remediation costs. In many instances, the ultimate costs under Environmental Laws and the time period during which such costs are likely to be incurred are difficult to predict.\nWhile we believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with Environmental Laws, we have, from time to time, received notices of violation from governmental authorities, and have been involved in civil or criminal action for such violations. Additionally, at various sites, our subsidiaries are engaged in continuing investigation, remediation and/or monitoring efforts to address contamination associated with historic operations of the sites. We devote considerable resources to complying with Environmental Laws and managing environmental liabilities. We have developed programs to identify requirements under, and maintain compliance with Environmental Laws; however, we cannot predict with certainty the impact of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements, or the cost of compliance.\nThe nature of our current and former operations exposes us to the risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and we cannot assure we will not incur material costs and liabilities in connection with such claims. Based upon our experience to date, we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing Environmental Laws, and liabilities for known environmental claims pursuant to such Environmental Laws, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nFor additional details, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Commitments

"item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance, as reflected in the results of our operations, our financial condition and our cash flows. The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included under the section entitled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Our future results could differ materially from our historical performance as a result of various factors such as those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview of our business\nPhibro Animal Health Corporation is a global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. We develop, manufacture and market products for a broad range of food animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle and aquaculture. Our products help prevent, control and treat diseases, enhance nutrition to help improve health and performance and contribute to balanced mineral nutrition. In addition to animal health and mineral nutrition products, we manufacture and market specific ingredients for use in the personal care, automotive, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We sell more than 1,400 product presentations in over 65 countries to approximately 3,000 customers.\nFactors affecting our performance\nIndustry growth\nAccording to Vetnosis, a research and consulting firm specializing in global animal health and veterinary medicine, the global livestock animal health sector represented approximately $19.8 billion of sales in 2015. The market grew at a compound annual growth rate of 3.3% between 2010 and 2015 and the market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5.0% per year between 2015 and 2020. We believe global population growth, the growth of the global middle class and the productivity improvements needed due to limitations of arable land and water supplies have supported and will continue to support this growth.\nRegulatory Developments\nOur business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry. Some in the public perceive risks to human health related to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize certain of our products, including certain of our MFA products. In particular, there is increased focus, primarily in the United States, on the use of medically important antibacterials, as defined by the FDA. Medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health and are listed in the Appendix of the FDA-CVM Guidance for Industry (GFI) #152. Our products that contain virginiamycin, oxytetracycline or neomycin have previously been classified by the FDA as medically important antibacterials. This may lead to a decline in the demand for and production of food products derived from animals that utilize our products and, in turn, demand for our products. Livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of nutrition and health-related concerns, animal rights, and other concerns. Any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries, including us. In addition, campaigns by interest groups, activists and others with respect to perceived risks associated with the use of our products in animals, including position statements by livestock producers and their customers based on non-use of certain medicated products in livestock production, whether or not scientifically-supported, could affect public perceptions and reduce the use of our products. Those adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in animals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our sales in the United States of products that have been classified by the FDA as medically important antibacterials were approximately $37 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nOur business is subject to product registration and authorization regulations. Changes in the regulations could have a material impact on our business. In April 2016, the FDA began initial steps to withdraw approval of Mecadox (carbadox), due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in tissues for longer than previously determined. This initial action by the FDA does not prohibit the sale or use of Mecadox in the United States. Mecadox has been approved and sold in the United States for more than 40 years and is a widely used treatment for controlling bacterial diseases including Salmonella and swine dysentery. Mecadox is not used in human medicine and the class of drug is not considered a medically important antimicrobial. The approved Mecadox label requires a 42-day withdrawal period pre-harvesting, and to date we have not seen any hazardous residues of carbadox being detected from pig meat treated in accordance with the approved label. We have complete confidence in the safety of Mecadox. In response to FDA inquiries several years ago, we began rigorous new studies of the continued safety of the product when used in accordance with the label. Our studies were completed in July 2016, and we submitted our data, analyses and information to the FDA that we believe support the continued safe use of Mecadox. The timing of the FDA's response to our submission is not subject to a predetermined deadline. Our sales of Mecadox in the United States were approximately $15 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. Should we be unable to successfully defend the safety of the product, the loss of Mecadox sales would have a negative impact to the results of our operations.\nCompetition\nThe animal health industry is highly competitive. We believe many of our competitors are conducting R&D activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products. Our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses. In addition to competition from established participants, there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry in the future. Principal methods of competition vary depending on the region, species, product category or individual products, including reliability, reputation, quality, price, service and promotion to veterinary professionals and livestock producers.\nForeign exchange\nWe conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. In fiscal year 2016, we generated approximately 37% of our revenues from operations outside the U.S. Although a portion of our revenues are denominated in various currencies, the selling prices of the majority of our sales outside the United States are referenced in U.S. dollars, and as a result, our revenues have not been significantly directly affected by currency movements. We are subject to currency risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. We manufacture some of our major products in Brazil and Israel and production costs are largely denominated in local currencies, while the selling prices of the products are largely set in U.S. dollars. As such, we are exposed to changes in cost of goods sold resulting from currency movements and may not be able to adjust our selling prices to offset such movements. In addition, we incur selling and administrative expenses in various currencies and are exposed to changes in such expenses resulting from currency movements. Because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations.\nClimate\nThe animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by changing disease pressures and by weather conditions, as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weather-related pressures from diseases. As a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.\nIn addition, livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources, including abundant rainfall to sustain large supplies of drinking water, grasslands and grain production. Their animals' health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods, droughts or other weather conditions. In the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water, livestock producers may purchase less of our products.\nProduct development initiatives\nOur future success depends on both our existing product portfolio, including our ability to obtain cross-clearances enabling the use of our medicated products in conjunction with other products, approval for use of our products with new species, approval for new claims for our products, approval of our products in new markets, and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition. The majority of our R&D programs focus on product lifecycle development, which is defined as R&D programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims, achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations. We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to expanding our product approvals and R&D, both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties.\nRecent Developments\nMVP Acquisition\nIn January 2016, we purchased the assets of MVP. MVP was a developer, manufacturer and marketer of livestock vaccines, vaccine adjuvants and other products. We acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities used in MVP's business, including working capital, intellectual property, manufacturing equipment, real property and facilities. The purchase price of approximately $46.6 million was paid in cash primarily at closing. We incurred $0.6 million in transaction expenses in connection with the acquisition, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisition\u201d for additional information.\nPension Plan and Retirement Savings Plan Changes\nIn July 2016, we amended the domestic noncontributory defined benefit pension plan to eliminate credit for future service and compensation increases, effective as of September 30, 2016. The amendment will result in an estimated $6.7 million pension curtailment gain. The consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, will include the gain in other comprehensive income with an offsetting reduction in the liability for pension benefits included in other liabilities. Effective October 1, 2016, the 401(k) retirement savings plan will include, for all domestic employees, a non-elective Company contribution of 3% of compensation and an additional discretionary contribution of up to 4% of compensation, depending on the employee's age and years of service.\nIn August 2016, we offered a lump sum payment option to certain pension plan participants who are no longer active employees and who do not currently receive benefits. We expect to recognize a partial settlement of the pension plan that will result in a charge to the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ending December 31, 2016. Depending on the participants who elect the option, we estimate the expense will be up to $3.0 million.\nAnalysis of the consolidated statements of operations\nSummary Results of Operations\n\nCertain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments.\n*\nCalculation not meaningful\nChanges in net sales from period to period primarily result from changes in volumes and average selling prices. Although a portion of our net sales is denominated in various currencies, the selling prices of the majority of our sales outside the United States are referenced in U.S. dollars, and as a result, our revenues have not been significantly directly affected by currency movements.\nOur effective income tax rate has varied significantly from period to period and from the federal statutory rate, due to the mix of income tax provisions on profitable foreign jurisdictions; the effect of the release of the valuation allowance against domestic deferred income taxes during fiscal year 2016; minimal income tax provision or benefit being recorded on domestic pre-tax income or losses prior to fiscal year 2016; and the effect of discrete items. Accordingly, we expect our normalized effective tax rate in the future periods to approximate 30%. We intend to continue to reinvest indefinitely the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Income Taxes\u201d for additional information.\nNet sales, Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA\nWe report Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA by segment to understand the operating performance of each segment. This enables us to monitor changes in net sales, costs and other actionable operating metrics at the segment level. See -General description of non-GAAP financial measures\u201d for descriptions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nSegment net sales and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\n(1)\nreflects ratio to total net sales\nA reconciliation of net income, as reported under GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nComparison of fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015\nOur results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 included $8.0 million of revenue and income from milestone payments for licensing of vaccine delivery technology. For a better understanding of underlying trends, we also present comparisons with 2015 that exclude the prior year milestone payments.\nNet sales\nNet sales of\u2009 $751.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $2.9 million, or less than 1%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health grew $15.3 million, while Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products declined $10.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales increased $10.9 million, or 1%.\nAnimal Health\nNet sales of\u2009 $486.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 grew $15.3 million, or 3%. The growth was primarily due to volume increases across all product groups within the segment. Nutritional specialty products grew $12.4 million, or 15%, primarily due to U.S. and E.U. volume growth of our products for the dairy and poultry industries. MFAs and other grew $4.2 million, or 1%, primarily due to volume growth in international markets, which offset declines in domestic volumes. Vaccines declined $1.2 million, or 2%, due to the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue recorded in the prior year. Excluding the prior year $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, vaccines grew $6.8 million, or 15%, principally from volume growth, including sales of MVP products.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales grew $23.3 million, or 5%.\nMineral Nutrition\nNet sales of\u2009 $216.7 million decreased $10.4 million, or 5%, for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease is due to lower average selling prices due to underlying raw material commodity price declines. Increased volumes from improved demand for trace mineral products partially offset the lower average selling prices.\nPerformance Products\nNet sales of\u2009 $48.7 million decreased $2.0 million, or 4%, for the year ended June 30, 2016, due to lower average selling prices of copper-based products and personal care ingredients and lower volumes of chemical catalyst products.\nGross profit\nGross profit of\u2009 $239.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $5.8 million, or 2%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Gross profit increased to 31.8% of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 31.2% for the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health gross profit increased $6.8 million due to volume growth, lower unit costs from improved operating efficiencies and favorable currency movements. Current year Animal Health gross profit was reduced by $2.6 million of acquisition-related cost of goods sold, unfavorable vaccine manufacturing costs related to production interruptions, $1.2 million of acquisition-related intangible amortization and $1.1 million of increased depreciation expense due to recent capital expenditures. Excluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue and gross profit and excluding the current year $2.6 million of acquisition-related cost of goods sold, Animal Health gross profit increased $17.4 million, or 9%. Mineral Nutrition gross profit increased $0.3 million due to lower material costs, partially offset by lower average selling price. Performance Products gross profit decreased $1.3 million due to lower average selling prices of copper-based products and personal care ingredients, partially offset by lower material costs.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue and gross profit, the current year $2.6 million of acquisition-related cost of goods sold and acquisition-related amortization for each year, gross profit increased $17.6 million, or 8%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses of\u2009 $153.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $7.7 million, or 5%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health accounted for $4.9 million of the increase, driven by increased acquisition-related accrued compensation and increased sales force and product development costs. Performance Products account for $0.6 of the increase due to higher environmental remediation costs. Corporate expenses accounted for $2.4 million of the increase, due to acquisition-related transaction costs and increased compensation and office-related costs.\nExcluding acquisition-related intangible amortization, accrued compensation and transaction costs for each year, SG&A increased $6.4 million, or 4%.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net of\u2009 $16.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2016, increased $2.3 million or 16%, compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase is due to interest on increased borrowings under our Revolver and increased acquisition-related accrued interest of\u2009 $0.9 million.\nExcluding acquisition-related accrued interest for each year, interest expense, net increased $1.4 million or 10%.\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net for the year ended June 30, 2016 amounted to net gains of $7.6 million, as compared to $5.4 million in net gains for the year ended June 30, 2015. Foreign currency gains in the year ended June 30, 2016 were primarily due to the movement of Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Argentina currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses primarily arise from intercompany balances.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2016 included a benefit of\u2009 $19.6 million from the release of the valuation allowance for domestic deferred taxes and $4.8 million from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. As a result, the provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2016 was a benefit of\u2009 $6.0 million, an effective tax rate was (7.8)%. Excluding the benefit from these discrete items, the provision for income taxes was an effective tax rate of 24.0%. The provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2015 was $18.5 million, an effective tax rate of 23.5%. The provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2015 included a benefit of\u2009 $1.2 million from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits; excluding the benefit of this discrete item, the provision for income taxes was an effective tax rate of 25.0%.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2016, based on continued domestic profitability, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the value of domestic deferred tax assets would be realized, and it was no longer necessary to maintain a valuation allowance. Prior to releasing the valuation allowance, our domestic provision for income taxes was substantially offset by the utilization of domestic net operating losses that previously had been offset by a valuation allowance. As a result of the release of the valuation allowance, we expect our income tax provision in future periods to increase as we record an income tax provision on our domestic pre-tax income.\nNet income (loss)\nNet income of\u2009 $82.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016, increased $22.4 million, compared to net income of\u2009 $60.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, as a result of the factors described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA of\u2009 $114.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $4.0 million, or 4%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health adjusted EBITDA increased $7.2 million, or 6%, due to sales growth and increased gross profit, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses. Excluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, Animal Health adjusted EBITDA increased $15.2 million, or 14%. Mineral Nutrition increased $0.5 million, or 4%, due to improved operating margins from lower material costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices. Performance Products decreased $1.7 million, or 63%, due to lower average selling prices and higher SG&A costs. Corporate expenses increased $2.0 million due to increased compensation and office-related costs.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, adjusted EBITDA increased $12.0 million, or 12%.\nComparison of fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014\nNet sales\nNet sales of\u2009$748.6 million increased $56.7 million, or 8%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2014, due to growth in Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition of\u2009 $39.7 million and $25.5 million, respectively, offset by declines in Performance Products of\u2009$8.6 million.\nThe consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2015 included $8.0 million of revenue and gross profit related to milestone payments under a license agreement with a global animal health company to share in the use of our proprietary vaccine delivery technology. We recognized the revenue and profit during the period because certain contractual and regulatory milestones were achieved by the licensee, and we had no remaining performance obligations under the agreement. Excluding the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales growth was $48.7 million, or 7%.\nAnimal Health\nNet sales of\u2009$470.8 million grew $39.7 million, or 9%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to volume growth across all product groups. Excluding the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales growth was $31.7 million, or 7%. MFAs and other grew $9.2 million, or 3%, primarily due\nto volume growth in international markets. Nutritional specialty products grew $18.6 million, or 30%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to U.S. volume growth of our products for the dairy industry and their introduction in select European countries. Excluding the effect of the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, vaccines grew $3.9 million, or 10%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, principally from volume growth, including sales of MJB products from the January 2015 date of our Collaboration and Distribution Agreement with MJB, which was entered into as part of the MJB transactions.\nMineral Nutrition\nNet sales of\u2009$227.1 million increased $25.5 million, or 13%, for the year ended June 30, 2015. Increased volumes accounted for approximately three quarters of the sales growth, as current market conditions improved demand for certain trace mineral products. The remainder of the sales increase was due to increased average selling prices primarily due to higher underlying raw material commodity prices.\nPerformance Products\nNet sales of\u2009$50.7 million decreased $8.6 million, or 14%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, due to lower volumes and average selling prices of copper-based products and lower volumes of personal care products.\nGross profit\nGross profit of\u2009$233.3 million increased $28.9 million, or 14%, to 31.2% of net sales, for the year ended June 30, 2015, with most of the improvement coming from Animal Health. Gross profit growth was $20.9 million, or 10%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, excluding the effect of the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue. Animal Health gross profit increased $20.3 million, excluding the effect of the vaccine licensing milestone revenue, due to volume growth and reduced production costs from favorable currency movements. Within Animal Health, MFAs and other contributed $9.6 million of the increase due to volume growth, nutritional specialty products contributed $10.7 million of the increase primarily due to volume growth, higher average selling prices and lower unit costs from improved operating efficiencies and, excluding the vaccine licensing milestone revenue, vaccines gross profit was equal to the prior year as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix. Mineral Nutrition gross profit increased $3.2 million due to higher volumes and higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product costs. Performance Products gross profit decreased $2.8 million due to lower average selling prices and lower volumes.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses of\u2009$145.6 million increased $5.0 million, or 4%, for the year ended June 30, 2015. In 2014 we recognized a $5.4 million loss in our consolidated statement of operations on an insurance claim previously recorded as an asset. Excluding this amount, SG&A expenses increased $10.3 million, or 8%. Animal Health accounted for $9.0 million of the increase, driven by increased selling headcount and related marketing costs to support MFA and vaccine initiatives and the expansion of our products to the dairy industry and by development spending focused on product lifecycle extensions. Animal Health SG&A also increased due to $0.7 million of acquisition-related accrued compensation related to the MJB transactions. Corporate expenses accounted for $1.4 million of the increase due to salary and wage-related costs and professional fees, in part related to the costs of being a public company.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net, of\u2009 $14.3 million decreased $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, due to the net result of issuing new Credit Facilities in April 2014, retiring the Mayflower Limited Partnership ( Mayflower\u201d) Term Loan, the BFI Term Loan and our former Domestic Senior Credit Facility in April 2014 and redeeming our 9.25% Senior Notes in May 2014. Interest expense also increased due to $0.6 million of acquisition-related accrued interest in connection with the MJB transactions.\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net for the year ended June 30, 2015, amounted to net gains of $5.4 million, as compared to $1.8 million in net losses for the year ended June 30, 2014. Foreign currency gains in the current period were primarily due to the movement of Brazil, Israel, Turkey and E.U. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses primarily arise from intercompany balances.\nProvision for income taxes\nIncome tax expense was\u2009$18.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, compared with $9.4 million for 2014. Our effective tax rate was 23.5% for the current year. Our consolidated tax provisions are primarily comprised of income taxes relating to profitable foreign jurisdictions. For the year ended June 30, 2015, we generated domestic taxable income and, because we maintained a full valuation allowance against domestic net deferred tax assets, the provision for income taxes did not include expense related to domestic taxable income. For the year ended June 30, 2014, we generated a domestic taxable loss and, because we maintained a full valuation allowance against domestic net deferred tax assets, the provision for income taxes did not include a benefit related to the domestic taxable loss. The expense for 2014 included a discrete item of\u2009 $3.2 million of foreign withholding tax expense incurred in connection with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. We paid $10.8 million of cash income taxes in the year ended June 30, 2015, compared with $12.2 million in 2014. Payments in 2014 included $3.2 million related to the foreign withholding taxes.\nNet income (loss)\nNet income of\u2009 $60.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, increased $63.4 million, compared to a net loss of\u2009 $3.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2014, as a result of the factors described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA of\u2009$110.0 million increased $19.4 million, or 21%, for the year ended June 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA growth was $11.4 million, or 13%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, excluding the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue. Animal Health adjusted EBITDA increased $12.0 million, or 12%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, excluding the vaccine licensing milestone revenue, due to sales growth and increased gross profit, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses. Mineral Nutrition increased $2.8 million, or 24%, due to higher sales volumes and improved operating margins. Performance Products decreased $2.0 million, or 43%, due to lower sales volumes. Corporate expenses increased $1.4 million due to increases in salary and wage-related costs and professional fees, in part related to the costs of being a public company.\nAnalysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents was:\n\nNet cash provided (used) by operating activities was comprised of:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance, as reflected in the results of our operations, our financial condition and our cash flows. The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included under the section entitled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Our future results could differ materially from our historical performance as a result of various factors such as those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview of our business\nPhibro Animal Health Corporation is a global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. We develop, manufacture and market products for a broad range of food animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle and aquaculture. Our products help prevent, control and treat diseases, enhance nutrition to help improve health and performance and contribute to balanced mineral nutrition. In addition to animal health and mineral nutrition products, we manufacture and market specific ingredients for use in the personal care, automotive, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We sell more than 1,400 product presentations in over 65 countries to approximately 3,000 customers.\nFactors affecting our performance\nIndustry growth\nAccording to Vetnosis, a research and consulting firm specializing in global animal health and veterinary medicine, the global livestock animal health sector represented approximately $19.8 billion of sales in 2015. The market grew at a compound annual growth rate of 3.3% between 2010 and 2015 and the market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5.0% per year between 2015 and 2020. We believe global population growth, the growth of the global middle class and the productivity improvements needed due to limitations of arable land and water supplies have supported and will continue to support this growth.\nRegulatory Developments\nOur business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry. Some in the public perceive risks to human health related to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize certain of our products, including certain of our MFA products. In particular, there is increased focus, primarily in the United States, on the use of medically important antibacterials, as defined by the FDA. Medically important antibacterials include classes that are prescribed in animal and human health and are listed in the Appendix of the FDA-CVM Guidance for Industry (GFI) #152. Our products that contain virginiamycin, oxytetracycline or neomycin have previously been classified by the FDA as medically important antibacterials. This may lead to a decline in the demand for and production of food products derived from animals that utilize our products and, in turn, demand for our products. Livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of nutrition and health-related concerns, animal rights, and other concerns. Any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries, including us. In addition, campaigns by interest groups, activists and others with respect to perceived risks associated with the use of our products in animals, including position statements by livestock producers and their customers based on non-use of certain medicated products in livestock production, whether or not scientifically-supported, could affect public perceptions and reduce the use of our products. Those adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in animals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our sales in the United States of products that have been classified by the FDA as medically important antibacterials were approximately $37 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nOur business is subject to product registration and authorization regulations. Changes in the regulations could have a material impact on our business. In April 2016, the FDA began initial steps to withdraw approval of Mecadox (carbadox), due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in tissues for longer than previously determined. This initial action by the FDA does not prohibit the sale or use of Mecadox in the United States. Mecadox has been approved and sold in the United States for more than 40 years and is a widely used treatment for controlling bacterial diseases including Salmonella and swine dysentery. Mecadox is not used in human medicine and the class of drug is not considered a medically important antimicrobial. The approved Mecadox label requires a 42-day withdrawal period pre-harvesting, and to date we have not seen any hazardous residues of carbadox being detected from pig meat treated in accordance with the approved label. We have complete confidence in the safety of Mecadox. In response to FDA inquiries several years ago, we began rigorous new studies of the continued safety of the product when used in accordance with the label. Our studies were completed in July 2016, and we submitted our data, analyses and information to the FDA that we believe support the continued safe use of Mecadox. The timing of the FDA's response to our submission is not subject to a predetermined deadline. Our sales of Mecadox in the United States were approximately $15 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. Should we be unable to successfully defend the safety of the product, the loss of Mecadox sales would have a negative impact to the results of our operations.\nCompetition\nThe animal health industry is highly competitive. We believe many of our competitors are conducting R&D activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products. Our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses. In addition to competition from established participants, there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry in the future. Principal methods of competition vary depending on the region, species, product category or individual products, including reliability, reputation, quality, price, service and promotion to veterinary professionals and livestock producers.\nForeign exchange\nWe conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. In fiscal year 2016, we generated approximately 37% of our revenues from operations outside the U.S. Although a portion of our revenues are denominated in various currencies, the selling prices of the majority of our sales outside the United States are referenced in U.S. dollars, and as a result, our revenues have not been significantly directly affected by currency movements. We are subject to currency risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. We manufacture some of our major products in Brazil and Israel and production costs are largely denominated in local currencies, while the selling prices of the products are largely set in U.S. dollars. As such, we are exposed to changes in cost of goods sold resulting from currency movements and may not be able to adjust our selling prices to offset such movements. In addition, we incur selling and administrative expenses in various currencies and are exposed to changes in such expenses resulting from currency movements. Because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations.\nClimate\nThe animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by changing disease pressures and by weather conditions, as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weather-related pressures from diseases. As a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.\nIn addition, livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources, including abundant rainfall to sustain large supplies of drinking water, grasslands and grain production. Their animals' health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods, droughts or other weather conditions. In the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water, livestock producers may purchase less of our products.\nProduct development initiatives\nOur future success depends on both our existing product portfolio, including our ability to obtain cross-clearances enabling the use of our medicated products in conjunction with other products, approval for use of our products with new species, approval for new claims for our products, approval of our products in new markets, and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition. The majority of our R&D programs focus on product lifecycle development, which is defined as R&D programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims, achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations. We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to expanding our product approvals and R&D, both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties.\nRecent Developments\nMVP Acquisition\nIn January 2016, we purchased the assets of MVP. MVP was a developer, manufacturer and marketer of livestock vaccines, vaccine adjuvants and other products. We acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities used in MVP's business, including working capital, intellectual property, manufacturing equipment, real property and facilities. The purchase price of approximately $46.6 million was paid in cash primarily at closing. We incurred $0.6 million in transaction expenses in connection with the acquisition, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Acquisition\u201d for additional information.\nPension Plan and Retirement Savings Plan Changes\nIn July 2016, we amended the domestic noncontributory defined benefit pension plan to eliminate credit for future service and compensation increases, effective as of September 30, 2016. The amendment will result in an estimated $6.7 million pension curtailment gain. The consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, will include the gain in other comprehensive income with an offsetting reduction in the liability for pension benefits included in other liabilities. Effective October 1, 2016, the 401(k) retirement savings plan will include, for all domestic employees, a non-elective Company contribution of 3% of compensation and an additional discretionary contribution of up to 4% of compensation, depending on the employee's age and years of service.\nIn August 2016, we offered a lump sum payment option to certain pension plan participants who are no longer active employees and who do not currently receive benefits. We expect to recognize a partial settlement of the pension plan that will result in a charge to the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ending December 31, 2016. Depending on the participants who elect the option, we estimate the expense will be up to $3.0 million.\nAnalysis of the consolidated statements of operations\nSummary Results of Operations\nTable 24:

adjustments.\n*\nCalculation not meaningful\nChanges in net sales from period to period primarily result from changes in volumes and average selling prices. Although a portion of our net sales is denominated in various currencies, the selling prices of the majority of our sales outside the United States are referenced in U.S. dollars, and as a result, our revenues have not been significantly directly affected by currency movements.\nOur effective income tax rate has varied significantly from period to period and from the federal statutory rate, due to the mix of income tax provisions on profitable foreign jurisdictions; the effect of the release of the valuation allowance against domestic deferred income taxes during fiscal year 2016; minimal income tax provision or benefit being recorded on domestic pre-tax income or losses prior to fiscal year 2016; and the effect of discrete items. Accordingly, we expect our normalized effective tax rate in the future periods to approximate 30%. We intend to continue to reinvest indefinitely the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Income Taxes\u201d for additional information.\nNet sales, Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA\nWe report Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA by segment to understand the operating performance of each segment. This enables us to monitor changes in net sales, costs and other actionable operating metrics at the segment level.

ended June 30, 2016 and 2015\nOur results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 included $8.0 million of revenue and income from milestone payments for licensing of vaccine delivery technology. For a better understanding of underlying trends, we also present comparisons with 2015 that exclude the prior year milestone payments.\nNet sales\nNet sales of\u2009 $751.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $2.9 million, or less than 1%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health grew $15.3 million, while Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products declined $10.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales increased $10.9 million, or 1%.\nAnimal Health\nNet sales of\u2009 $486.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 grew $15.3 million, or 3%. The growth was primarily due to volume increases across all product groups within the segment. Nutritional specialty products grew $12.4 million, or 15%, primarily due to U.S. and E.U. volume growth of our products for the dairy and poultry industries. MFAs and other grew $4.2 million, or 1%, primarily due to volume growth in international markets, which offset declines in domestic volumes. Vaccines declined $1.2 million, or 2%, due to the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue recorded in the prior year. Excluding the prior year $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, vaccines grew $6.8 million, or 15%, principally from volume growth, including sales of MVP products.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales grew $23.3 million, or 5%.\nMineral Nutrition\nNet sales of\u2009 $216.7 million decreased $10.4 million, or 5%, for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease is due to lower average selling prices due to underlying raw material commodity price declines. Increased volumes from improved demand for trace mineral products partially offset the lower average selling prices.\nPerformance Products\nNet sales of\u2009 $48.7 million decreased $2.0 million, or 4%, for the year ended June 30, 2016, due to lower average selling prices of copper-based products and personal care ingredients and lower volumes of chemical catalyst products.\nGross profit\nGross profit of\u2009 $239.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $5.8 million, or 2%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Gross profit increased to 31.8% of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 31.2% for the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health gross profit increased $6.8 million due to volume growth, lower unit costs from improved operating efficiencies and favorable currency movements. Current year Animal Health gross profit was reduced by $2.6 million of acquisition-related cost of goods sold, unfavorable vaccine manufacturing costs related to production interruptions, $1.2 million of acquisition-related intangible amortization and $1.1 million of increased depreciation expense due to recent capital expenditures. Excluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue and gross profit and excluding the current year $2.6 million of acquisition-related cost of goods sold, Animal Health gross profit increased $17.4 million, or 9%. Mineral Nutrition gross profit increased $0.3 million due to lower material costs, partially offset by lower average selling price. Performance Products gross profit decreased $1.3 million due to lower average selling prices of copper-based products and personal care ingredients, partially offset by lower material costs.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue and gross profit, the current year $2.6 million of acquisition-related cost of goods sold and acquisition-related amortization for each year, gross profit increased $17.6 million, or 8%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses of\u2009 $153.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $7.7 million, or 5%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health accounted for $4.9 million of the increase, driven by increased acquisition-related accrued compensation and increased sales force and product development costs. Performance Products account for $0.6 of the increase due to higher environmental remediation costs. Corporate expenses accounted for $2.4 million of the increase, due to acquisition-related transaction costs and increased compensation and office-related costs.\nExcluding acquisition-related intangible amortization, accrued compensation and transaction costs for each year, SG&A increased $6.4 million, or 4%.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net of\u2009 $16.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2016, increased $2.3 million or 16%, compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase is due to interest on increased borrowings under our Revolver and increased acquisition-related accrued interest of\u2009 $0.9 million.\nExcluding acquisition-related accrued interest for each year, interest expense, net increased $1.4 million or 10%.\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net for the year ended June 30, 2016 amounted to net gains of $7.6 million, as compared to $5.4 million in net gains for the year ended June 30, 2015. Foreign currency gains in the year ended June 30, 2016 were primarily due to the movement of Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Argentina currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses primarily arise from intercompany balances.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2016 included a benefit of\u2009 $19.6 million from the release of the valuation allowance for domestic deferred taxes and $4.8 million from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. As a result, the provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2016 was a benefit of\u2009 $6.0 million, an effective tax rate was (7.8)%. Excluding the benefit from these discrete items, the provision for income taxes was an effective tax rate of 24.0%. The provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2015 was $18.5 million, an effective tax rate of 23.5%. The provision for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2015 included a benefit of\u2009 $1.2 million from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits; excluding the benefit of this discrete item, the provision for income taxes was an effective tax rate of 25.0%.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2016, based on continued domestic profitability, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the value of domestic deferred tax assets would be realized, and it was no longer necessary to maintain a valuation allowance. Prior to releasing the valuation allowance, our domestic provision for income taxes was substantially offset by the utilization of domestic net operating losses that previously had been offset by a valuation allowance. As a result of the release of the valuation allowance, we expect our income tax provision in future periods to increase as we record an income tax provision on our domestic pre-tax income.\nNet income (loss)\nNet income of\u2009 $82.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016, increased $22.4 million, compared to net income of\u2009 $60.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, as a result of the factors described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA of\u2009 $114.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $4.0 million, or 4%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Animal Health adjusted EBITDA increased $7.2 million, or 6%, due to sales growth and increased gross profit, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses. Excluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, Animal Health adjusted EBITDA increased $15.2 million, or 14%. Mineral Nutrition increased $0.5 million, or 4%, due to improved operating margins from lower material costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices. Performance Products decreased $1.7 million, or 63%, due to lower average selling prices and higher SG&A costs. Corporate expenses increased $2.0 million due to increased compensation and office-related costs.\nExcluding the prior year $8.0 million of vaccine licensing milestone revenue, adjusted EBITDA increased $12.0 million, or 12%.\nComparison of fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014\nNet sales\nNet sales of\u2009$748.6 million increased $56.7 million, or 8%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2014, due to growth in Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition of\u2009 $39.7 million and $25.5 million, respectively, offset by declines in Performance Products of\u2009$8.6 million.\nThe consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2015 included $8.0 million of revenue and gross profit related to milestone payments under a license agreement with a global animal health company to share in the use of our proprietary vaccine delivery technology. We recognized the revenue and profit during the period because certain contractual and regulatory milestones were achieved by the licensee, and we had no remaining performance obligations under the agreement. Excluding the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales growth was $48.7 million, or 7%.\nAnimal Health\nNet sales of\u2009$470.8 million grew $39.7 million, or 9%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to volume growth across all product groups. Excluding the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, net sales growth was $31.7 million, or 7%. MFAs and other grew $9.2 million, or 3%, primarily due\nto volume growth in international markets. Nutritional specialty products grew $18.6 million, or 30%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to U.S. volume growth of our products for the dairy industry and their introduction in select European countries. Excluding the effect of the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, vaccines grew $3.9 million, or 10%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, principally from volume growth, including sales of MJB products from the January 2015 date of our Collaboration and Distribution Agreement with MJB, which was entered into as part of the MJB transactions.\nMineral Nutrition\nNet sales of\u2009$227.1 million increased $25.5 million, or 13%, for the year ended June 30, 2015. Increased volumes accounted for approximately three quarters of the sales growth, as current market conditions improved demand for certain trace mineral products. The remainder of the sales increase was due to increased average selling prices primarily due to higher underlying raw material commodity prices.\nPerformance Products\nNet sales of\u2009$50.7 million decreased $8.6 million, or 14%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, due to lower volumes and average selling prices of copper-based products and lower volumes of personal care products.\nGross profit\nGross profit of\u2009$233.3 million increased $28.9 million, or 14%, to 31.2% of net sales, for the year ended June 30, 2015, with most of the improvement coming from Animal Health. Gross profit growth was $20.9 million, or 10%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, excluding the effect of the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue. Animal Health gross profit increased $20.3 million, excluding the effect of the vaccine licensing milestone revenue, due to volume growth and reduced production costs from favorable currency movements. Within Animal Health, MFAs and other contributed $9.6 million of the increase due to volume growth, nutritional specialty products contributed $10.7 million of the increase primarily due to volume growth, higher average selling prices and lower unit costs from improved operating efficiencies and, excluding the vaccine licensing milestone revenue, vaccines gross profit was equal to the prior year as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix. Mineral Nutrition gross profit increased $3.2 million due to higher volumes and higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product costs. Performance Products gross profit decreased $2.8 million due to lower average selling prices and lower volumes.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses of\u2009$145.6 million increased $5.0 million, or 4%, for the year ended June 30, 2015. In 2014 we recognized a $5.4 million loss in our consolidated statement of operations on an insurance claim previously recorded as an asset. Excluding this amount, SG&A expenses increased $10.3 million, or 8%. Animal Health accounted for $9.0 million of the increase, driven by increased selling headcount and related marketing costs to support MFA and vaccine initiatives and the expansion of our products to the dairy industry and by development spending focused on product lifecycle extensions. Animal Health SG&A also increased due to $0.7 million of acquisition-related accrued compensation related to the MJB transactions. Corporate expenses accounted for $1.4 million of the increase due to salary and wage-related costs and professional fees, in part related to the costs of being a public company.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net, of\u2009 $14.3 million decreased $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, due to the net result of issuing new Credit Facilities in April 2014, retiring the Mayflower Limited Partnership ( Mayflower\u201d) Term Loan, the BFI Term Loan and our former Domestic Senior Credit Facility in April 2014 and redeeming our 9.25% Senior Notes in May 2014. Interest expense also increased due to $0.6 million of acquisition-related accrued interest in connection with the MJB transactions.\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net for the year ended June 30, 2015, amounted to net gains of $5.4 million, as compared to $1.8 million in net losses for the year ended June 30, 2014. Foreign currency gains in the current period were primarily due to the movement of Brazil, Israel, Turkey and E.U. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses primarily arise from intercompany balances.\nProvision for income taxes\nIncome tax expense was\u2009$18.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, compared with $9.4 million for 2014. Our effective tax rate was 23.5% for the current year. Our consolidated tax provisions are primarily comprised of income taxes relating to profitable foreign jurisdictions. For the year ended June 30, 2015, we generated domestic taxable income and, because we maintained a full valuation allowance against domestic net deferred tax assets, the provision for income taxes did not include expense related to domestic taxable income. For the year ended June 30, 2014, we generated a domestic taxable loss and, because we maintained a full valuation allowance against domestic net deferred tax assets, the provision for income taxes did not include a benefit related to the domestic taxable loss. The expense for 2014 included a discrete item of\u2009 $3.2 million of foreign withholding tax expense incurred in connection with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. We paid $10.8 million of cash income taxes in the year ended June 30, 2015, compared with $12.2 million in 2014. Payments in 2014 included $3.2 million related to the foreign withholding taxes.\nNet income (loss)\nNet income of\u2009 $60.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, increased $63.4 million, compared to a net loss of\u2009 $3.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2014, as a result of the factors described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA of\u2009$110.0 million increased $19.4 million, or 21%, for the year ended June 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA growth was $11.4 million, or 13%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, excluding the $8.0 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue. Animal Health adjusted EBITDA increased $12.0 million, or 12%, for the year ended June 30, 2015, excluding the vaccine licensing milestone revenue, due to sales growth and increased gross profit, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses. Mineral Nutrition increased $2.8 million, or 24%, due to higher sales volumes and improved operating margins. Performance Products decreased $2.0 million, or 43%, due to lower sales volumes. Corporate expenses increased $1.4 million due to increases in salary and wage-related costs and professional fees, in part related to the costs of being a public company.\nAnalysis of financial
