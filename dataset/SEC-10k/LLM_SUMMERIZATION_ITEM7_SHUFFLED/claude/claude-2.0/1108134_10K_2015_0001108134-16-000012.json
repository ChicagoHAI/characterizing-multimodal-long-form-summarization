MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThis discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion. The accounting and reporting policies followed by the Company conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While the Company bases estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe SEC defines critical accounting policies\u201d as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods. Please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion. Management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the SEC's definition:\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses represents probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio at the financial statement date and which may be estimated. Management uses historical information, as well as current economic data, to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors, which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen. Although management believes that it uses appropriate available information to establish the allowance for loan losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. Conditions in the local economy and real estate values could require the Company to increase provisions for loan losses, which would negatively impact earnings.\nAcquired Loans. Loans that the Company acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses. Determining the fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. Going forward, the Company continues to evaluate reasonableness of expectations for the timing and the amount of cash to be collected. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows may result in changes in the amortization or accretion of fair market value adjustments, and in some cases may result in the loan being considered impaired. For collateral dependent loans with deteriorated credit quality, the Company estimates the fair value of the underlying collateral of the loans. These values are discounted using market derived rates of return, with consideration given to the period of time and costs associated with the foreclosure and disposition of the collateral.\nIncome Taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities. The realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable ordinary income, taxable capital gain income, and the existence of prior years' taxable income, to which \"carry back\" refund claims could be made. A valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that management estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. In determining the valuation allowance, the Company uses historical and forecasted future operating results, including a review of the eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. In particular, income tax benefits and deferred tax assets generated from tax-advantaged commercial development projects are based on management's assessment and interpretation of applicable tax law as it currently stands. These underlying assumptions can change from period to period. For example, tax law changes or variances in projected taxable ordinary income or taxable capital gain income could result in a change in the deferred tax asset or the valuation allowance. Should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those considered by management, the actual realization of the net deferred tax asset could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. If the Company is not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset in excess of the valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made.\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded as a result of business acquisitions and combinations. These assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When these assets are evaluated for impairment, if the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to income. The fair value is based on observable market prices, when practicable. Other valuation techniques may be used when market prices are unavailable, including estimated discounted cash flows and analysis of market pricing multiples. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. In the event of future changes in fair value, the Company may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.\nDetermination of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities. The Company evaluates debt and equity securities within the Company's available for sale and held to maturity portfolios for other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI\"), at least quarterly. If the fair value of a debt security is below the amortized cost basis of the security, OTTI is required to be recognized if any of the following are met: (1) the Company intends to sell the security; (2) it is \"more likely than not\" that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) for debt securities, the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For all impaired debt securities that the Company intends to sell, or more likely than not will be required to sell, the full amount of the loss is recognized as OTTI through earnings. Credit-related OTTI for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings. Noncredit related OTTI for such debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. In evaluating its marketable equity securities portfolios for OTTI, the Company considers its intent and ability to hold an equity security to recovery of its cost basis in addition to various other factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer. Any OTTI on marketable equity securities is recognized immediately through earnings. Should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those expected by management, the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Trading assets, securities available for sale, and derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, or to establish a loss allowance or write-down based on the fair value of impaired assets. Further, the notes to financial statements include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the valuation methodologies used and its impact to earnings. For financial instruments not recorded at fair value, the notes to financial statements disclose the estimate of their fair value. Due to the judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimation process, the estimates could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.\nSUMMARY\nIn 2015, Berkshire expanded through acquisition and business development, and made progress in rebuilding profitability compared to the prior two years. Berkshire acquired Hampden, a Springfield area community bank, in the second quarter and Firestone, a national specialty equipment finance company, in the third quarter. Business development included ongoing commercial expansion, recruitment of market managers in targeted business lines, and investment in tax advantaged development projects in the Company's footprint. The Company's income also continued to benefit from recoveries achieved on the resolution of impaired loans acquired in recent acquisitions.\nBerkshire financed the two acquisitions primarily through the issuance of common stock, which was accretive to most of the Company's capital metrics. The Company completed its transition from the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund ( DIF\u201d), which was initiated in 2014. Demand deposit increases drove organic deposit growth throughout this transition, even while seven branches were being consolidated and one branch was being sold as part of Berkshire's ongoing management of its sales and service channels across its regions. Including the loans acquired with Firestone, the Company increased its utilization of wholesale funding, including expanded use of brokered deposits. Berkshire increased its shareholder dividend and also grew its tangible book value per share as a result of the double digit return on tangible equity.\nInterest rates remained low throughout much of the year, and credit conditions in the region continued to be comparatively strong. As a result, industry margins remained under pressure due to ongoing yield compression and competitive conditions. Through its acquisitions and balance sheet strategies, Berkshire increased its net interest margin while also maintaining strong asset performance metrics and maintaining positive asset sensitivity. Growth in the U.S. economy contributed to economic improvement throughout most of the Company's markets, with conditions particularly strong in the Boston and Albany markets.\nThe Company improved its efficiency including the benefit of achieving the targeted 35% cost saves associated with the Hampden acquisition and lowering the funding costs of the Firestone portfolio. Berkshire improved its brand messaging with new brand signage in all locations and targeted promotions with prominent spokespersons. Community support initiatives were expanded, and mobile banking solutions were enhanced including the addition of Apple Pay\u00ae functionality. The Company promoted and reorganized executive management to strengthen leadership across its footprint and business lines.\nBerkshire's near term goal is to generate further revenue driven positive operating leverage to improve profitability. The Company is pursuing initiatives to improve fee revenues and non-interest income and the balance sheet will continue to be managed to support profitability, capital, liquidity, and interest rate risk objectives. At year-end 2015, the Company had a pending agreement to purchase a prominent SBA lender scheduled for the first quarter of 2016, which is expected to contribute to these objectives.\nCOMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nSummary: Berkshire continued to extend, deepen, and diversify its banking footprint in 2015. Total assets increased by $1.3 billion, or 20%, to $7.8 billion, including $687 million in assets resulting from the Hampden acquisition and $201 million in assets resulting from the Firestone acquisition. Excluding these acquisitions, organic asset growth totaled $442 million, or 7%, primarily due to 8% loan growth excluding acquired loans. Deposits acquired from Hampden totaled $484 million, and deposit growth from business activities totaled 10% which funded most of the remaining growth in the loan portfolio. The loan/deposit ratio increased slightly to 102% from 101% during the year. The Company's risk management maintained the momentum of favorable and improving asset quality while also producing significant recoveries of purchased impaired loans which contributed to the year's income. The acquisitions were primarily financed with stock consideration and were accretive to Berkshire's capital ratios. Internal capital generation was also sufficient to support growth from business activities, along with a dividend increase and strengthening of capital metrics. Berkshire's focus on improving profitability is targeted to further strengthen internal capital generation as a fundamental element of its capital strength. Berkshire continues to manage its interest rate sensitivity with the goal of benefiting income from expected future increases in interest rates and to limit the risk to income and equity from higher interest rates in the long term.\nInvestment Securities. Berkshire's goal is to maintain a high quality portfolio consisting primarily of liquid investment securities with managed durations to limit the potential for market value declines in rising rate markets. Berkshire focuses on loan growth as the primary use of funds and the primary source of interest income. The investment portfolio is an additional source of interest income and also provides additional liquidity and interest rate risk management flexibility. The Company evaluates the portfolio within its overall objectives of producing growth in earnings per share and contributing to return on equity. The Company continuously evaluates options for managing the portfolio's size, yield, diversification, risk, and duration.\nIn 2015, the portfolio was generally managed to maintain yield in the ongoing environment of low interest rates and yield compression. The most significant activity related to the integration of the acquired Hampden securities portfolio. Total securities increased by $165 million, or 14%, to $1.371 billion in 2015. This included $72 million of investment securities and $83 million in cash and short term investments acquired with Hampden Bank. Hampden had liquidated a portion of its $145 million year-end 2014 investment portfolio prior to the merger and some of these amounts were reinvested by Berkshire. The overall duration of these investments was lengthened to support a higher earnings contribution from the acquired Hampden operations, and the resulting growth in Berkshire's portfolio was concentrated in medium term agency collateralized mortgage obligations and long term municipal bonds. Most acquired municipal bonds were designated as held to maturity as part of the Company's balance sheet strategies to manage the market price risk reflected in its equity capital. In addition to its activities with investment grade securities, the Bank reduced its investment in non-investment grade securities in 2015. Investments in bank capital instruments were reduced as a result of new regulatory requirements that increased the required capital support for these investments. The Bank reduced its investment in equity securities and trust preferred securities by $23 million in 2015.\nAs a result of the Company's strategies, the fourth quarter yield on the investment portfolio decreased only slightly to 2.96% in 2015 compared to 3.00% in 2014, despite the decrease in rates between those periods. The average life of the bond portfolio was 4.9 years at year-end, compared to 4.5 years at the start of the year.\nThe net unrealized gain on the investment portfolio was $11 million, or 0.8% of cost at year-end. This was down from $18 million, or 1.6% of cost at the start of the year. While average long term interest rates were down in 2015, they increased near year-end following the historic increase in short term rates announced by the Federal Reserve Bank in December. This caused a reduction in unrealized bond gains as of year-end. There were no impairment losses recorded in 2015 and all securities were performing during the year and at year-end.\nThe Company realized $4 million in securities gains and $2 million in losses in 2015. The gains were primarily on bank equity securities, including a $2 million gain on the investment in Hampden stock as well as gains on stocks of other banks due to mergers announced by those institutions during the year. The bond losses related primarily to the reduction in non-investment grade bonds in the final quarter due to deteriorating market conditions. In addition to net securities gains, the Company also had a $1 million benefit to non-interest income from special non-dividend distributions received from certain stocks and mutual funds. As a result of its charter change in 2014, the Bank is no longer permitted to invest in new equity securities, but the holding company is permitted to make equity investments subject to certain regulatory restrictions.\nLoans. Berkshire posted loan growth of $1.04 billion, or 22%, to $5.7 billion in 2015, of which 14% was contributed as a result of acquisitions and 8% was due to business activities. Growth from business activities was in residential mortgage loans and commercial loans and was a primary focus of the Company's initiatives to increase earnings and profitability. Business activities included both direct originations in market as well as wholesale transactions with other financial institutions. Strategies included targeted remixing of the portfolio to improve pricing spreads and relationship profitability. Despite the ongoing low rate environment, Berkshire achieved an increase in the fourth quarter loan yield to 4.15% in 2015 compared to 3.96% in 2014. The portfolio was further diversified in 2015 and credit metrics improved and remained comparatively strong. The portfolio duration was lengthened modestly to contribute to the yield objective. Through its executive team expansion, Berkshire continues to strengthen its commercial loan oversight and administration and to adhere to its disciplines for credit underwriting and portfolio management. Changes in the portfolio composition in 2015 included runoff of certain balances where competitive pricing and credit conditions for renewing credits were not consistent with the Company's underwriting and pricing guidelines. Berkshire's asset resolution team has continued to generate significant income through recoveries in its collection and resolution of impaired loans acquired in bank acquisitions.\nLoan growth from acquisitions in 2015 included the Hampden acquisition in April and the Firestone acquisition in August. The $493 million Hampden loan portfolio consisted largely of Springfield area loans and included $130 million of residential mortgages, $281 million of commercial loans, and $82 million of consumer loans. At acquisition, the portfolio was recorded with a 1.7% discount to Hampden's net carrying value. This $8 million discount included a $12 million discount on purchased credit impaired loans, and a net $4 million premium on non-impaired loans which primarily reflected the premium value of fixed rate loans. Since 2011, Hampden's annual net loan charge-offs averaged less than 0.20% of average loans. The Firestone portfolio consisted of equipment loans to small specialized businesses in a national portfolio which have higher lending spreads that reflect the additional administration that is characteristic of this specialized business line. Berkshire views the credit history of these acquired operations as favorable. The $194 million Firestone portfolio was recorded with a 1.4% discount to net carrying value. This $3 million discount included a $4 million discount on purchased credit impaired loans, and a net $1 million premium on non-impaired loans.\nBerkshire has also emphasized the development of its SBA loan program and has achieved a leading position as an originator of SBA guaranteed loans in several of its regional markets. Commercial loans secured with government guarantees increased to $39 million from $16 million in 2015. Near the end of 2015, Berkshire announced an agreement to acquire the lending team of 44 Business Capital, a nationally ranked SBA originator that will further contribute to the growth and diversification of Berkshire's SBA lending business.\nBerkshire continues to focus on strategic commercial loan growth to increase earnings, market share, and business relationships, while taking advantage of its size and geographic positioning to gain market share from national banks. The Bank's commercial banking teams operate out of its seven commercial regional offices to provide commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans together with commercial depository and banking services, as well as insurance and wealth management services. The Bank also has an asset based lending group based in its Burlington, MA office which services the entire footprint. The addition of Firestone represents an expansion of Berkshire's commercial specialty lending operations and is the first line of business with a national footprint. The Company's growing small business banking team is part of the Bank's retail organization and small business loans are included in commercial loan totals. This team improved its competitive position and was a leader in SBA lending in several of Berkshire's regions in 2015. The planned acquisition of 44 Business Capital will broaden and strengthen Berkshire's SBA lending capabilities and add the Mid-Atlantic and other geographies to its lending operations. These expanded SBA operations will also add a secondary marketing and loan servicing capacity which is expected to diversify revenues, expand product competitiveness, and lead to further business volume growth. This complements the expanded wholesale component of the Company's lending operations which include regional and national loan participations as well as loan purchases and potential sales of targeted commercial loan products.\nThe commercial loan portfolio increased by $692 million, or 29%, in 2015, including $475 million in acquired loans. The remaining $217 million increase in commercial loans represented 9% organic growth. Most of this growth was in commercial real estate loans, including construction loans, multifamily loans, and non-owner occupied commercial real estate. Recent regulatory pronouncements have reiterated guidance for management of commercial real estate exposures. As measured by\nregulatory categories, the commercial real estate portfolio measured 232% of the Bank's risk based capital at year-end 2015 and commercial construction loans measured 40% of risk based capital. The growth of commercial and industrial loans in 2015 was primarily due to the Firestone acquisition, and including the impact of this change, the Company reduced certain other C&I exposures to support its objectives for improving the net interest margin and overall return on equity. The Company has no significant direct exposure to the oil and gas industries. During the year, certain relationships were outplaced or released to competition based on the Company's pricing and credit disciplines. Improvements in the loan yield and in asset quality included the benefit of these activities. In the final quarter of the year, the yield on commercial loans before purchased loan accretion was 4.27% which was increased significantly from 3.90% in the final quarter of 2014 due to the acquisition, growth, and mix strategies.\nBerkshire's Home Lending operation originated approximately $791 million in residential mortgages in 2015, compared to approximately $546 million in the prior year. A decrease in long term interest rates in the first quarter of 2015 spurred higher refinancing volume in the first half of the year, and originations slowed in the second half of the year.\nResidential real estate markets were comparatively strong in Eastern Massachusetts, where the majority of the Company's loan originators are located. Additionally, the Company added to its originations team in other regions in its footprint.\nThe Company originates a significant portion of its mortgages for sale to manage interest rate risk associated with fixed rate mortgages. Revenue is recorded at the time that the application is rate-locked. The Company originated $438 million in rate-locks of held for sale mortgages in 2015, compared to $304 million in the prior year. Most jumbo mortgages are retained due to the lack of secondary market demand, and much of the Eastern Massachusetts production consists of jumbo mortgages due to elevated home prices in that region. Rate lock income on mortgages originated for sale is the primary component of Berkshire's mortgage banking fee income. Net of acquired Hampden loans and net of secondary market sales and other wholesale purchases and sales of residential mortgages, the mortgage portfolio increased by $189 million, or 13% in 2015. Wholesale purchases of mortgages in and around Berkshire's markets totaled $124 million and wholesale sales of seasoned mortgages totaled $121 million. Gains on seasoned loan sales are a component of other loan related non-interest income. Due to ongoing interest rate compression, the yield on the portfolio decreased to 3.72% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 3.88% in the same quarter of 2014.\nThe consumer loan portfolio increased by $34 million, or 4%, to $802 million in 2015 due to $82 million in acquired Hampden balances. Excluding the acquired balances, the portfolio decreased by $48 million, or 6% due to planned runoff of indirect auto loans. In the latter part of 2014, the Company changed its strategy to de-emphasize lower rate super prime indirect auto loans as part of its net interest margin strategy, and the indirect auto portfolio has declined steadily since that time. In the third quarter of 2015, Berkshire announced the recruitment of a new team leader to expand the Company's network for prime indirect auto paper and the Company expects that consumer loan outstandings will increase in 2016 as this team builds new business volume, and the Company contemplates potential secondary market sales of indirect auto loans in future years based on its fee income and balance sheet strategies. The consumer loan portfolio yield decreased to 3.30% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 3.35% in the final quarter of 2014 due to ongoing yield compression and the Company's origination strategies. The portfolio yield was increasing in the second half of 2015, including the benefit of the acquired Hampden loans and the aging and runoff of the older super prime loans. The Company's goal is to maintain the yield of this portfolio and to gradually increase it if interest rates remain steady or increase.\nBerkshire favors a profile of net interest income related interest rate risk that is neutral or asset sensitive and accepts a profile of equity at risk which is modestly liability sensitive due to market factors in the ongoing low rate environment. The Bank offers back-to-back interest rate swaps to certain commercial loan customers, which allows the Bank to book a variable rate loan while providing the customer with a contract to fix its interest rate. This allows the Company to be more competitive with national financing sources without booking long-term, fixed rate assets at current low interest rates, as well as providing a source of fee income. At year-end 2015, approximately 32% of the loan portfolio was scheduled to reprice within one year, 27% was scheduled to reprice in one - five years, and 41% was scheduled to reprice over five years. The comparable percentages at the prior year-end were 37%, 24%, and 39% respectively. The duration of the portfolio lengthened modestly in 2015 as part of the Company's strategy for improving the net interest margin. The Company estimated that the fair value of net loans exceeded carrying value by approximately 1.0% at year-end 2015, compared to 1.1% at the start of the year. This decrease reflected the impact of the acquired loans recorded at fair value and higher year-end interest rates, offsetting the benefit of improved asset quality.\nAsset Quality. Berkshire has a Chief Risk Officer and a Risk Management and Capital Committee of the Board which keep a close focus on maintaining strong asset quality. This includes setting loan portfolio objectives, maintaining sound underwriting, close portfolio oversight, and careful management of problem assets and potential problem assets. Additionally, merger due diligence is an integral component of maintaining asset quality. Acquired loans are recorded at fair value and are deemed\nperforming regardless of their payment status. Therefore, some overall portfolio measures of asset quality are not comparable between years or among institutions as a result of recent business combinations. A general goal is to achieve significant resolutions of impaired loans acquired in bank mergers in the first year following the acquisition date. Berkshire's asset quality has reflected its strong credit disciplines together with the generally favorable economic characteristics of its region.\nNet loan charge-offs were 0.25% of average loans in 2015, compared to 0.29% in the prior year. Year-end 2015 non-performing assets decreased to $23 million, or 0.29% of total assets, from $24 million, or 0.37% of total assets, at the start of the year. For loans from business activities, net loan charge-offs measured 0.26% of average loans in 2015, while this measure was 0.23% for average loans acquired in business combinations.\nLoans classified as accruing troubled debt restructurings decreased to $12 million from $13 million during the year. Foreclosed real estate was unchanged at $2 million. Accruing loans over 90 days past due improved to 0.06% from 0.8% of total loans, and loans delinquent 30-89 days improved to 0.32% from 0.42% of total loans.\nAt year-end 2015, the remaining carrying balance of purchased credit impaired loans was $21 million and the contractual amount owed on these loans was $40 million. The comparable measures at year-end 2014 were $14 million and $26 million, respectively. In 2015, purchased credit impaired loans acquired from Hampden were recorded with a fair value of $17 million compared to a $29 million contractual balance. The balances acquired from Firestone were recorded with a value of $2 million compared to a $5 million contractual balance.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, Berkshire entered into an agreement to acquire the business model of 44 Business Capital and certain other assets of Parke Bank's SBA 7(a) loan program operations. As part of the agreement, 44 Business Capital's team will join Berkshire. The agreement includes the purchase of SBA loans totaling approximately $38 million that were originated through this team. These loans share pro rata with the SBA in the collateral and creditor rights under the loan agreements.\nThe underwriting parameters for the lending operations of Firestone and 44 Business Capital reflect the specialized nature of these operations and are in some respects outside of Berkshire's traditional underwriting guidelines. Berkshire views the credit histories of these operations as favorable and has established controls to integrate these operations into its credit administration processes. They are expected to enhance the Company's product capabilities and diversify its relationship base and related revenues and credit risk characteristics.\nLoan Loss Allowance. The determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate. The Company's methodologies for determining the loan loss allowance are discussed in Item 1 of this report, and Item 8 includes further information about the accounting policy for the loan loss allowance and the Company's accounting for the allowance in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company considers the allowance for loan losses appropriate to cover probable losses which can be reasonably estimated and which are inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Under accounting standards for business combinations, acquired loans are recorded at fair value with no loan loss allowance on the date of acquisition. The fair value of acquired loans includes the impact of estimated loan losses for the life of the portfolio, including factors which are not probable or inherent as of the acquisition date, and including subjective assessments of risk. A loan loss allowance is recorded by the Company for the emergence of new probable and estimable losses relating to acquired loans which were not impaired as of the acquisition date. Because of the accounting for acquired loans, some measures of the loan loss allowance are not comparable to periods prior to the acquisition date or to other financial institutions. Loans acquired in business combinations totaled $1.16 billion, or 20% of total loans at year-end 2015, compared to $762 million, or 16% of total loans at year-end 2014.\nThe Company viewed its asset quality as comparatively good and improving in 2015 based on both its loans from business activities as well as acquired loans. The Company viewed the overall environmental factors as supportive of this assessment, including economic conditions and real estate market conditions and values.\nThe total amount of the allowance increased in 2015, while the ratio of the allowance to total loans decreased to 0.69% from 0.76%. For loans from business activities, this ratio decreased to 0.76% of total loans from 0.84%. For loans acquired in business combinations, the ratio increased slightly to 0.41% from 0.38%. The year-end allowance provided 3.0X coverage of total net charge-offs in 2015, compared to 2.8X in 2014. The allowance provided 1.9X coverage of year-end non-accrual loans in 2015 compared to 1.6X in 2014.\nThe credit risk profile of the Company's loan portfolio is described in the Loan Loss Allowance note in the consolidated financial statements. The Company's risk management process focuses primary attention on loans with higher than normal risk, which includes loans rated special mention and classified (substandard and lower). These loans are referred to as criticized loans. Including acquired loans, criticized loans totaled $145 million, or 1.9% of total assets, at year-end 2015 compared to\n$130 million, or 2.0% of assets at year-end 2014. The Company views its potential problem loans as those loans from business activities which are rated as classified and continue to accrue interest. These loans have a possibility of loss if weaknesses are not corrected. Classified loans acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value and are classified as performing at the time of acquisition and therefore are not generally viewed as potential problem loans. In 2015, potential problem loans decreased to $61 million from $67 million. Criticized assets include two $10 million secured commercial loan participations related to raw materials companies that are performing and which were downgraded in 2015 due to revenue declines. The Company's evaluation of its credit risk profile also compares the amount of criticized loan and foreclosed assets to the total of the Bank's Tier 1 Capital plus the loan loss allowance. This ratio was 24% at year-end 2015, compared to 28% at the start of the year.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued a Proposed Accounting Standards Update (Subtopic 825-15), more commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, or CECL. It is proposed to move from an incurred loss model to a life-of-expected loss model. FASB has proposed to remove the probability threshold, adding forecasting, and requiring more in-depth analysis and disclosure for the credit loss estimation. It is anticipated that banks will generally carry higher loan loss allowance estimates as a result of this change and that loan loss estimates be made at acquisition date for loans acquired in business combinations. Further analysis of the impacts of this expected change will depend on final implementation rules.\nOther Assets. There were immaterial changes in total premises and the category of other assets in 2015 due to the acquisitions and growth in business activities. Total intangible assets increased by $58 million to $335 million due to the goodwill associated with the Hampden and Firestone acquisitions. Intangibles totaled 6.3% of the assets acquired with Hampden and 7.8% of the acquired Firestone assets. Bank owned life insurance and the net deferred tax asset increased primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions. Cash and short term investments increased due to business growth and to high overnight funds at year-end.\nDeposits. Berkshire's deposits increased by $934 million, or 20%, to $5.6 billion in 2015. This funded most of the 22% increase in the loan portfolio. The acquired Hampden deposits contributed a 10% increase in the portfolio, brokered time deposits contributed 9%, and 3% growth was contributed by transaction account balances. Ongoing business development remains focused on relationship oriented retail and commercial offerings. The Company has actively managed its branch network in recent years. In 2015, the Company added ten branches through the Hampden acquisition and consolidated seven branches and sold its Tennessee branch (related to the 2012 Beacon Federal acquisition). The total branch count was 93 offices at the end of the year, compared to 91 at the start of the year. The Company is evaluating further opportunities for denovo locations and branch designs and technology enhancements, as well as additional sales/consolidations of existing branches. Berkshire continues to diversify its distribution network, including expanding its My Banker and private banking teams and integrating more closely with its wealth management, investment services, small business, insurance, and other business lines. Berkshire also continues to enhance its mobile and electronic delivery channels, and introduced the Apple Pay\u00ae service in 2015. The Company is initiating the rollout of real time customer feedback technology. In 2015, the Company completed its shift away from the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund ( DIF\u201d) due to the Company's growth beyond the DIF insurance limits. There were mix shifts in the deposit portfolio as management adjusted its strategies following the Hampden acquisition and targeted newer market segments and institutional balances.\nThe Hampden deposit portfolio consisted largely of Springfield area accounts and increased Berkshire's estimated market share to a top four position in that market. These acquired deposits included $97 million in demand deposits, $51 million in NOW accounts, $62 million in money market accounts, $120 million in savings balances, and $154 million in time account balances. Berkshire's deposit cost decreased from 0.44% in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 0.42% in the second quarter of 2015 and then increased to 0.48% in the fourth quarter reflecting higher costs of money market accounts related to targeted promotions.\nTransaction accounts, which include demand deposit and NOW accounts, increased by 12% in 2015, excluding acquired balances. Most of this growth was in the second half of the year and included strong growth of both personal and commercial account balances. Checking accounts are an important focus of Berkshire's relationship acquisition and development strategies. Total personal deposit accounts were $3.35 billion, or 69% of total deposits excluding brokered time accounts at year-end 2015. This percentage was unchanged from year-end 2014.\nThe Company has increased its utilization of brokered time deposits over the last two years to better manage deposit costs and interest rate risk, and to diversify its funding of loan portfolio growth. Brokered time deposits increased by $404 million to $784 million in 2015. At year-end, the average maturity of this portfolio was 7 months, with an average cost of 0.70%. Additionally, as a result of its DIF insurance termination, the Company has increased its use of reciprocal money market deposits, which offer full insurance to certain commercial and institutional customers in the Company's markets. These balances increased to $102 million from $9 million during the year and are viewed as components of the Company's relationship deposit balances. Also related to the DIF termination, the Company has increased its pledging of investment\nsecurities to collateralize certain municipal deposit account balances. Securities pledged to these accounts increased to $136 million from $42 million during the year.\nBorrowings and Other Liabilities. All of Berkshire's senior borrowings at year-end were provided by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston under established relationship programs. The FHLBB is secured by a general pledge of assets primarily consisting of mortgage backed securities and residential mortgages. The Bank uses FHLBB borrowings to manage overnight liquidity and generally to provide funding for its investment portfolio. Other components of the Bank's wholesale funding program include correspondent banks and brokerages, and brokered deposits. For contingency liquidity purposes, the Bank has short term credit arrangements with the Federal Reserve Bank and with certain national banks and brokerages, and the holding company maintains a line of credit. There has been no regular ongoing use of these arrangements. As previously discussed, over the last two years, the Bank has expanded its use of time deposits raised through established broker relationships to fund a portion of loan growth, as an alternative to borrowed funds. The Company evaluates its use of borrowings and of wholesale funds in general in managing its liquidity and strategic growth plans. This is further discussed in the following section on Liquidity.\nTotal borrowings increased by $212 million, or 20%, to $1.26 billion in 2015. This included $119 million in acquired Hampden borrowings. Acquired Firestone borrowings were replaced with brokered time deposits. Most borrowings are short term; they totaled $1.07 billion, or 85% of total borrowings, at year-end 2015. The weighted average rate on short term borrowings was 0.43% at year-end. FHLBB short term rates are generally priced at a premium of up to 0.25% compared to short term treasury rates, and they are viewed as well correlated with LIBOR. Due to the Federal Reserve Bank's 0.25% hike in the target Fed Funds rate in December 2015, the Company expects the cost of short term borrowings to increase in 2016. Additionally, the cost of interest rate swaps is a component of borrowings interest expense. These swaps are discussed in the following section, and the cost of forward starting swaps becomes effective in 2016 and is expected to contribute to higher borrowing costs in 2016.\nOther liabilities increased by $6 million to $91 million in 2015. The balance at year-end 2014 included a $22 million amount payable for commercial loan participation interests purchased at year-end; there was no similar balance due at year-end 2015. This decrease was partially offset by a $10 million increase in the fair value liability of derivative securities which is discussed in a later section, along with growth in operating accruals.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities. Berkshire utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk of its borrowings, to offer these instruments to commercial loan customers for similar purposes, and as part of its residential mortgage banking activities. The instruments sold to commercial and residential mortgage customers are an important source of fee income. Demand for these products tends to vary inversely with the direction of interest rates, and they are more popular when interest rates are decreasing and customers wish to lock in long term fixed interest rates that the Company cannot offer directly based on its own funding sources.\nThe notional value of derivatives increased by $332 million, or 32%, to $1.37 billion in 2015. This included $320 million due to growth in commercial loan interest rate swaps, reflecting the improved market demand and the Company's focus on serving this niche, which often involves larger, stronger commercial accounts with other relationship potential. Each such swap involves a derivative sold to the customer and a generally matching derivative purchased from a national counterparty. Accordingly, this net growth reflects about $160 million in underlying loans to provide commercial customers with a contracted fixed rate while allowing the Bank to record a variable rate loan. This net growth from $90 million in the prior year contributed to the increase in loan related fee income previously discussed.\nThere were no significant changes in the cash flow hedges on bank borrowings or the non-hedging derivatives related to mortgage banking. The cash flow hedges consist of $300 million in forward starting three year interest rate swaps which become effective on average in the second quarter of 2016 at an average annual cost of 2.29% and which hedge certain short term FHLBB borrowings. The cost of these hedges will be included in borrowings interest expense when they become effective, which is expected to increase funding costs and decrease the net interest margin as a result. These hedges are an important component of maintaining the Bank's positive interest rate sensitivity. The unrealized loss on these hedges increased to $9 million at the end of the year from $3 million at the start of the year due to the change in market expectations that rates will stay lower for longer compared to earlier expectations. This change was the primary factor in the increase in the overall estimated fair value liability on all derivatives to $11 million from $6 million during the year.\nStockholders' Equity. Berkshire pursues a balance of capital to maintain financial soundness while using common equity efficiently with the goal to produce a strong return on equity and a strong return on tangible equity to support opportunities for franchise growth. Long run growth in dividends and in both book value and tangible book value per share are also viewed as elements for shareholder value creation. A sound capital structure reduces risk and enhances shareholder return and access to\ncapital markets to support the Company's banking activities and the markets that it serves. In its payment of dividends, management of treasury shares, issuance of equity compensation, and balancing of capital sources, the Company strives to achieve a capital structure that is attractive to the investment community and which satisfies the policy and supervision purposes of the Company's regulators. When Berkshire negotiates business combinations, it generally targets to use its common shares as a significant component of merger consideration and to balance the mix of cash and stock to arrive at targeted capital metrics based on the characteristics of the combined banks. All of the Company's outstanding equity is owned by common stockholders and its stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition to shares held in Treasury, a Bank subsidiary also owns 169 thousand Berkshire shares as a result of the conversion of Hampden shares, and these shares are also excluded from shares outstanding.\nShareholders' equity increased by $178 million, or 25%, to $887 million in 2015, including $157 million issued for the acquisitions and $27 million in retained earnings. Total shares outstanding increased by 5.791 million, or 23%, to 30.974 million. Book value per share increased by 2% to $28.64 from $28.17. Both acquisitions were modestly dilutive to tangible book value per share as discussed in a later section, but retained earnings were sufficient to boost tangible book value per share by 4% to $17.84 from $17.19. The acquisitions were accretive to the Company's capital ratios, and there was an increase in the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets to 7.4% from 7.0%. Tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by investors and it excludes goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company was within the range of 7 - 8% that it generally targets for this measure and also considers its return on tangible equity as a source of capital strength for improving its condition and supporting its growth. The ratio of equity to assets also increased to 11.3% from 10.9% and the Company's risk based capital ratio improved to 11.9% from 11.4%. The Company's goal is to remain eligible for the regulatory designation of Well Capitalized for the Company and the Bank.\nCOMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nSummary: Berkshire's 2015 results included the Hampden operations acquired in April and the Firestone operations acquired in August. As a result, most measures of revenue, expense, income, and average balances increased compared to 2014. In some cases, this report refers to annualized fourth quarter results to indicate the run rate of operations including the fully integrated acquired businesses.\nAs noted previously, Berkshire uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted net income to supplement its evaluation of its operating results. Adjusted net income excludes certain amounts not viewed as related to ongoing operations. These items are primarily related to acquisitions and restructuring expenses, together with gains recorded on securities and investments in acquired banks. Berkshire views its net acquisition related costs as part of the economic investment for its acquisitions. These investments are intended to contribute to long term earnings growth and franchise value.\n2015 results demonstrated a rebound from lower profitability in 2014. The adjusted return on assets increased to 0.85% in the fourth quarter of 2015 from a low of 0.71% in the second quarter of 2014. This included the benefit of an increase in the net interest margin to 3.35% from 3.26% for these dates, and an improvement in the efficiency ratio to 60.6% from 63.0%. The GAAP return on assets in these periods was 0.82% and 0.75% respectively, and included net merger and restructuring charges The increase in profitability included the benefit of positive operating leverage produced by growth from acquisitions and business activities. Based on adjusted earnings, the adjusted return on tangible equity measured 12.5% in 2015, which is a level of internal capital generation that supports Berkshire's dividend (36% payout ratio on 2015 adjusted earnings per share) as well as ongoing growth from business activities and further strengthening of the Company's capital metrics. The GAAP return on equity in 2015 was 6.1%.\nRecent results stem from Berkshire's strategy to build profitability and shareholder value through disciplined growth based around the power of its investment in a well-positioned regional franchise and a competitive market position supported by its unique brand and culture. This strategy includes taking advantage of opportunities offered by banks, companies, and teams that are looking for a regional partner to provide the resources necessary to meet market demand economically in light of the regulatory and margin pressures on revenues and earnings. The Company's long term profitability goals include a return on assets exceeding 1% and a double digit return on equity.\nTotal Net Revenue. Berkshire evaluates its top line with the measure of net revenue, which is the sum of net interest income and non-interest income. The Company also evaluates adjusted net revenue in evaluating its operations and the revenue component of its strategies for generating positive operating leverage. Berkshire also measures adjusted revenue per share in evaluating its growth strategies.\nTotal annual net revenue increased by $42 million, or 18%, to $268 million in 2015. Annualized net revenue totaled $284 million in the final quarter of the year, when both acquisitions were fully integrated. Annual results included a 20% increase in\nnet interest income and a 14% increase in non-interest income. Fee income decreased to 21% of net interest and fee income in 2015 from 23% in 2014. Berkshire's long term goal is to increase fee income to 30% of total revenue by increasing wallet share through cross sales, product expansion, and balance sheet management. The decrease in the fee income contribution in 2015 was due to the lower fee product penetration of the acquired businesses. Berkshire believes that these acquired operations present fee revenue synergy opportunities that may be developed in the future. Both acquisitions were funded significantly with stock consideration, and fourth quarter annualized revenue per share decreased to $9.25 in 2015 from $9.77 in 2014. The acquired businesses reported $39 million in annualized net revenue in the first quarter of 2015, the final reported quarter prior to acquisition. These acquired revenues contributed most of the Company's revenue growth during the year, and totaled $6.93 per share based on the 5.6 million shares issued as merger consideration. Due to their higher profitability after cost saves at Hampden and improved funding costs at Firestone, both of these businesses were expected to contribute a double digit return on equity to future results.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income is the primary contributor to revenue. Berkshire targets growth in net interest income based on increased business volumes related to market share gains in its markets. Pricing disciplines for loans and deposits target a balance of market share and profitability objectives, while taking into account credit, liquidity, and interest rate sensitivity objectives. The Company also borrows to fund an investment portfolio to contribute to income and profitability, together with other balance sheet objectives. Acquired assets and liabilities are marked to market for carrying value and yield, and balance sheet adjustments are often made at or following the acquisition date to integrate the acquired balance sheet with the Company's balance sheet. In 2015, the most significant adjustment was the replacement of Firestone's borrowings with lower cost brokered time deposits as the primary funding source for that operation. Net interest income includes significant components related to the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and deferred items. The most significant component is purchased loan accretion related to recoveries on the resolution of acquired impaired assets, where Berkshire has regularly posted significant gains that are included in net interest income. These gains are difficult to forecast and are highly variable from quarter to quarter, and generally reflect the Company's strong asset management capabilities and continued strong demand for higher yielding assets in the ongoing low rate environment.\nAnnual net interest income increased by $35 million, or 20%, in 2015. This included the benefit of an 18% increase in average earning assets as well as an increase in the net interest margin. The growth in earning assets was previously discussed in the changes in financial condition regarding loans and investments, and included the benefit of acquisitions and business activities. Fourth quarter annualized net interest income increased by $48 million, or 26%, to $235 million. The annualized net interest income of the acquired operations was $35 million in their final quarterly reported operations.\nThe net interest margin was generally declining through 2014 and then expanded in 2015, primarily due to the contribution of the acquired operations. The full year net interest margin increased to 3.31% in 2015 from 3.26% in 2014. The expansion mostly reflected higher yields on commercial loans (due to the acquisitions and the remix of the commercial portfolio) which was partially offset by lower yields on mortgages and consumer loans due to yield compression in the ongoing low rate environment. The improved margin also reflected a modest lengthening of asset durations and shortening of liability durations. The net interest margin was 3.35% in the final quarter of 2015. The Company's goal is to maintain the margin in its business activities but the overall margin is expected to decrease modestly as a result of the additional cost of the forward interest rate swaps that become effective in 2016 as well as less benefit from purchased loan accretion as the portfolio of purchased credit impaired loans is further reduced from ongoing collections activities. The Company's goal is to maintain volume growth and market share improvement that will produce overall growth in net interest income despite possible margin tightening from these factors. As discussed in the following section on Market Risk, the Company expects that there will be ongoing market pressures on the net interest margin if the low interest rate environment persists and if the yield curve flattens, and it is positioned with a target to benefit if interest rates increase from the historic lows seen in recent years.\nThe contribution of purchased loan accretion to net interest income was $7.6 million in 2015, including $2.4 million in the final quarter of the year. This accretion was $6.7 million in 2014. For the above respective periods, the net interest margin measured before purchased loan accretion was 3.19%, 3.22%, and 3.16% respectively. Most purchased loan accretion results from recoveries on the resolution of purchased credit impaired loans resulting from bank mergers. The fair market value of these loans is normally significantly discounted from the contractual and carrying value at the time of the merger and Berkshire's team has produced significant recoveries of value as a result of its asset management disciplines and improving market conditions for impaired assets as a result of the economic recovery and ongoing low interest rates. At year-end 2015, Berkshire's remaining carrying amount for these loans was $21 million, which was a 47% discount from the contractual balance of $40 million. This discount included a balance of $7 million in accretable discount which was expected to be recorded as interest income through the ongoing performance of these loans. The new impaired loans acquired as a result of the Hampden and Firestone transactions had a total carrying balance of $34 million which had a market discount of 46%, resulting in an $18 million carrying balance for Berkshire.\nNon-Interest Income. Most of Berkshire's non-interest income is fee income, which generally represents business activities with customers in Berkshire's markets. The Company pursues growth in market share and wallet share across its business lines, including banking, insurance, and wealth management. In commercial banking, Berkshire pursues commercial and industrial loans with relationships that provide non-interest bearing demand deposit balances and that utilize fee services including electronic banking and cash management services. Fee income includes revenues related to the sale of interest rate swap derivative securities to commercial customers, as well as gains recorded on the sale of residential mortgages and commercial loans previously held for investment. Other non-interest income includes non-dividend distributions on investment securities, as well as securities gains/losses which the company excludes from its adjusted earnings. Non-interest income is reduced by the amortization of the Company's recorded investment in tax credit investments which generate offsetting benefits to income tax expense.\nFee income increased by $4 million, or 8%, to $57 million in 2015. Fourth quarter annualized fee income increased by $5 million, or 10%, to $57 million, including the $3 million estimated benefit from acquired operations and net of a $10 million increase in annualized tax credit investment amortization charges. Loan related income increased by $2 million to $8 million for the year. This included a $1 million increase in interest rate swap income to $4 million and a $1 million increase in gains on the sale of seasoned loans to $2 million. Mortgage banking income increased by $2 million to $4 million. Both loan related income and mortgage banking income benefited from higher volume due to low interest rates through much of 2015, as illustrated by the 40 basis point decrease in average ten year U.S. treasury rates to 2.14% in 2015 from 2.54% in the prior year. Additionally, the lower rate environment contributed to wider gain on sale spreads for both mortgage banking revenue and seasoned loan sales. Fee income variances for deposit, wealth, and insurance revenues were no greater than 2% from year to year and generally reflected lower margins on increased business volumes, including lower fee revenue penetration in acquired Hampden operations. Deposit related fee income in 2015 totaled $25 million and included $10 million in overdraft charges, $7 million in card related income, and $8 million in all other deposit related revenue. Annualized fourth quarter deposit related fees declined to 0.46% of average deposits in 2015 from 0.53% in 2014 including the impact of lower Hampden related fees. Wealth management fees in 2015 benefited from higher average securities prices which contributed to portfolio values on which these fees are based.\nIn addition to fee income, non-interest income includes other items, as well as securities/gains losses. Other items include the amortization of the carrying balance in tax credit investment projects, which is more than offset by benefits included in income tax expense. The Company's investment in these projects increased in 2015 due to certain redevelopment projects in its markets which include capital gains credits which are recorded at origination based on future expected capital gains income. This amortization, which is a charge against non-interest revenues, increased to $11 million in 2015 from $2 million in the prior year. These projects are discussed in the following section on income tax expense. Other items included in non-interest income in 2015 were $4 million in accrued income on bank owned life insurance policies and $1 million in distributions on investments. Securities gains/losses in both years consisted of gains on equity securities offset by bond losses. Stock gains totaled $4 million in 2015 as discussed in the earlier section on Investment Securities. In 2014, a $9 million loss was recorded on the termination of hedges as a result of the New York branch purchase; this loss was already recorded in equity and the income statement charge had no direct impact on total equity when it was recorded.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by the Company. The level of the allowance is a critical accounting estimate, which is subject to uncertainty. The level of the allowance was included in the discussion of financial condition. The provision for loan losses totaled $17 million in 2015, compared to $15 million in 2014. The provision for loan losses exceeded net loan charge-offs in both years, and resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses related primarily to growth in the loan portfolio during the year.\nNon-Interest Expense. Berkshire's goal is to generate positive operating leverage, growing revenues through market share expansion and maintaining expense management disciplines. Non-interest expense increases have generally been related to the Company's growth, including the impact of acquisitions. The Company also invests in building its infrastructure and adding to its market teams, with a focus on fee generating business lines, as part of its long term strategy to occupy a leading position as a regional provider in its footprint. Expense results also include merger and restructuring costs which the Company excludes from its measure of adjusted earnings. The Company views merger related costs as part of the economic investment in acquired businesses. Restructuring costs have included the write-off of uneconomic contracted costs including contracts of acquired operations, as well as ongoing costs to optimize the branch network in light of market changes for branch services based on the emergence of mobile banking as well as changes in customer access patterns.\nTotal non-interest expense increased by $31 million, or 19%, in 2015. Excluding merger and restructuring costs, these expenses increased by $22 million, or 14%. This increase included $16 million in operating expenses of the acquired operations based on their final reported results in the first quarter of 2015. Cost saves related to acquisitions and to restructuring are important\nelements of the Company's strategies related to efficiency and return on equity. Based on their final reported results, annualized operating expenses totaled $17 million for Hampden and $10 million for Firestone. The Company believes that it achieved its goal of 35% cost saves for Hampden by the end of 2015. The Company did not target any cost saves for Firestone except for reducing borrowing costs, which are an element of net interest income and were achieved.\nThe efficiency ratio improved to 61.3% from 63.2% as the Company pursues its goal to reduce this ratio below 60%. The efficiency ratio improved to 60.6% in the final quarter of the year including Hampden cost saves. The fourth quarter ratio of adjusted non-interest expense to average assets decreased to 2.43% in 2015 from 2.49% in 2014.\nExpense growth in 2015 was mostly in the primary operating expense components of compensation, occupancy, and technology due to the acquisitions and growth in business activities. Full time equivalent staff totaled 1,221 at year-end 2015, a 12% increase from 1,091 a year earlier, including staff related to acquired operations.\nMerger and restructuring expense totaled $18 million in 2015, compared to $8 million in the prior year. These expenses in 2015 included $11 million related to Hampden, $2 million related to Firestone, and $5 million related to restructuring including the 8 branches that were consolidated or sold. Berkshire has consistently focused on managing its branch network in recent years through a combination of consolidations, closings, sales and relocations, as well as purchasing branches and open de novo offices. In 2014, merger costs included $4 million for the New York branch acquisition and $2 million for Hampden, and restructuring costs totaled $2 million. Merger related costs primarily consist of severance costs, contract termination charges, professional fees, and variable compensation costs.\nIncome Tax Expense. Berkshire utilizes several tax strategies which allow the Company to operate in a tax effective manner and deliver tax savings. As a result, the Company's effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate based on the federal and state income taxes in its market area. The Company participates in federal and state tax credit programs and other tax advantaged investment opportunities which are encouraged under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has also established security corporation subsidiaries and, through its subsidiaries, purchases tax exempt bonds. In 2014, the Company increased its resources in its tax management function and is pursuing additional opportunities to develop tax effective strategies which will deliver additional tax benefits and tax savings based on its expanded footprint and operating activities.\nBerkshire increased its ownership in investment tax credit entities as an aspect of its overall operating and financial strategy for building customer relationships, supporting its communities, and contributing to profitability. In 2015, the company recorded a $16 million reduction in the income tax provision related to tax credits and deductions generated primarily from investment in historic rehabilitation and low income housing projects. The company recorded an $11 million reduction in the carrying balance as a corresponding charge against non-interest income, with a $5 million resulting net contribution to net income. In 2014, there was a $2.3 million reduction in the tax provision and a $1.5 million charge against non-interest income, resulting in a $0.8 million net contribution to net income. As a result of the tax credit program, the Company's effective income tax rate decreased to 9% in 2015 from 26% in 2014. Measured before the tax credit benefit, the effective income tax rate was 32% in 2015, compared to 30% in 2014. In addition to the tax credit benefit, the Company's effective tax rate also benefits from its investments in municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance.\nAt year-end 2015, the company's other assets included a $3 million unamortized balance of the company's equity ownership interest in these entities. A deferred tax asset related to these programs includes a $3 million federal tax credit carryforward from past investment in new markets and renewable energy projects. The tax credit carryforward is expected to be realized in the future based on the company's ability to generate sufficient future ordinary operating income. The company recorded an additional $3 million deferred tax asset with respect to future expected capital losses from investment in historic rehabilitation and low income housing projects. This is the Company's first significant utilization of capital gain related tax benefits and realization of those benefits depends on realization of projected future capital gains. The company expects to realize the tax benefit from these capital losses in the future based on the company's ability to generate future capital gain income from a variety of sources. Investment tax credit programs depend on federal tax policy and administrative rulings and the future availability of such programs depends on future policy and administrative processes.\nThe Company reports adjusted earnings per share excluding specified items. The effective tax rate on these adjusted earnings per share was estimated to be 15% in 2015. This rate was higher than the 9% GAAP tax rate in 2015 due to the lower proportionate benefit of tax advantaged items compared to the estimated adjusted pretax income. The 15% rate was lower than the 30% equivalent rate in 2014 due to the increased tax credit benefits recorded in 2015. The Company expects that the tax rate on adjusted earnings per share will revert back to the 2014 levels at the beginning of 2016. The Company expects to record additional tax credit benefits in the second half of 2016 as a result of additional investments in related projects, with the result that the full year rate on adjusted earnings is expected to be below 30%. The anticipated merger expenses for 44 Business\nCapital are not significant and therefore the expected GAAP effective tax rate in 2016 is not expected to be significantly different from the rate on adjusted earnings, based on conditions known at the start of the year.\nHampden Bancorp Acquisition. The Hampden acquisition was completed on April 17, 2015. Hampden was a community bank headquartered in Springfield, Massachusetts and serving the Springfield area. This in-market merger was targeted to benefit all constituencies, bringing additional products and services to the Hampden customers, providing revenue synergies and cost efficiencies to the combined operations, and boosting Berkshire's Springfield deposit share in the Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area to the top 4 position based on most recent data. Berkshire is the largest Massachusetts based bank now serving the Springfield market. Berkshire consolidated 3 of the Hampden branches in the second quarter and now operates a total of 17 branches in that market, including 7 former Hampden offices.\nThe total acquisition cost was $114 million and Berkshire issued 4.2 million common shares as merger consideration, net of 169 thousand shares held by Berkshire. Merger related costs included $8 million in pre-tax merger related costs recorded by Hampden and $11 million recorded by Berkshire. The Company believes that it achieved its goal of 35% cost saves by the end of 2015. The Company has also consolidated three Hampden branches and recorded non-operating restructuring charges in 2015 for these consolidations. The Company estimates that Hampden's operations contributed to improvements in its operating profitability ratios and that these operations will provide additional accretion to earnings in 2016 based on a full year of integrated operations including all targeted cost saves.\nDue to the stock issued as merger consideration, the Company estimates that the Hampden acquisition improved the ratio of tangible equity/tangible assets and also contributed positively to regulatory capital ratios. The merger was estimated as $0.33 dilutive to Berkshire's tangible book value per share. The Company estimated that the acquired operations contributed $0.02 to earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2015, including estimated 35% cost saves which were completed in the fourth quarter. The Company continues to target tangible book value dilution payback within approximately 3 years from the merger date based on merger related adjusted EPS accretion. The Company also continues to target double digit long run return on the equity invested in this acquisition.\nFirestone Financial Acquisition. The Firestone acquisition was completed on August 7, 2015. Based in Needham,\nMassachusetts, Firestone is a longstanding profitable commercial specialty finance company providing secured installment loan equipment financing for small and medium-sized businesses. Firestone lends nationally, financing fitness equipment, carnival rides and games, amusement and video entertainment, gaming, vending, laundry, and ATM machines. This acquisition provides revenue diversification to Berkshire and increased opportunities for cross sales of existing Berkshire products and services. This business is viewed as complementary to Berkshire's existing specialized financing businesses, including asset based lending and SBA loan programs. Firestone is being operated as a subsidiary of Berkshire Bank and is maintaining its existing operations with a goal of expanding its programs based on Berkshire's increased capital and financing capabilities.\nFinancial results in 2015 included $2 million in pre-tax Firestone merger related charges. The merger consideration paid to shareholders was $56 million, consisting of approximately 75% stock and 25% cash and the Company issued 1.442 million shares as consideration. The Company estimates that this acquisition was accretive to adjusted earnings per share and profitability metrics, as well as to capital ratios. The Firestone merger was estimated as $0.05 dilutive to the Company's tangible book value per share. Berkshire estimated that Firestone operations contributed $0.01 to earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was the first full quarter of combined operations. No cost saves were targeted for this business combination. The Company's goal is that Firestone's operations will produce a double digit return on its equity investment and tangible book value dilution will be repaid from Firestone's operating earnings accretion in 2.5 years.\nResults of Segment and Parent Operations. In prior periods, the Company reported two subsidiary operating segments - banking and insurance. Due to growth in the banking segment, the Company determined that as of fiscal year end 2015 it has only one segment based on accounting principles. Accordingly, there is no disclosure of segment and parent operations except for the note in the financial statements regarding the parent. Results for Berkshire Bank in 2015 generally followed the levels and trends of consolidated results. Insurance net income increased modestly in 2015, as earnings benefited from expense reductions that exceeded the modest decrease in revenue.\nTotal Comprehensive Income. Berkshire's total comprehensive income in 2015 was $40 million, compared to $49 million in the prior year. The $16 million increase in net income was offset by a $25 million decrease in other comprehensive income due primarily to a net $22 million after-tax change in available for sale securities from an unrealized gain in 2014 to an unrealized loss in 2015. The change in securities fair value was discussed in an earlier section of this report. The increase in the unrealized loss on the Company's forward starting interest rate swaps on borrowings also contributed to the decrease in other comprehensive income in 2015.\nQuarterly Results. Quarterly results for 2015 and 2014 are presented in a note to the consolidated financial statements. Quarterly results were affected by the revenue downturn in 2013 and subsequent actions to improve profitability. Quarterly results have also been affected by purchased loan accretion and by merger and restructuring related net costs. The Company also evaluates adjusted earnings on a quarterly basis to supplement its understanding of operating trends. Based on these evaluations, the Company believed that its adjusted results on a per share basis improved sequentially in all quarters in 2014 and 2015 except for the fourth quarter of 2015 when adjusted results were flat. Similarly, operating profitability determined on an adjusted basis improved throughout 2014 and 2015, although not yet back to levels prevailing at the start of 2013.\nIn 2015, quarterly revenue and expense reflected the Hampden acquisition on April 17 and the Firestone acquisition on August 7. Results also reflected the increased benefit of tax credit related investments beginning in the first quarter. By the fourth quarter, all acquired operations were fully integrated and the Company estimated that it completed the planned Hampden cost saves during the quarter. As a result, fourth quarter operations were generally reflective of the Company's current run rate including the acquired operations. In the preceding discussion of 2015 results, references have been made to fourth quarter adjusted results to demonstrate the full benefit of the year's actions.\nIn 2014, revenue and expense increased in the first quarter due to the addition of the acquired New York branches. First quarter non-interest income and expense were significantly affected by merger related net charges. As a result, the Company recorded a net loss in the first quarter. Total revenue increased sequentially in each of the next three quarters as business volume growth more than offset a gradual tightening in the net interest margin due to changes in purchased loan accretion and ongoing asset yield compression. The net interest margin increased to 3.23% from 3.20% in the final quarter. Excluding non-operating charges, non-interest expense was generally flat through mid-year. Adjusted expenses increased due to growth in the fourth quarter, and the Company also recorded merger charges related to the pending acquisition of Hampden Bancorp. As a result, net income decreased slightly in the final quarter after rising in the second and third quarters. Fourth quarter net income of $0.46 per share was 10% higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the ongoing benefit of positive operating leverage generated by revenue growth driven by higher volumes.\nCOMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013\nSummary: Berkshire's results in 2014 included the New York branch operations acquired on January 17, 2014. As a result, many measures of revenue, expense, income, and average balances increased compared to prior periods. In 2013, changes in market conditions resulted in a downturn in mortgage banking revenue and accelerated runoff of acquired impaired and non-relationship loans. Quarterly earnings per share decreased to $0.33 in the third quarter of 2013 from $0.48 in the second quarter of 2013. Management reorganized and restructured its expenses in the second half of the 2013, and quarterly earnings improved to $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. Berkshire leveraged its expanded footprint in 2014 with the New York branch purchase and strong loan growth, and earnings per share improved further to $0.46 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted earnings per share advanced to $0.48 in this quarter, which was a 20% improvement from $0.40 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2014, the Company developed revenue synergies, operating efficiencies, and improved product and service capabilities based on the combination of its larger footprint and enhanced infrastructure. Full year net income totaled $33.7 million, or $1.36 per share, in 2014 compared to $41.1 million, or $1.65 per share, in the prior year. These full year changes were the result of the quarterly changes discussed above. Berkshire's adjusted net income measured $1.80 per share in 2014, which was down slightly from $1.87 in the prior year. As noted above, quarterly operating results had rebounded significantly by the end of 2014 while not yet fully recovering to the level of earnings prior to the revenue decline around midyear 2013. The return on equity in the final quarter of 2014 improved to 6.5% and the return on assets improved to 0.71%.\nTotal Net Revenue. Total net revenue was approximately $226 million in both 2014 and 2013. Annualized net revenue improved to $243 million in the final quarter of 2014, or $9.77 per share. Excluding net securities gains, this represented an increase of 17%, or $35 million, from annualized net revenue in the final quarter of 2013 and was also a 3% increase over the similar measure in 2012. The growth in 2014 included approximately $16 million in anticipated revenue benefit from the acquired New York branches as well as approximately $5 million in benefit from lower borrowing costs related to the hedge termination. Management estimated that fourth quarter revenue increased by approximately 8% from organic growth and business expansion in 2014 from 2013 including volume related increases in both net interest income and fee revenue.\nNet Interest Income. Gross interest income increased by $3 million, or 2%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The average balance of earning assets increased by 18%, which was mostly offset by a decrease in the net interest margin to 3.26% in 2014 from 3.63% in 2013. Total loan interest income decreased by $12 million, or 6%, but this was more than offset by a $15 million, or 85%, increase in securities and other interest income as acquired New York deposits were initially used to fund growth in the securities portfolio. The decrease in loan interest income was due to lower average yields. While average loan balances increased by 11%, the average loan yield decreased to 3.98% in 2014 from 4.69% in 2013. By the fourth quarter, yield\ncompression had decreased and based on ongoing volume growth, fourth quarter loan interest income increased by 5% over the same period in 2013.\nPurchased loan accretion totaled $6.7 million in 2014, which was down significantly from $18.1 million in 2013 due to the seasoning of the portfolio. Purchased impaired loans totaled $14 million at year-end 2014, which was 54% of the contractual balance of $26 million of these loans. The unamortized balance of net accretable yield on impaired loans was $2.5 million at year-end 2014 compared to $2.6 million at the start of the year.\nThe overall yield on earning assets decreased to 3.73% in the fourth quarter of 2014 from 3.97% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding purchased loan accretion, the yield decreased to 3.62% from 3.73%. The cost of funds decreased to 0.52% from 0.73% including the benefit of the hedge terminations in the first quarter. Through its balance sheet management, Berkshire was able to offset the earning asset yield compression so that the fourth quarter 2014 net interest margin of 3.23% was only down by 0.03% compared to 3.26% in 2013. Excluding purchased loan accretion, the fourth quarter margin improved to 3.12% from 3.07% in those same periods.\nNon-Interest Income. Fee income increased by $3 million, or 6%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Fourth quarter fee income increased by $2 million, or 17%, from year to year. This included an estimated $1 million related to the branch purchase and $1 million related to all other factors. All major categories of fee income were up year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to Berkshire's growth. For the full year, most categories were up except for mortgage banking fee income and other loan related fee income. Due to a spike in interest rates, mortgage banking revenues declined sharply around midyear 2013 from elevated levels that have not recurred and are not expected to recur.\nDeposit related fees increased by $6 million, or 34%, to $25 million in 2014, including an estimated $4 million related to the New York branch acquisition. These branches acquired from a national bank had a higher rate of fee income generation compared to the Company's existing deposits. Accordingly, the annualized ratio of deposit fee income to average deposits increased to 0.54% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 0.48% in the same quarter of the prior year. Deposit fees in 2014 included $10 million in overdraft income, $8 million in card fee income, and $7 million in service charge income.\nMortgage banking income decreased by 51% to $2.6 million in 2014 from $5.2 million in the prior year. Berkshire's mortgage banking revenue is recorded on interest rate lock commitments related to loans originated for sale. The volume of these commitments was $304 million in 2014. The Company recorded 2.12% in gross revenue on these commitments and 0.84% net of direct costs of origination in 2014. Wealth management revenue increased by 10% in 2014 to $9.5 million from $8.7 million, including the benefit of higher market prices for assets under management. Total wealth assets under management increased to $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion in 2014.\nIn addition to fee revenues, non-interest income included an $8.8 million loss recorded on the termination of hedges in 2014 and net securities gains totaling $4.8 million in 2013. The securities gains in 2013 were primarily related to the sale of bank equity securities to realize strong market appreciation on these securities. The hedge termination loss in 2014 was a result of the branch acquisition and is further described in the notes to the financial statements. This loss was the recognition of a fair value loss already recorded in equity and therefore had no direct impact on shareholders' equity when it was recorded.\nAll other non-interest income totaled $2.6 million in 2014 and $2.9 million in 2013. Results in 2014 included $3.1 million recorded for the accrual of earnings on bank owned life insurance and were net of $1.5 million in charges representing the book loss on tax shelter investments. These losses are more than offset by tax credit benefits as described in the later section on income tax expense.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses totaled $15.0 million in 2014, compared to $11.4 million in 2013. The provision for loan losses exceeded net loan charge-offs in both years, and resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses related to growth in the loan portfolio during the year.\nNon-Interest Expense. Total non-interest expense increased by $9 million, or 5%, in 2014. The Company estimated that it added approximately $13 million in annual expense related to the New York branch purchase. Total merger, restructuring, and conversion expense decreased by $6 million to $8 million in 2014. The Company estimated that total non-interest expense increased approximately 2% before the impacts of the branch purchase and the changes in merger, restructuring, and conversion expense. Total non-interest expense decreased to 2.69% of average assets in 2014 from 2.97% in 2013. The Company's non-GAAP measure of adjusted non-interest expense decreased to 2.55% of assets from 2.68 for these respective periods, and decreased further to 2.49 in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nExpense growth was mostly in the primary operating expense components of compensation, occupancy, and technology. In total, these costs increased by $17 million, or 16 %, in 2014. Excluding the costs related to the acquired branches, these costs were up an estimated 3% for the year. All other operating costs were down $1.3 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a $2.4 million decrease in professional services from elevated levels in 2013.\nMerger and restructuring expense totaling $8.5 million in 2014 included $5.4 million in merger charges related primarily to the branch acquisition, including professional fees and integration costs with related compensation. Restructuring expenses totaled $3.1 million and included charges related to the Bank's charter change in the third quarter, together with costs for financial systems and certain branch closings and property liquidations. The higher $14.8 million in costs in 2013 were due primarily to the integration of the acquired operations of Beacon Federal Bancorp and the enterprise expense restructuring project that was initiated in the third quarter of that year.\nFull time equivalent staff totaled 1,091 at year-end 2014, compared to 939 at the prior year-end. This increase included an estimated 92 positions related to the acquired New York branch operations and an additional 6% increase in total staff related to the Company's business growth and expansion, including targeted investment in commercial, retail and wealth management market teams.\nIncome Tax Expense. The effective income tax rate of 26% in 2014 was lower than the 29% rate in 2013, including the higher proportionate benefit of tax preference items in 2014 that resulted from the decrease in pre-tax income from year-to-year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was estimated to be 30% in 2014 and 31% in 2013. In both years, this rate was higher than GAAP tax rate due to the lower proportionate benefit of tax preference items compared to the higher adjusted pre-tax income, which excluded net charges related to merger, restructuring, and other designated expense items.\nLIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash needs at all times with available cash and from established external liquidity sources or by conversion of other assets to cash at a reasonable price and in a timely manner. Berkshire evaluates liquidity at the holding company and on a consolidated basis, which is primarily a function of the Bank's liquidity.\nThe primary liquidity need at the holding company is to support its capital structure, including shareholder dividends and debt service. Additionally, the holding company uses cash to support certain organizational expenses, stock purchases and buybacks, merger related costs, and limited business functions that cannot be performed at the Bank or the insurance subsidiary. The holding company primarily relies on dividends from the Bank to meet its ongoing cash needs. The holding company generally expects to maintain cash on hand equivalent to normal cash uses, including common stock dividends, for at least a one year period. Sources and uses of cash at the parent are reported in the condensed financial statements of the parent company included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. There are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Bank as discussed in the Stockholders' Equity note to the consolidated financial statements. As of year-end 2015, the statutory limit on future dividend payments by the Bank totaled $68 million. This amount is based on retained earnings of the Bank and is expected to be supplemented by future bank earnings in accordance with the statutory formula.\nAt year-end 2015, the holding company had $36 million in cash and equivalents, compared to $31 million at the start of the year. The Parent's cash is held on deposit in the Bank. The Bank paid $28 million in dividends to the holding company in 2015, which was an increase from $12 million in 2014, when the Bank retained more earnings to support the New York branch purchase. Dividends to the holding company from the insurance subsidiary totaled $6 million in 2015, and no such dividends were paid in 2014. The holding company has a $10 million unsecured line of credit, which was fully utilized at the start of 2015 and which was unused at year-end 2015.\nThe Bank's primary ongoing source of liquidity is customer deposits and the main use of liquidity is the funding of loans and lending commitments. Additional routine sources are borrowings, repayments of loans and investment securities, and the sale of investment securities. The Bank targets to grow customer deposits by increasing its market share among its regions in order to sustain loan growth as a primary component of its strategy. Deposit strategies also consider relative deposit costs as well as relationship and market share objectives. The Bank's acquisition strategy is also targeted to supplement business activities including bank acquisitions and acquisitions of branches, such as the 2014 New York branch purchase. Additionally, the Bank has expanded its use of wholesale funding sources, including borrowings and brokered time deposits. The Company monitors the loans/deposits ratio in assessing directional changes in its liquidity, and in the past has allowed this metric to reach levels near 110% depending on the timing of business activity, while generally keeping it closer to 100% as a working target. The Company also monitors the levels of its wholesale funding in relationship to total assets. Brokered deposits can be more volatile than customer deposits depending on Company and economic events. FHLBB borrowings are in the context of standard, long-term FHLB programs but overall availability is constrained by collateral tests. The Company also monitors the liquidity of\ninvestment securities and portfolio loans and has increased its active management of the loan portfolio to accomplish Company objectives, including liquidity goals. The Bank relies on its borrowings availability with the FHLBB for routine operating liquidity, and has other overnight borrowing relationships for contingency liquidity purposes. In 2015, the Bank increased its pledging of investment securities to support municipal deposits and its use of two way reciprocal money market accounts to provide additional deposit assurance to institutional customers following its termination in the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund. The Bank also expanded its interest rate swaps with national counterparties to provide fixed interest instruments to large commercial borrowers. The Bank has strengthened its liquidity planning and management processes in conjunction with its overall growth and regulatory expectations.\nIn 2015, the Bank's primary uses of funds were loan growth and the replacement of Firestone's borrowings and the primary source of funds were brokered deposits. During the year, the Bank shifted more of its assets into the FHLBB collateral pool, including acquired Hampden assets which Hampden had used for similar purposes. Total FHLBB unused borrowing availability was $576 million at year-end, compared to $246 million at the start of the year.\nThe Bank utilizes the mortgage secondary market as a source of funds for residential mortgages which are sold into that market. This business volume expanded in 2015 as a result of higher residential mortgage demand. Secondary market counterparties include federal mortgage agencies and national financial institutions. The secondary market for jumbo mortgages has been limited in recent years and these mortgages have become more prevalent in the Bank's originations mix. The majority of these loan originations were retained on the Bank's books in 2015. Over the last two years, the Bank has also increased its wholesale purchases and sales of loans including residential mortgages, consumer loans, and commercial loans and loan participations. Commercial loan growth has also included purchases of participations in syndicated loan transactions. These participations are variable rate and the Company views these assets as more liquid and saleable through secondary market channels.\nUnder the Enhanced Prudential Standards which became effective under federal regulation at midyear in 2014, the largest banks are required to adopt a number of practices to manage and reduce liquidity risk. These standards do not apply directly to Berkshire but are affecting U.S. deposit markets. In some circumstances, these standards increase the attractiveness of retail deposits and decrease the attractiveness of large commercial deposits for the largest banks, and these changes may affect the competitive conditions that evolve based on these new standards. Including the acquired Hampden deposits, the Bank's estimate of its total deposit balances which exceed FDIC insurance limits increased to $1.34 billion, or 24% of total deposits at year-end 2015 from $1.07 billion, or 23%, at the start of the year.\nThe greatest sources of uncertainty affecting liquidity are deposit withdrawals and usage of loan commitments, which are influenced by interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Due to the unusual and prolonged low interest rate environment, there is uncertainty about the behavior of deposits if interest rates increase at some future time as is anticipated. The Company believes that its market positioning and relationship focus will generally enhance the stability of its deposits, and it also models various scenarios for the purpose of contingency liquidity planning. The Bank relies on competitive rates, customer service, and long-standing relationships with customers to manage deposit and loan liquidity. Based on its historical experience, management believes that it has adequately provided for deposit and loan liquidity needs. Both liquidity and capital resources are managed according to policies approved by the Board of Directors and executive management and the Board reviews liquidity metrics and contingency plans on a regular basis. The Bank actively manages all aspects of its balance sheet to achieve its objectives for earnings, liquidity, asset quality, interest rate risk, and capital.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company and the Bank target to maintain sufficient capital to qualify for the Well Capitalized\u201d designation by federal regulators. Berkshire's goal is to use capital efficiently to achieve its objective to become a higher performance company with a targeted return on equity exceeding 10%. A double digit return on equity is used to benchmark all lending and investment programs, together with all acquisition analyses. The Company seeks to maintain a competitive cost of capital and capital structure. The Company generally targets to maintain a ratio of tangible equity/tangible assets in the range of 7-8%.\nBerkshire views its internal return on tangible capital as the primary capital resource of the Company. The return on tangible equity has improved, and measured 12.7% in the final quarter of 2015 based on the measure of adjusted earnings. The Company's long term target is a 15% return on tangible equity. A return at or above current levels provides resources for maintaining competitive dividend payouts while also internally supporting strong growth from business activities while maintaining and improving capital metrics.\nThe Bank has acquired banks and fee based businesses in recent years. Berkshire's goal is that its stock is the primary capital resource for merger consideration. The Hampden acquisition was 100% for stock and Firestone was 75%. The pending 44 Business Capital acquisition has a small stock component. Through active investor relations, the Company's goal is to maintain a solid profile with the investment community for the purposes of supporting outstanding capital and raising other capital as opportunities arise. The Company has an ongoing universal shelf registration with the SEC to facilitate capital issuances. The Company issued common and preferred stock in the past, as well as senior and subordinated debt.\nThe Risk Management and Capital Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight of Berkshire's capital management and plans. The Company is deepening its capital analytics and stress testing capabilities as it grows toward the $10 billion federal regulatory threshold under the Dodd-Frank legislation. While the Company recognizes the potential increased compliance costs and restrictions as growth nears or exceeds that threshold, the Company believes that other size advantages can offset those impacts over time in many markets including its own.\nAVERAGE BALANCES, INTEREST, AVERAGE YIELDS/COST AND RATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS\nTables with the above information are presented in Item 6 of this report.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe year-end 2015 contractual obligations were as follows:\nItem 7 - 7A - Table 1 - Contractual Obligations\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than One\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to Three\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to Five\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After Five\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLBB borrowings (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,174,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,123,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,429,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,151,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________\nAcquisition related obligations are not included.\n(1) Consists of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The maturities extend through 2027 and the rates vary by borrowing.\n(2) Consists of leases, bank branches and ATMs through 2039.\n(3) Consists of obligations with multiple vendors to purchase a broad range of services.\nFurther information about borrowings and lease obligations is in the notes on borrowings and commitments to the financial statements.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nIn the normal course of operations, Berkshire engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in the Company's financial statements. The Company views these transactions as ordinary to its business activities and its assessment is that there are no material changes in these arrangements at year-end 2015 compared to year-end 2014. As previously reported in the discussion of changes in financial condition, Berkshire has outstanding derivative financial instruments and engages in hedging activities, and the fair value of these contracts is recorded on the balance sheet. As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, at year-end 2015, Berkshire had an outstanding agreement to acquire 44 Business Capital, subject to customary regulatory approvals. The Company expects to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of 2016.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe most significant fair value measurements recorded by the Company are those related to assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. These measurements are discussed further in the mergers and acquisitions note to the consolidated financial statements.\nBerkshire provides a summary of estimated fair values of financial instruments at each quarter-end. The premium or discount value of loans has historically been the most significant element of this presentation. This discount is a Level 3 estimate and reflects management's subjective judgments. At year-end 2015, the premium value of the loan portfolio was $42 million, or 0.7% of carrying value. The premium value is down from $50 million, or 1.1% of carrying value at year-end 2014. This decrease reflected the impact of the acquired loans recorded at fair value and higher year-end interest rates and spreads, offsetting the benefit of improved asset quality.\nThe Company makes further measurements of fair value of certain assets and liabilities, as described in the related note in the financial statements. The most significant measurements of recurring fair values of financial instruments primarily relate to securities available for sale and derivative instruments. These measurements were included in the previous discussion of changes in financial condition, and were generally based on Level 2 market based inputs. Non-recurring fair value measurements primarily relate to impaired loans, capitalized mortgage servicing rights, and other real estate owned. When measurement is required, these measures are generally based on Level 3 inputs.\nFinancial instruments comprise the majority of the Company assets and liabilities. The net combined fair value of those instruments contributes to the economic value of the Company's equity. This net premium value of financial instruments increased by $108 million to $506 million in 2015, reflecting the benefit of the tangible equity contributed by the acquisitions plus the increase in retained earnings, and less the impact of the lower premium related to loans. Instruments acquired in business combinations were recorded at fair value at acquisition date. These measures do not take into account the non-interest income generated by these customer relationships or the long term intangible value of the Company's franchise in its markets.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nThe financial statements and related financial data presented in this Form 10-K have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Bank are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Bank's performance than the general level of inflation. Interest rates may be affected by inflation, but the direction and magnitude of the impact may vary. A sudden change in inflation (or expectations about inflation), with a related change in interest rates, would have a significant impact on our operations.\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nPlease refer to the notes on Recently Adopted Accounting Principles and Future Application of Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "Income Tax Expense. The effective income tax rate of 26% in 2014 was lower than the 29% rate in 2013, including the higher proportionate benefit of tax preference items in 2014 that resulted from the decrease in pre-tax income from year-to-year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was estimated to be 30% in 2014 and 31% in 2013. In both years, this rate was higher than GAAP tax rate due to the lower proportionate benefit of tax preference items compared to the higher adjusted pre-tax income, which excluded net charges related to merger, restructuring, and other designated expense items.\nBerkshire's near term goal is to generate further revenue driven positive operating leverage to improve profitability. The Company is pursuing initiatives to improve fee revenues and non-interest income and the balance sheet will continue to be managed to support profitability, capital, liquidity, and interest rate risk objectives. At year-end 2015, the Company had a pending agreement to purchase a prominent SBA lender scheduled for the first quarter of 2016, which is expected to contribute to these objectives.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than One\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to Three\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to Five\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After Five\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLBB borrowings (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,174,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,123,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,429,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,151,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs noted previously, Berkshire uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted net income to supplement its evaluation of its operating results. Adjusted net income excludes certain amounts not viewed as related to ongoing operations. These items are primarily related to acquisitions and restructuring expenses, together with gains recorded on securities and investments in acquired banks. Berkshire views its net acquisition related costs as part of the economic investment for its acquisitions. These investments are intended to contribute to long term earnings growth and franchise value.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nLoan Loss Allowance. The determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate. The Company's methodologies for determining the loan loss allowance are discussed in Item 1 of this report, and Item 8 includes further information about the accounting policy for the loan loss allowance and the Company's accounting for the allowance in the consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Most of Berkshire's non-interest income is fee income, which generally represents business activities with customers in Berkshire's markets. The Company pursues growth in market share and wallet share across its business lines, including banking, insurance, and wealth management. In commercial banking, Berkshire pursues commercial and industrial loans with relationships that provide non-interest bearing demand deposit balances and that utilize fee services including electronic banking and cash management services. Fee income includes revenues related to the sale of interest rate swap derivative securities to commercial customers, as well as gains recorded on the sale of residential mortgages and commercial loans previously held for investment. Other non-interest income includes non-dividend distributions on investment securities, as well as securities gains/losses which the company excludes from its adjusted earnings. Non-interest income is reduced by the amortization of the Company's recorded investment in tax credit investments which generate offsetting benefits to income tax expense.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe primary liquidity need at the holding company is to support its capital structure, including shareholder dividends and debt service. Additionally, the holding company uses cash to support certain organizational expenses, stock purchases and buybacks, merger related costs, and limited business functions that cannot be performed at the Bank or the insurance subsidiary. The holding company primarily relies on dividends from the Bank to meet its ongoing cash needs. The holding company generally expects to maintain cash on hand equivalent to normal cash uses, including common stock dividends, for at least a one year period. Sources and uses of cash at the parent are reported in the condensed financial statements of the parent company included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. There are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Bank as discussed in the Stockholders' Equity note to the consolidated financial statements. As of year-end 2015, the statutory limit on future dividend payments by the Bank totaled $68 million. This amount is based on retained earnings of the Bank and is expected to be supplemented by future bank earnings in accordance with the statutory formula.\nBorrowings and Other Liabilities. All of Berkshire's senior borrowings at year-end were provided by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston under established relationship programs. The FHLBB is secured by a general pledge of assets primarily consisting of mortgage backed securities and residential mortgages. The Bank uses FHLBB borrowings to manage overnight liquidity and generally to provide funding for its investment portfolio. Other components of the Bank's wholesale funding program include correspondent banks and brokerages, and brokered deposits. For contingency liquidity purposes, the Bank has short term credit arrangements with the Federal Reserve Bank and with certain national banks and brokerages, and the holding company maintains a line of credit. There has been no regular ongoing use of these arrangements. As previously discussed, over the last two years, the Bank has expanded its use of time deposits raised through established broker relationships to fund a portion of loan growth, as an alternative to borrowed funds. The Company evaluates its use of borrowings and of wholesale funds in general in managing its liquidity and strategic growth plans. This is further discussed in the following section on Liquidity.\nLoans. Berkshire posted loan growth of $1.04 billion, or 22%, to $5.7 billion in 2015, of which 14% was contributed as a result of acquisitions and 8% was due to business activities. Growth from business activities was in residential mortgage loans and commercial loans and was a primary focus of the Company's initiatives to increase earnings and profitability. Business activities included both direct originations in market as well as wholesale transactions with other financial institutions. Strategies included targeted remixing of the portfolio to improve pricing spreads and relationship profitability. Despite the ongoing low rate environment, Berkshire achieved an increase in the fourth quarter loan yield to 4.15% in 2015 compared to 3.96% in 2014. The portfolio was further diversified in 2015 and credit metrics improved and remained comparatively strong. The portfolio duration was lengthened modestly to contribute to the yield objective. Through its executive team expansion, Berkshire continues to strengthen its commercial loan oversight and administration and to adhere to its disciplines for credit underwriting and portfolio management. Changes in the portfolio composition in 2015 included runoff of certain balances where competitive pricing and credit conditions for renewing credits were not consistent with the Company's underwriting and pricing guidelines. Berkshire's asset resolution team has continued to generate significant income through recoveries in its collection and resolution of impaired loans acquired in bank acquisitions.\n(2) Consists of leases, bank branches and ATMs through 2039.\nThe Company has increased its utilization of brokered time deposits over the last two years to better manage deposit costs and interest rate risk, and to diversify its funding of loan portfolio growth. Brokered time deposits increased by $404 million to $784 million in 2015. At year-end, the average maturity of this portfolio was 7 months, with an average cost of 0.70%. Additionally, as a result of its DIF insurance termination, the Company has increased its use of reciprocal money market deposits, which offer full insurance to certain commercial and institutional customers in the Company's markets. These balances increased to $102 million from $9 million during the year and are viewed as components of the Company's relationship deposit balances. Also related to the DIF termination, the Company has increased its pledging of investment\nIn the normal course of operations, Berkshire engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in the Company's financial statements. The Company views these transactions as ordinary to its business activities and its assessment is that there are no material changes in these arrangements at year-end 2015 compared to year-end 2014. As previously reported in the discussion of changes in financial condition, Berkshire has outstanding derivative financial instruments and engages in hedging activities, and the fair value of these contracts is recorded on the balance sheet. As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, at year-end 2015, Berkshire had an outstanding agreement to acquire 44 Business Capital, subject to customary regulatory approvals. The Company expects to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of 2016.\nSummary: Berkshire's results in 2014 included the New York branch operations acquired on January 17, 2014. As a result, many measures of revenue, expense, income, and average balances increased compared to prior periods. In 2013, changes in market conditions resulted in a downturn in mortgage banking revenue and accelerated runoff of acquired impaired and non-relationship loans. Quarterly earnings per share decreased to $0.33 in the third quarter of 2013 from $0.48 in the second quarter of 2013. Management reorganized and restructured its expenses in the second half of the 2013, and quarterly earnings improved to $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. Berkshire leveraged its expanded footprint in 2014 with the New York branch purchase and strong loan growth, and earnings per share improved further to $0.46 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted earnings per share advanced to $0.48 in this quarter, which was a 20% improvement from $0.40 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2014, the Company developed revenue synergies, operating efficiencies, and improved product and service capabilities based on the combination of its larger footprint and enhanced infrastructure. Full year net income totaled $33.7 million, or $1.36 per share, in 2014 compared to $41.1 million, or $1.65 per share, in the prior year. These full year changes were the result of the quarterly changes discussed above. Berkshire's adjusted net income measured $1.80 per share in 2014, which was down slightly from $1.87 in the prior year. As noted above, quarterly operating results had rebounded significantly by the end of 2014 while not yet fully recovering to the level of earnings prior to the revenue decline around midyear 2013. The return on equity in the final quarter of 2014 improved to 6.5% and the return on assets improved to 0.71%.\nSUMMARY\nBerkshire favors a profile of net interest income related interest rate risk that is neutral or asset sensitive and accepts a profile of equity at risk which is modestly liability sensitive due to market factors in the ongoing low rate environment. The Bank offers back-to-back interest rate swaps to certain commercial loan customers, which allows the Bank to book a variable rate loan while providing the customer with a contract to fix its interest rate. This allows the Company to be more competitive with national financing sources without booking long-term, fixed rate assets at current low interest rates, as well as providing a source of fee income. At year-end 2015, approximately 32% of the loan portfolio was scheduled to reprice within one year, 27% was scheduled to reprice in one - five years, and 41% was scheduled to reprice over five years. The comparable percentages at the prior year-end were 37%, 24%, and 39% respectively. The duration of the portfolio lengthened modestly in 2015 as part of the Company's strategy for improving the net interest margin. The Company estimated that the fair value of net loans exceeded carrying value by approximately 1.0% at year-end 2015, compared to 1.1% at the start of the year. This decrease reflected the impact of the acquired loans recorded at fair value and higher year-end interest rates, offsetting the benefit of improved asset quality.\nMerger and restructuring expense totaling $8.5 million in 2014 included $5.4 million in merger charges related primarily to the branch acquisition, including professional fees and integration costs with related compensation. Restructuring expenses totaled $3.1 million and included charges related to the Bank's charter change in the third quarter, together with costs for financial systems and certain branch closings and property liquidations. The higher $14.8 million in costs in 2013 were due primarily to the integration of the acquired operations of Beacon Federal Bancorp and the enterprise expense restructuring project that was initiated in the third quarter of that year.\nUnder the Enhanced Prudential Standards which became effective under federal regulation at midyear in 2014, the largest banks are required to adopt a number of practices to manage and reduce liquidity risk. These standards do not apply directly to Berkshire but are affecting U.S. deposit markets. In some circumstances, these standards increase the attractiveness of retail deposits and decrease the attractiveness of large commercial deposits for the largest banks, and these changes may affect the competitive conditions that evolve based on these new standards. Including the acquired Hampden deposits, the Bank's estimate of its total deposit balances which exceed FDIC insurance limits increased to $1.34 billion, or 24% of total deposits at year-end 2015 from $1.07 billion, or 23%, at the start of the year.\nTables with the above information are presented in Item 6 of this report.\nFee income increased by $4 million, or 8%, to $57 million in 2015. Fourth quarter annualized fee income increased by $5 million, or 10%, to $57 million, including the $3 million estimated benefit from acquired operations and net of a $10 million increase in annualized tax credit investment amortization charges. Loan related income increased by $2 million to $8 million for the year. This included a $1 million increase in interest rate swap income to $4 million and a $1 million increase in gains on the sale of seasoned loans to $2 million. Mortgage banking income increased by $2 million to $4 million. Both loan related income and mortgage banking income benefited from higher volume due to low interest rates through much of 2015, as illustrated by the 40 basis point decrease in average ten year U.S. treasury rates to 2.14% in 2015 from 2.54% in the prior year. Additionally, the lower rate environment contributed to wider gain on sale spreads for both mortgage banking revenue and seasoned loan sales. Fee income variances for deposit, wealth, and insurance revenues were no greater than 2% from year to year and generally reflected lower margins on increased business volumes, including lower fee revenue penetration in acquired Hampden operations. Deposit related fee income in 2015 totaled $25 million and included $10 million in overdraft charges, $7 million in card related income, and $8 million in all other deposit related revenue. Annualized fourth quarter deposit related fees declined to 0.46% of average deposits in 2015 from 0.53% in 2014 including the impact of lower Hampden related fees. Wealth management fees in 2015 benefited from higher average securities prices which contributed to portfolio values on which these fees are based.\nThe net unrealized gain on the investment portfolio was $11 million, or 0.8% of cost at year-end. This was down from $18 million, or 1.6% of cost at the start of the year. While average long term interest rates were down in 2015, they increased near year-end following the historic increase in short term rates announced by the Federal Reserve Bank in December. This caused a reduction in unrealized bond gains as of year-end. There were no impairment losses recorded in 2015 and all securities were performing during the year and at year-end.\nTotal Net Revenue. Total net revenue was approximately $226 million in both 2014 and 2013. Annualized net revenue improved to $243 million in the final quarter of 2014, or $9.77 per share. Excluding net securities gains, this represented an increase of 17%, or $35 million, from annualized net revenue in the final quarter of 2013 and was also a 3% increase over the similar measure in 2012. The growth in 2014 included approximately $16 million in anticipated revenue benefit from the acquired New York branches as well as approximately $5 million in benefit from lower borrowing costs related to the hedge termination. Management estimated that fourth quarter revenue increased by approximately 8% from organic growth and business expansion in 2014 from 2013 including volume related increases in both net interest income and fee revenue.\nThe greatest sources of uncertainty affecting liquidity are deposit withdrawals and usage of loan commitments, which are influenced by interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Due to the unusual and prolonged low interest rate environment, there is uncertainty about the behavior of deposits if interest rates increase at some future time as is anticipated. The Company believes that its market positioning and relationship focus will generally enhance the stability of its deposits, and it also models various scenarios for the purpose of contingency liquidity planning. The Bank relies on competitive rates, customer service, and long-standing relationships with customers to manage deposit and loan liquidity. Based on its historical experience, management believes that it has adequately provided for deposit and loan liquidity needs. Both liquidity and capital resources are managed according to policies approved by the Board of Directors and executive management and the Board reviews liquidity metrics and contingency plans on a regular basis. The Bank actively manages all aspects of its balance sheet to achieve its objectives for earnings, liquidity, asset quality, interest rate risk, and capital.\nResidential real estate markets were comparatively strong in Eastern Massachusetts, where the majority of the Company's loan originators are located. Additionally, the Company added to its originations team in other regions in its footprint.\nCOMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses totaled $15.0 million in 2014, compared to $11.4 million in 2013. The provision for loan losses exceeded net loan charge-offs in both years, and resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses related to growth in the loan portfolio during the year.\nSummary: Berkshire continued to extend, deepen, and diversify its banking footprint in 2015. Total assets increased by $1.3 billion, or 20%, to $7.8 billion, including $687 million in assets resulting from the Hampden acquisition and $201 million in assets resulting from the Firestone acquisition. Excluding these acquisitions, organic asset growth totaled $442 million, or 7%, primarily due to 8% loan growth excluding acquired loans. Deposits acquired from Hampden totaled $484 million, and deposit growth from business activities totaled 10% which funded most of the remaining growth in the loan portfolio. The loan/deposit ratio increased slightly to 102% from 101% during the year. The Company's risk management maintained the momentum of favorable and improving asset quality while also producing significant recoveries of purchased impaired loans which contributed to the year's income. The acquisitions were primarily financed with stock consideration and were accretive to Berkshire's capital ratios. Internal capital generation was also sufficient to support growth from business activities, along with a dividend increase and strengthening of capital metrics. Berkshire's focus on improving profitability is targeted to further strengthen internal capital generation as a fundamental element of its capital strength. Berkshire continues to manage its interest rate sensitivity with the goal of benefiting income from expected future increases in interest rates and to limit the risk to income and equity from higher interest rates in the long term.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued a Proposed Accounting Standards Update (Subtopic 825-15), more commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, or CECL. It is proposed to move from an incurred loss model to a life-of-expected loss model. FASB has proposed to remove the probability threshold, adding forecasting, and requiring more in-depth analysis and disclosure for the credit loss estimation. It is anticipated that banks will generally carry higher loan loss allowance estimates as a result of this change and that loan loss estimates be made at acquisition date for loans acquired in business combinations. Further analysis of the impacts of this expected change will depend on final implementation rules.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, Berkshire entered into an agreement to acquire the business model of 44 Business Capital and certain other assets of Parke Bank's SBA 7(a) loan program operations. As part of the agreement, 44 Business Capital's team will join Berkshire. The agreement includes the purchase of SBA loans totaling approximately $38 million that were originated through this team. These loans share pro rata with the SBA in the collateral and creditor rights under the loan agreements.\nGENERAL\nDetermination of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities. The Company evaluates debt and equity securities within the Company's available for sale and held to maturity portfolios for other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI\"), at least quarterly. If the fair value of a debt security is below the amortized cost basis of the security, OTTI is required to be recognized if any of the following are met: (1) the Company intends to sell the security; (2) it is \"more likely than not\" that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) for debt securities, the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For all impaired debt securities that the Company intends to sell, or more likely than not will be required to sell, the full amount of the loss is recognized as OTTI through earnings. Credit-related OTTI for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings. Noncredit related OTTI for such debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. In evaluating its marketable equity securities portfolios for OTTI, the Company considers its intent and ability to hold an equity security to recovery of its cost basis in addition to various other factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer. Any OTTI on marketable equity securities is recognized immediately through earnings. Should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those expected by management, the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements.\nAcquisition related obligations are not included.\nperforming regardless of their payment status. Therefore, some overall portfolio measures of asset quality are not comparable between years or among institutions as a result of recent business combinations. A general goal is to achieve significant resolutions of impaired loans acquired in bank mergers in the first year following the acquisition date. Berkshire's asset quality has reflected its strong credit disciplines together with the generally favorable economic characteristics of its region.\nIn 2014, revenue and expense increased in the first quarter due to the addition of the acquired New York branches. First quarter non-interest income and expense were significantly affected by merger related net charges. As a result, the Company recorded a net loss in the first quarter. Total revenue increased sequentially in each of the next three quarters as business volume growth more than offset a gradual tightening in the net interest margin due to changes in purchased loan accretion and ongoing asset yield compression. The net interest margin increased to 3.23% from 3.20% in the final quarter. Excluding non-operating charges, non-interest expense was generally flat through mid-year. Adjusted expenses increased due to growth in the fourth quarter, and the Company also recorded merger charges related to the pending acquisition of Hampden Bancorp. As a result, net income decreased slightly in the final quarter after rising in the second and third quarters. Fourth quarter net income of $0.46 per share was 10% higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the ongoing benefit of positive operating leverage generated by revenue growth driven by higher volumes.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash needs at all times with available cash and from established external liquidity sources or by conversion of other assets to cash at a reasonable price and in a timely manner. Berkshire evaluates liquidity at the holding company and on a consolidated basis, which is primarily a function of the Bank's liquidity.\nLoan growth from acquisitions in 2015 included the Hampden acquisition in April and the Firestone acquisition in August. The $493 million Hampden loan portfolio consisted largely of Springfield area loans and included $130 million of residential mortgages, $281 million of commercial loans, and $82 million of consumer loans. At acquisition, the portfolio was recorded with a 1.7% discount to Hampden's net carrying value. This $8 million discount included a $12 million discount on purchased credit impaired loans, and a net $4 million premium on non-impaired loans which primarily reflected the premium value of fixed rate loans. Since 2011, Hampden's annual net loan charge-offs averaged less than 0.20% of average loans. The Firestone portfolio consisted of equipment loans to small specialized businesses in a national portfolio which have higher lending spreads that reflect the additional administration that is characteristic of this specialized business line. Berkshire views the credit history of these acquired operations as favorable. The $194 million Firestone portfolio was recorded with a 1.4% discount to net carrying value. This $3 million discount included a $4 million discount on purchased credit impaired loans, and a net $1 million premium on non-impaired loans.\nAll other non-interest income totaled $2.6 million in 2014 and $2.9 million in 2013. Results in 2014 included $3.1 million recorded for the accrual of earnings on bank owned life insurance and were net of $1.5 million in charges representing the book loss on tax shelter investments. These losses are more than offset by tax credit benefits as described in the later section on income tax expense.\nQuarterly Results. Quarterly results for 2015 and 2014 are presented in a note to the consolidated financial statements. Quarterly results were affected by the revenue downturn in 2013 and subsequent actions to improve profitability. Quarterly results have also been affected by purchased loan accretion and by merger and restructuring related net costs. The Company also evaluates adjusted earnings on a quarterly basis to supplement its understanding of operating trends. Based on these evaluations, the Company believed that its adjusted results on a per share basis improved sequentially in all quarters in 2014 and 2015 except for the fourth quarter of 2015 when adjusted results were flat. Similarly, operating profitability determined on an adjusted basis improved throughout 2014 and 2015, although not yet back to levels prevailing at the start of 2013.\nOther Assets. There were immaterial changes in total premises and the category of other assets in 2015 due to the acquisitions and growth in business activities. Total intangible assets increased by $58 million to $335 million due to the goodwill associated with the Hampden and Firestone acquisitions. Intangibles totaled 6.3% of the assets acquired with Hampden and 7.8% of the acquired Firestone assets. Bank owned life insurance and the net deferred tax asset increased primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions. Cash and short term investments increased due to business growth and to high overnight funds at year-end.\nPlease refer to the notes on Recently Adopted Accounting Principles and Future Application of Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\nFinancial results in 2015 included $2 million in pre-tax Firestone merger related charges. The merger consideration paid to shareholders was $56 million, consisting of approximately 75% stock and 25% cash and the Company issued 1.442 million shares as consideration. The Company estimates that this acquisition was accretive to adjusted earnings per share and profitability metrics, as well as to capital ratios. The Firestone merger was estimated as $0.05 dilutive to the Company's tangible book value per share. Berkshire estimated that Firestone operations contributed $0.01 to earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was the first full quarter of combined operations. No cost saves were targeted for this business combination. The Company's goal is that Firestone's operations will produce a double digit return on its equity investment and tangible book value dilution will be repaid from Firestone's operating earnings accretion in 2.5 years.\nIn addition to fee income, non-interest income includes other items, as well as securities/gains losses. Other items include the amortization of the carrying balance in tax credit investment projects, which is more than offset by benefits included in income tax expense. The Company's investment in these projects increased in 2015 due to certain redevelopment projects in its markets which include capital gains credits which are recorded at origination based on future expected capital gains income. This amortization, which is a charge against non-interest revenues, increased to $11 million in 2015 from $2 million in the prior year. These projects are discussed in the following section on income tax expense. Other items included in non-interest income in 2015 were $4 million in accrued income on bank owned life insurance policies and $1 million in distributions on investments. Securities gains/losses in both years consisted of gains on equity securities offset by bond losses. Stock gains totaled $4 million in 2015 as discussed in the earlier section on Investment Securities. In 2014, a $9 million loss was recorded on the termination of hedges as a result of the New York branch purchase; this loss was already recorded in equity and the income statement charge had no direct impact on total equity when it was recorded.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company and the Bank target to maintain sufficient capital to qualify for the Well Capitalized\u201d designation by federal regulators. Berkshire's goal is to use capital efficiently to achieve its objective to become a higher performance company with a targeted return on equity exceeding 10%. A double digit return on equity is used to benchmark all lending and investment programs, together with all acquisition analyses. The Company seeks to maintain a competitive cost of capital and capital structure. The Company generally targets to maintain a ratio of tangible equity/tangible assets in the range of 7-8%.\nPurchased loan accretion totaled $6.7 million in 2014, which was down significantly from $18.1 million in 2013 due to the seasoning of the portfolio. Purchased impaired loans totaled $14 million at year-end 2014, which was 54% of the contractual balance of $26 million of these loans. The unamortized balance of net accretable yield on impaired loans was $2.5 million at year-end 2014 compared to $2.6 million at the start of the year.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe net interest margin was generally declining through 2014 and then expanded in 2015, primarily due to the contribution of the acquired operations. The full year net interest margin increased to 3.31% in 2015 from 3.26% in 2014. The expansion mostly reflected higher yields on commercial loans (due to the acquisitions and the remix of the commercial portfolio) which was partially offset by lower yields on mortgages and consumer loans due to yield compression in the ongoing low rate environment. The improved margin also reflected a modest lengthening of asset durations and shortening of liability durations. The net interest margin was 3.35% in the final quarter of 2015. The Company's goal is to maintain the margin in its business activities but the overall margin is expected to decrease modestly as a result of the additional cost of the forward interest rate swaps that become effective in 2016 as well as less benefit from purchased loan accretion as the portfolio of purchased credit impaired loans is further reduced from ongoing collections activities. The Company's goal is to maintain volume growth and market share improvement that will produce overall growth in net interest income despite possible margin tightening from these factors. As discussed in the following section on Market Risk, the Company expects that there will be ongoing market pressures on the net interest margin if the low interest rate environment persists and if the yield curve flattens, and it is positioned with a target to benefit if interest rates increase from the historic lows seen in recent years.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income is the primary contributor to revenue. Berkshire targets growth in net interest income based on increased business volumes related to market share gains in its markets. Pricing disciplines for loans and deposits target a balance of market share and profitability objectives, while taking into account credit, liquidity, and interest rate sensitivity objectives. The Company also borrows to fund an investment portfolio to contribute to income and profitability, together with other balance sheet objectives. Acquired assets and liabilities are marked to market for carrying value and yield, and balance sheet adjustments are often made at or following the acquisition date to integrate the acquired balance sheet with the Company's balance sheet. In 2015, the most significant adjustment was the replacement of Firestone's borrowings with lower cost brokered time deposits as the primary funding source for that operation. Net interest income includes significant components related to the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and deferred items. The most significant component is purchased loan accretion related to recoveries on the resolution of acquired impaired assets, where Berkshire has regularly posted significant gains that are included in net interest income. These gains are difficult to forecast and are highly variable from quarter to quarter, and generally reflect the Company's strong asset management capabilities and continued strong demand for higher yielding assets in the ongoing low rate environment.\nIn 2015, Berkshire expanded through acquisition and business development, and made progress in rebuilding profitability compared to the prior two years. Berkshire acquired Hampden, a Springfield area community bank, in the second quarter and Firestone, a national specialty equipment finance company, in the third quarter. Business development included ongoing commercial expansion, recruitment of market managers in targeted business lines, and investment in tax advantaged development projects in the Company's footprint. The Company's income also continued to benefit from recoveries achieved on the resolution of impaired loans acquired in recent acquisitions.\nThe Hampden deposit portfolio consisted largely of Springfield area accounts and increased Berkshire's estimated market share to a top four position in that market. These acquired deposits included $97 million in demand deposits, $51 million in NOW accounts, $62 million in money market accounts, $120 million in savings balances, and $154 million in time account balances. Berkshire's deposit cost decreased from 0.44% in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 0.42% in the second quarter of 2015 and then increased to 0.48% in the fourth quarter reflecting higher costs of money market accounts related to targeted promotions.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nMassachusetts, Firestone is a longstanding profitable commercial specialty finance company providing secured installment loan equipment financing for small and medium-sized businesses. Firestone lends nationally, financing fitness equipment, carnival rides and games, amusement and video entertainment, gaming, vending, laundry, and ATM machines. This acquisition provides revenue diversification to Berkshire and increased opportunities for cross sales of existing Berkshire products and services. This business is viewed as complementary to Berkshire's existing specialized financing businesses, including asset based lending and SBA loan programs. Firestone is being operated as a subsidiary of Berkshire Bank and is maintaining its existing operations with a goal of expanding its programs based on Berkshire's increased capital and financing capabilities.\nAsset Quality. Berkshire has a Chief Risk Officer and a Risk Management and Capital Committee of the Board which keep a close focus on maintaining strong asset quality. This includes setting loan portfolio objectives, maintaining sound underwriting, close portfolio oversight, and careful management of problem assets and potential problem assets. Additionally, merger due diligence is an integral component of maintaining asset quality. Acquired loans are recorded at fair value and are deemed\nDeposits. Berkshire's deposits increased by $934 million, or 20%, to $5.6 billion in 2015. This funded most of the 22% increase in the loan portfolio. The acquired Hampden deposits contributed a 10% increase in the portfolio, brokered time deposits contributed 9%, and 3% growth was contributed by transaction account balances. Ongoing business development remains focused on relationship oriented retail and commercial offerings. The Company has actively managed its branch network in recent years. In 2015, the Company added ten branches through the Hampden acquisition and consolidated seven branches and sold its Tennessee branch (related to the 2012 Beacon Federal acquisition). The total branch count was 93 offices at the end of the year, compared to 91 at the start of the year. The Company is evaluating further opportunities for denovo locations and branch designs and technology enhancements, as well as additional sales/consolidations of existing branches. Berkshire continues to diversify its distribution network, including expanding its My Banker and private banking teams and integrating more closely with its wealth management, investment services, small business, insurance, and other business lines. Berkshire also continues to enhance its mobile and electronic delivery channels, and introduced the Apple Pay\u00ae service in 2015. The Company is initiating the rollout of real time customer feedback technology. In 2015, the Company completed its shift away from the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund ( DIF\u201d) due to the Company's growth beyond the DIF insurance limits. There were mix shifts in the deposit portfolio as management adjusted its strategies following the Hampden acquisition and targeted newer market segments and institutional balances.\nThe Bank utilizes the mortgage secondary market as a source of funds for residential mortgages which are sold into that market. This business volume expanded in 2015 as a result of higher residential mortgage demand. Secondary market counterparties include federal mortgage agencies and national financial institutions. The secondary market for jumbo mortgages has been limited in recent years and these mortgages have become more prevalent in the Bank's originations mix. The majority of these loan originations were retained on the Bank's books in 2015. Over the last two years, the Bank has also increased its wholesale purchases and sales of loans including residential mortgages, consumer loans, and commercial loans and loan participations. Commercial loan growth has also included purchases of participations in syndicated loan transactions. These participations are variable rate and the Company views these assets as more liquid and saleable through secondary market channels.\nStockholders' Equity. Berkshire pursues a balance of capital to maintain financial soundness while using common equity efficiently with the goal to produce a strong return on equity and a strong return on tangible equity to support opportunities for franchise growth. Long run growth in dividends and in both book value and tangible book value per share are also viewed as elements for shareholder value creation. A sound capital structure reduces risk and enhances shareholder return and access to\nThe Company realized $4 million in securities gains and $2 million in losses in 2015. The gains were primarily on bank equity securities, including a $2 million gain on the investment in Hampden stock as well as gains on stocks of other banks due to mergers announced by those institutions during the year. The bond losses related primarily to the reduction in non-investment grade bonds in the final quarter due to deteriorating market conditions. In addition to net securities gains, the Company also had a $1 million benefit to non-interest income from special non-dividend distributions received from certain stocks and mutual funds. As a result of its charter change in 2014, the Bank is no longer permitted to invest in new equity securities, but the holding company is permitted to make equity investments subject to certain regulatory restrictions.\nIn addition to fee revenues, non-interest income included an $8.8 million loss recorded on the termination of hedges in 2014 and net securities gains totaling $4.8 million in 2013. The securities gains in 2013 were primarily related to the sale of bank equity securities to realize strong market appreciation on these securities. The hedge termination loss in 2014 was a result of the branch acquisition and is further described in the notes to the financial statements. This loss was the recognition of a fair value loss already recorded in equity and therefore had no direct impact on shareholders' equity when it was recorded.\nThe Company improved its efficiency including the benefit of achieving the targeted 35% cost saves associated with the Hampden acquisition and lowering the funding costs of the Firestone portfolio. Berkshire improved its brand messaging with new brand signage in all locations and targeted promotions with prominent spokespersons. Community support initiatives were expanded, and mobile banking solutions were enhanced including the addition of Apple Pay\u00ae functionality. The Company promoted and reorganized executive management to strengthen leadership across its footprint and business lines.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion. The accounting and reporting policies followed by the Company conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While the Company bases estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe Risk Management and Capital Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight of Berkshire's capital management and plans. The Company is deepening its capital analytics and stress testing capabilities as it grows toward the $10 billion federal regulatory threshold under the Dodd-Frank legislation. While the Company recognizes the potential increased compliance costs and restrictions as growth nears or exceeds that threshold, the Company believes that other size advantages can offset those impacts over time in many markets including its own.\nMortgage banking income decreased by 51% to $2.6 million in 2014 from $5.2 million in the prior year. Berkshire's mortgage banking revenue is recorded on interest rate lock commitments related to loans originated for sale. The volume of these commitments was $304 million in 2014. The Company recorded 2.12% in gross revenue on these commitments and 0.84% net of direct costs of origination in 2014. Wealth management revenue increased by 10% in 2014 to $9.5 million from $8.7 million, including the benefit of higher market prices for assets under management. Total wealth assets under management increased to $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion in 2014.\nThe Company considers the allowance for loan losses appropriate to cover probable losses which can be reasonably estimated and which are inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Under accounting standards for business combinations, acquired loans are recorded at fair value with no loan loss allowance on the date of acquisition. The fair value of acquired loans includes the impact of estimated loan losses for the life of the portfolio, including factors which are not probable or inherent as of the acquisition date, and including subjective assessments of risk. A loan loss allowance is recorded by the Company for the emergence of new probable and estimable losses relating to acquired loans which were not impaired as of the acquisition date. Because of the accounting for acquired loans, some measures of the loan loss allowance are not comparable to periods prior to the acquisition date or to other financial institutions. Loans acquired in business combinations totaled $1.16 billion, or 20% of total loans at year-end 2015, compared to $762 million, or 16% of total loans at year-end 2014.\nThe efficiency ratio improved to 61.3% from 63.2% as the Company pursues its goal to reduce this ratio below 60%. The efficiency ratio improved to 60.6% in the final quarter of the year including Hampden cost saves. The fourth quarter ratio of adjusted non-interest expense to average assets decreased to 2.43% in 2015 from 2.49% in 2014.\nIn 2015, quarterly revenue and expense reflected the Hampden acquisition on April 17 and the Firestone acquisition on August 7. Results also reflected the increased benefit of tax credit related investments beginning in the first quarter. By the fourth quarter, all acquired operations were fully integrated and the Company estimated that it completed the planned Hampden cost saves during the quarter. As a result, fourth quarter operations were generally reflective of the Company's current run rate including the acquired operations. In the preceding discussion of 2015 results, references have been made to fourth quarter adjusted results to demonstrate the full benefit of the year's actions.\nExpense growth in 2015 was mostly in the primary operating expense components of compensation, occupancy, and technology due to the acquisitions and growth in business activities. Full time equivalent staff totaled 1,221 at year-end 2015, a 12% increase from 1,091 a year earlier, including staff related to acquired operations.\nThe Company makes further measurements of fair value of certain assets and liabilities, as described in the related note in the financial statements. The most significant measurements of recurring fair values of financial instruments primarily relate to securities available for sale and derivative instruments. These measurements were included in the previous discussion of changes in financial condition, and were generally based on Level 2 market based inputs. Non-recurring fair value measurements primarily relate to impaired loans, capitalized mortgage servicing rights, and other real estate owned. When measurement is required, these measures are generally based on Level 3 inputs.\nThe year-end 2015 contractual obligations were as follows:\nThis discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report.\nTotal Net Revenue. Berkshire evaluates its top line with the measure of net revenue, which is the sum of net interest income and non-interest income. The Company also evaluates adjusted net revenue in evaluating its operations and the revenue component of its strategies for generating positive operating leverage. Berkshire also measures adjusted revenue per share in evaluating its growth strategies.\nAVERAGE BALANCES, INTEREST, AVERAGE YIELDS/COST AND RATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS\nShareholders' equity increased by $178 million, or 25%, to $887 million in 2015, including $157 million issued for the acquisitions and $27 million in retained earnings. Total shares outstanding increased by 5.791 million, or 23%, to 30.974 million. Book value per share increased by 2% to $28.64 from $28.17. Both acquisitions were modestly dilutive to tangible book value per share as discussed in a later section, but retained earnings were sufficient to boost tangible book value per share by 4% to $17.84 from $17.19. The acquisitions were accretive to the Company's capital ratios, and there was an increase in the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets to 7.4% from 7.0%. Tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by investors and it excludes goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company was within the range of 7 - 8% that it generally targets for this measure and also considers its return on tangible equity as a source of capital strength for improving its condition and supporting its growth. The ratio of equity to assets also increased to 11.3% from 10.9% and the Company's risk based capital ratio improved to 11.9% from 11.4%. The Company's goal is to remain eligible for the regulatory designation of Well Capitalized for the Company and the Bank.\nItem 7 - 7A - Table 1 - Contractual Obligations\nDeposit related fees increased by $6 million, or 34%, to $25 million in 2014, including an estimated $4 million related to the New York branch acquisition. These branches acquired from a national bank had a higher rate of fee income generation compared to the Company's existing deposits. Accordingly, the annualized ratio of deposit fee income to average deposits increased to 0.54% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 0.48% in the same quarter of the prior year. Deposit fees in 2014 included $10 million in overdraft income, $8 million in card fee income, and $7 million in service charge income.\nNet Interest Income. Gross interest income increased by $3 million, or 2%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The average balance of earning assets increased by 18%, which was mostly offset by a decrease in the net interest margin to 3.26% in 2014 from 3.63% in 2013. Total loan interest income decreased by $12 million, or 6%, but this was more than offset by a $15 million, or 85%, increase in securities and other interest income as acquired New York deposits were initially used to fund growth in the securities portfolio. The decrease in loan interest income was due to lower average yields. While average loan balances increased by 11%, the average loan yield decreased to 3.98% in 2014 from 4.69% in 2013. By the fourth quarter, yield\nIncome Taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities. The realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable ordinary income, taxable capital gain income, and the existence of prior years' taxable income, to which \"carry back\" refund claims could be made. A valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that management estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. In determining the valuation allowance, the Company uses historical and forecasted future operating results, including a review of the eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. In particular, income tax benefits and deferred tax assets generated from tax-advantaged commercial development projects are based on management's assessment and interpretation of applicable tax law as it currently stands. These underlying assumptions can change from period to period. For example, tax law changes or variances in projected taxable ordinary income or taxable capital gain income could result in a change in the deferred tax asset or the valuation allowance. Should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those considered by management, the actual realization of the net deferred tax asset could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. If the Company is not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset in excess of the valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made.\nNon-Interest Income. Fee income increased by $3 million, or 6%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Fourth quarter fee income increased by $2 million, or 17%, from year to year. This included an estimated $1 million related to the branch purchase and $1 million related to all other factors. All major categories of fee income were up year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to Berkshire's growth. For the full year, most categories were up except for mortgage banking fee income and other loan related fee income. Due to a spike in interest rates, mortgage banking revenues declined sharply around midyear 2013 from elevated levels that have not recurred and are not expected to recur.\nInterest rates remained low throughout much of the year, and credit conditions in the region continued to be comparatively strong. As a result, industry margins remained under pressure due to ongoing yield compression and competitive conditions. Through its acquisitions and balance sheet strategies, Berkshire increased its net interest margin while also maintaining strong asset performance metrics and maintaining positive asset sensitivity. Growth in the U.S. economy contributed to economic improvement throughout most of the Company's markets, with conditions particularly strong in the Boston and Albany markets.\ncompression had decreased and based on ongoing volume growth, fourth quarter loan interest income increased by 5% over the same period in 2013.\nThe Bank has acquired banks and fee based businesses in recent years. Berkshire's goal is that its stock is the primary capital resource for merger consideration. The Hampden acquisition was 100% for stock and Firestone was 75%. The pending 44 Business Capital acquisition has a small stock component. Through active investor relations, the Company's goal is to maintain a solid profile with the investment community for the purposes of supporting outstanding capital and raising other capital as opportunities arise. The Company has an ongoing universal shelf registration with the SEC to facilitate capital issuances. The Company issued common and preferred stock in the past, as well as senior and subordinated debt.\nExpense growth was mostly in the primary operating expense components of compensation, occupancy, and technology. In total, these costs increased by $17 million, or 16 %, in 2014. Excluding the costs related to the acquired branches, these costs were up an estimated 3% for the year. All other operating costs were down $1.3 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a $2.4 million decrease in professional services from elevated levels in 2013.\nFinancial instruments comprise the majority of the Company assets and liabilities. The net combined fair value of those instruments contributes to the economic value of the Company's equity. This net premium value of financial instruments increased by $108 million to $506 million in 2015, reflecting the benefit of the tangible equity contributed by the acquisitions plus the increase in retained earnings, and less the impact of the lower premium related to loans. Instruments acquired in business combinations were recorded at fair value at acquisition date. These measures do not take into account the non-interest income generated by these customer relationships or the long term intangible value of the Company's franchise in its markets.\nFurther information about borrowings and lease obligations is in the notes on borrowings and commitments to the financial statements.\ncapital markets to support the Company's banking activities and the markets that it serves. In its payment of dividends, management of treasury shares, issuance of equity compensation, and balancing of capital sources, the Company strives to achieve a capital structure that is attractive to the investment community and which satisfies the policy and supervision purposes of the Company's regulators. When Berkshire negotiates business combinations, it generally targets to use its common shares as a significant component of merger consideration and to balance the mix of cash and stock to arrive at targeted capital metrics based on the characteristics of the combined banks. All of the Company's outstanding equity is owned by common stockholders and its stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition to shares held in Treasury, a Bank subsidiary also owns 169 thousand Berkshire shares as a result of the conversion of Hampden shares, and these shares are also excluded from shares outstanding.\nAs a result of the Company's strategies, the fourth quarter yield on the investment portfolio decreased only slightly to 2.96% in 2015 compared to 3.00% in 2014, despite the decrease in rates between those periods. The average life of the bond portfolio was 4.9 years at year-end, compared to 4.5 years at the start of the year.\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nHampden Bancorp Acquisition. The Hampden acquisition was completed on April 17, 2015. Hampden was a community bank headquartered in Springfield, Massachusetts and serving the Springfield area. This in-market merger was targeted to benefit all constituencies, bringing additional products and services to the Hampden customers, providing revenue synergies and cost efficiencies to the combined operations, and boosting Berkshire's Springfield deposit share in the Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area to the top 4 position based on most recent data. Berkshire is the largest Massachusetts based bank now serving the Springfield market. Berkshire consolidated 3 of the Hampden branches in the second quarter and now operates a total of 17 branches in that market, including 7 former Hampden offices.\nBerkshire financed the two acquisitions primarily through the issuance of common stock, which was accretive to most of the Company's capital metrics. The Company completed its transition from the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund ( DIF\u201d), which was initiated in 2014. Demand deposit increases drove organic deposit growth throughout this transition, even while seven branches were being consolidated and one branch was being sold as part of Berkshire's ongoing management of its sales and service channels across its regions. Including the loans acquired with Firestone, the Company increased its utilization of wholesale funding, including expanded use of brokered deposits. Berkshire increased its shareholder dividend and also grew its tangible book value per share as a result of the double digit return on tangible equity.\nThe SEC defines critical accounting policies\u201d as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods. Please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion. Management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the SEC's definition:\nelements of the Company's strategies related to efficiency and return on equity. Based on their final reported results, annualized operating expenses totaled $17 million for Hampden and $10 million for Firestone. The Company believes that it achieved its goal of 35% cost saves for Hampden by the end of 2015. The Company did not target any cost saves for Firestone except for reducing borrowing costs, which are an element of net interest income and were achieved.\nThe notional value of derivatives increased by $332 million, or 32%, to $1.37 billion in 2015. This included $320 million due to growth in commercial loan interest rate swaps, reflecting the improved market demand and the Company's focus on serving this niche, which often involves larger, stronger commercial accounts with other relationship potential. Each such swap involves a derivative sold to the customer and a generally matching derivative purchased from a national counterparty. Accordingly, this net growth reflects about $160 million in underlying loans to provide commercial customers with a contracted fixed rate while allowing the Bank to record a variable rate loan. This net growth from $90 million in the prior year contributed to the increase in loan related fee income previously discussed.\nCOMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nNon-Interest Expense. Total non-interest expense increased by $9 million, or 5%, in 2014. The Company estimated that it added approximately $13 million in annual expense related to the New York branch purchase. Total merger, restructuring, and conversion expense decreased by $6 million to $8 million in 2014. The Company estimated that total non-interest expense increased approximately 2% before the impacts of the branch purchase and the changes in merger, restructuring, and conversion expense. Total non-interest expense decreased to 2.69% of average assets in 2014 from 2.97% in 2013. The Company's non-GAAP measure of adjusted non-interest expense decreased to 2.55% of assets from 2.68 for these respective periods, and decreased further to 2.49 in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOther liabilities increased by $6 million to $91 million in 2015. The balance at year-end 2014 included a $22 million amount payable for commercial loan participation interests purchased at year-end; there was no similar balance due at year-end 2015. This decrease was partially offset by a $10 million increase in the fair value liability of derivative securities which is discussed in a later section, along with growth in operating accruals.\nAcquired Loans. Loans that the Company acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses. Determining the fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. Going forward, the Company continues to evaluate reasonableness of expectations for the timing and the amount of cash to be collected. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows may result in changes in the amortization or accretion of fair market value adjustments, and in some cases may result in the loan being considered impaired. For collateral dependent loans with deteriorated credit quality, the Company estimates the fair value of the underlying collateral of the loans. These values are discounted using market derived rates of return, with consideration given to the period of time and costs associated with the foreclosure and disposition of the collateral.\nsecurities to collateralize certain municipal deposit account balances. Securities pledged to these accounts increased to $136 million from $42 million during the year.\nIn 2015, the Bank's primary uses of funds were loan growth and the replacement of Firestone's borrowings and the primary source of funds were brokered deposits. During the year, the Bank shifted more of its assets into the FHLBB collateral pool, including acquired Hampden assets which Hampden had used for similar purposes. Total FHLBB unused borrowing availability was $576 million at year-end, compared to $246 million at the start of the year.\nBerkshire increased its ownership in investment tax credit entities as an aspect of its overall operating and financial strategy for building customer relationships, supporting its communities, and contributing to profitability. In 2015, the company recorded a $16 million reduction in the income tax provision related to tax credits and deductions generated primarily from investment in historic rehabilitation and low income housing projects. The company recorded an $11 million reduction in the carrying balance as a corresponding charge against non-interest income, with a $5 million resulting net contribution to net income. In 2014, there was a $2.3 million reduction in the tax provision and a $1.5 million charge against non-interest income, resulting in a $0.8 million net contribution to net income. As a result of the tax credit program, the Company's effective income tax rate decreased to 9% in 2015 from 26% in 2014. Measured before the tax credit benefit, the effective income tax rate was 32% in 2015, compared to 30% in 2014. In addition to the tax credit benefit, the Company's effective tax rate also benefits from its investments in municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance.\nRecent results stem from Berkshire's strategy to build profitability and shareholder value through disciplined growth based around the power of its investment in a well-positioned regional franchise and a competitive market position supported by its unique brand and culture. This strategy includes taking advantage of opportunities offered by banks, companies, and teams that are looking for a regional partner to provide the resources necessary to meet market demand economically in light of the regulatory and margin pressures on revenues and earnings. The Company's long term profitability goals include a return on assets exceeding 1% and a double digit return on equity.\nAt year-end 2015, the remaining carrying balance of purchased credit impaired loans was $21 million and the contractual amount owed on these loans was $40 million. The comparable measures at year-end 2014 were $14 million and $26 million, respectively. In 2015, purchased credit impaired loans acquired from Hampden were recorded with a fair value of $17 million compared to a $29 million contractual balance. The balances acquired from Firestone were recorded with a value of $2 million compared to a $5 million contractual balance.\nThe most significant fair value measurements recorded by the Company are those related to assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. These measurements are discussed further in the mergers and acquisitions note to the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded as a result of business acquisitions and combinations. These assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When these assets are evaluated for impairment, if the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to income. The fair value is based on observable market prices, when practicable. Other valuation techniques may be used when market prices are unavailable, including estimated discounted cash flows and analysis of market pricing multiples. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. In the event of future changes in fair value, the Company may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.\nBerkshire's Home Lending operation originated approximately $791 million in residential mortgages in 2015, compared to approximately $546 million in the prior year. A decrease in long term interest rates in the first quarter of 2015 spurred higher refinancing volume in the first half of the year, and originations slowed in the second half of the year.\nBerkshire provides a summary of estimated fair values of financial instruments at each quarter-end. The premium or discount value of loans has historically been the most significant element of this presentation. This discount is a Level 3 estimate and reflects management's subjective judgments. At year-end 2015, the premium value of the loan portfolio was $42 million, or 0.7% of carrying value. The premium value is down from $50 million, or 1.1% of carrying value at year-end 2014. This decrease reflected the impact of the acquired loans recorded at fair value and higher year-end interest rates and spreads, offsetting the benefit of improved asset quality.\n(1) Consists of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The maturities extend through 2027 and the rates vary by borrowing.\nTotal Comprehensive Income. Berkshire's total comprehensive income in 2015 was $40 million, compared to $49 million in the prior year. The $16 million increase in net income was offset by a $25 million decrease in other comprehensive income due primarily to a net $22 million after-tax change in available for sale securities from an unrealized gain in 2014 to an unrealized loss in 2015. The change in securities fair value was discussed in an earlier section of this report. The increase in the unrealized loss on the Company's forward starting interest rate swaps on borrowings also contributed to the decrease in other comprehensive income in 2015.\n_______________________________\nregulatory categories, the commercial real estate portfolio measured 232% of the Bank's risk based capital at year-end 2015 and commercial construction loans measured 40% of risk based capital. The growth of commercial and industrial loans in 2015 was primarily due to the Firestone acquisition, and including the impact of this change, the Company reduced certain other C&I exposures to support its objectives for improving the net interest margin and overall return on equity. The Company has no significant direct exposure to the oil and gas industries. During the year, certain relationships were outplaced or released to competition based on the Company's pricing and credit disciplines. Improvements in the loan yield and in asset quality included the benefit of these activities. In the final quarter of the year, the yield on commercial loans before purchased loan accretion was 4.27% which was increased significantly from 3.90% in the final quarter of 2014 due to the acquisition, growth, and mix strategies.\nLIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS\nBerkshire continues to focus on strategic commercial loan growth to increase earnings, market share, and business relationships, while taking advantage of its size and geographic positioning to gain market share from national banks. The Bank's commercial banking teams operate out of its seven commercial regional offices to provide commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans together with commercial depository and banking services, as well as insurance and wealth management services. The Bank also has an asset based lending group based in its Burlington, MA office which services the entire footprint. The addition of Firestone represents an expansion of Berkshire's commercial specialty lending operations and is the first line of business with a national footprint. The Company's growing small business banking team is part of the Bank's retail organization and small business loans are included in commercial loan totals. This team improved its competitive position and was a leader in SBA lending in several of Berkshire's regions in 2015. The planned acquisition of 44 Business Capital will broaden and strengthen Berkshire's SBA lending capabilities and add the Mid-Atlantic and other geographies to its lending operations. These expanded SBA operations will also add a secondary marketing and loan servicing capacity which is expected to diversify revenues, expand product competitiveness, and lead to further business volume growth. This complements the expanded wholesale component of the Company's lending operations which include regional and national loan participations as well as loan purchases and potential sales of targeted commercial loan products.\nIncome Tax Expense. Berkshire utilizes several tax strategies which allow the Company to operate in a tax effective manner and deliver tax savings. As a result, the Company's effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate based on the federal and state income taxes in its market area. The Company participates in federal and state tax credit programs and other tax advantaged investment opportunities which are encouraged under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has also established security corporation subsidiaries and, through its subsidiaries, purchases tax exempt bonds. In 2014, the Company increased its resources in its tax management function and is pursuing additional opportunities to develop tax effective strategies which will deliver additional tax benefits and tax savings based on its expanded footprint and operating activities.\nBerkshire has also emphasized the development of its SBA loan program and has achieved a leading position as an originator of SBA guaranteed loans in several of its regional markets. Commercial loans secured with government guarantees increased to $39 million from $16 million in 2015. Near the end of 2015, Berkshire announced an agreement to acquire the lending team of 44 Business Capital, a nationally ranked SBA originator that will further contribute to the growth and diversification of Berkshire's SBA lending business.\nThe underwriting parameters for the lending operations of Firestone and 44 Business Capital reflect the specialized nature of these operations and are in some respects outside of Berkshire's traditional underwriting guidelines. Berkshire views the credit histories of these operations as favorable and has established controls to integrate these operations into its credit administration processes. They are expected to enhance the Company's product capabilities and diversify its relationship base and related revenues and credit risk characteristics.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAt year-end 2015, the company's other assets included a $3 million unamortized balance of the company's equity ownership interest in these entities. A deferred tax asset related to these programs includes a $3 million federal tax credit carryforward from past investment in new markets and renewable energy projects. The tax credit carryforward is expected to be realized in the future based on the company's ability to generate sufficient future ordinary operating income. The company recorded an additional $3 million deferred tax asset with respect to future expected capital losses from investment in historic rehabilitation and low income housing projects. This is the Company's first significant utilization of capital gain related tax benefits and realization of those benefits depends on realization of projected future capital gains. The company expects to realize the tax benefit from these capital losses in the future based on the company's ability to generate future capital gain income from a variety of sources. Investment tax credit programs depend on federal tax policy and administrative rulings and the future availability of such programs depends on future policy and administrative processes.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities. Berkshire utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk of its borrowings, to offer these instruments to commercial loan customers for similar purposes, and as part of its residential mortgage banking activities. The instruments sold to commercial and residential mortgage customers are an important source of fee income. Demand for these products tends to vary inversely with the direction of interest rates, and they are more popular when interest rates are decreasing and customers wish to lock in long term fixed interest rates that the Company cannot offer directly based on its own funding sources.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nMerger and restructuring expense totaled $18 million in 2015, compared to $8 million in the prior year. These expenses in 2015 included $11 million related to Hampden, $2 million related to Firestone, and $5 million related to restructuring including the 8 branches that were consolidated or sold. Berkshire has consistently focused on managing its branch network in recent years through a combination of consolidations, closings, sales and relocations, as well as purchasing branches and open de novo offices. In 2014, merger costs included $4 million for the New York branch acquisition and $2 million for Hampden, and restructuring costs totaled $2 million. Merger related costs primarily consist of severance costs, contract termination charges, professional fees, and variable compensation costs.\nAt year-end 2015, the holding company had $36 million in cash and equivalents, compared to $31 million at the start of the year. The Parent's cash is held on deposit in the Bank. The Bank paid $28 million in dividends to the holding company in 2015, which was an increase from $12 million in 2014, when the Bank retained more earnings to support the New York branch purchase. Dividends to the holding company from the insurance subsidiary totaled $6 million in 2015, and no such dividends were paid in 2014. The holding company has a $10 million unsecured line of credit, which was fully utilized at the start of 2015 and which was unused at year-end 2015.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by the Company. The level of the allowance is a critical accounting estimate, which is subject to uncertainty. The level of the allowance was included in the discussion of financial condition. The provision for loan losses totaled $17 million in 2015, compared to $15 million in 2014. The provision for loan losses exceeded net loan charge-offs in both years, and resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses related primarily to growth in the loan portfolio during the year.\nFirestone Financial Acquisition. The Firestone acquisition was completed on August 7, 2015. Based in Needham,\nTotal annual net revenue increased by $42 million, or 18%, to $268 million in 2015. Annualized net revenue totaled $284 million in the final quarter of the year, when both acquisitions were fully integrated. Annual results included a 20% increase in\nThe financial statements and related financial data presented in this Form 10-K have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Bank are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Bank's performance than the general level of inflation. Interest rates may be affected by inflation, but the direction and magnitude of the impact may vary. A sudden change in inflation (or expectations about inflation), with a related change in interest rates, would have a significant impact on our operations.\nnet interest income and a 14% increase in non-interest income. Fee income decreased to 21% of net interest and fee income in 2015 from 23% in 2014. Berkshire's long term goal is to increase fee income to 30% of total revenue by increasing wallet share through cross sales, product expansion, and balance sheet management. The decrease in the fee income contribution in 2015 was due to the lower fee product penetration of the acquired businesses. Berkshire believes that these acquired operations present fee revenue synergy opportunities that may be developed in the future. Both acquisitions were funded significantly with stock consideration, and fourth quarter annualized revenue per share decreased to $9.25 in 2015 from $9.77 in 2014. The acquired businesses reported $39 million in annualized net revenue in the first quarter of 2015, the final reported quarter prior to acquisition. These acquired revenues contributed most of the Company's revenue growth during the year, and totaled $6.93 per share based on the 5.6 million shares issued as merger consideration. Due to their higher profitability after cost saves at Hampden and improved funding costs at Firestone, both of these businesses were expected to contribute a double digit return on equity to future results.\nThe contribution of purchased loan accretion to net interest income was $7.6 million in 2015, including $2.4 million in the final quarter of the year. This accretion was $6.7 million in 2014. For the above respective periods, the net interest margin measured before purchased loan accretion was 3.19%, 3.22%, and 3.16% respectively. Most purchased loan accretion results from recoveries on the resolution of purchased credit impaired loans resulting from bank mergers. The fair market value of these loans is normally significantly discounted from the contractual and carrying value at the time of the merger and Berkshire's team has produced significant recoveries of value as a result of its asset management disciplines and improving market conditions for impaired assets as a result of the economic recovery and ongoing low interest rates. At year-end 2015, Berkshire's remaining carrying amount for these loans was $21 million, which was a 47% discount from the contractual balance of $40 million. This discount included a balance of $7 million in accretable discount which was expected to be recorded as interest income through the ongoing performance of these loans. The new impaired loans acquired as a result of the Hampden and Firestone transactions had a total carrying balance of $34 million which had a market discount of 46%, resulting in an $18 million carrying balance for Berkshire.\n(3) Consists of obligations with multiple vendors to purchase a broad range of services.\nInvestment Securities. Berkshire's goal is to maintain a high quality portfolio consisting primarily of liquid investment securities with managed durations to limit the potential for market value declines in rising rate markets. Berkshire focuses on loan growth as the primary use of funds and the primary source of interest income. The investment portfolio is an additional source of interest income and also provides additional liquidity and interest rate risk management flexibility. The Company evaluates the portfolio within its overall objectives of producing growth in earnings per share and contributing to return on equity. The Company continuously evaluates options for managing the portfolio's size, yield, diversification, risk, and duration.\nThe Company reports adjusted earnings per share excluding specified items. The effective tax rate on these adjusted earnings per share was estimated to be 15% in 2015. This rate was higher than the 9% GAAP tax rate in 2015 due to the lower proportionate benefit of tax advantaged items compared to the estimated adjusted pretax income. The 15% rate was lower than the 30% equivalent rate in 2014 due to the increased tax credit benefits recorded in 2015. The Company expects that the tax rate on adjusted earnings per share will revert back to the 2014 levels at the beginning of 2016. The Company expects to record additional tax credit benefits in the second half of 2016 as a result of additional investments in related projects, with the result that the full year rate on adjusted earnings is expected to be below 30%. The anticipated merger expenses for 44 Business\nThe consumer loan portfolio increased by $34 million, or 4%, to $802 million in 2015 due to $82 million in acquired Hampden balances. Excluding the acquired balances, the portfolio decreased by $48 million, or 6% due to planned runoff of indirect auto loans. In the latter part of 2014, the Company changed its strategy to de-emphasize lower rate super prime indirect auto loans as part of its net interest margin strategy, and the indirect auto portfolio has declined steadily since that time. In the third quarter of 2015, Berkshire announced the recruitment of a new team leader to expand the Company's network for prime indirect auto paper and the Company expects that consumer loan outstandings will increase in 2016 as this team builds new business volume, and the Company contemplates potential secondary market sales of indirect auto loans in future years based on its fee income and balance sheet strategies. The consumer loan portfolio yield decreased to 3.30% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 3.35% in the final quarter of 2014 due to ongoing yield compression and the Company's origination strategies. The portfolio yield was increasing in the second half of 2015, including the benefit of the acquired Hampden loans and the aging and runoff of the older super prime loans. The Company's goal is to maintain the yield of this portfolio and to gradually increase it if interest rates remain steady or increase.\nIn 2015, the portfolio was generally managed to maintain yield in the ongoing environment of low interest rates and yield compression. The most significant activity related to the integration of the acquired Hampden securities portfolio. Total securities increased by $165 million, or 14%, to $1.371 billion in 2015. This included $72 million of investment securities and $83 million in cash and short term investments acquired with Hampden Bank. Hampden had liquidated a portion of its $145 million year-end 2014 investment portfolio prior to the merger and some of these amounts were reinvested by Berkshire. The overall duration of these investments was lengthened to support a higher earnings contribution from the acquired Hampden operations, and the resulting growth in Berkshire's portfolio was concentrated in medium term agency collateralized mortgage obligations and long term municipal bonds. Most acquired municipal bonds were designated as held to maturity as part of the Company's balance sheet strategies to manage the market price risk reflected in its equity capital. In addition to its activities with investment grade securities, the Bank reduced its investment in non-investment grade securities in 2015. Investments in bank capital instruments were reduced as a result of new regulatory requirements that increased the required capital support for these investments. The Bank reduced its investment in equity securities and trust preferred securities by $23 million in 2015.\nDue to the stock issued as merger consideration, the Company estimates that the Hampden acquisition improved the ratio of tangible equity/tangible assets and also contributed positively to regulatory capital ratios. The merger was estimated as $0.33 dilutive to Berkshire's tangible book value per share. The Company estimated that the acquired operations contributed $0.02 to earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2015, including estimated 35% cost saves which were completed in the fourth quarter. The Company continues to target tangible book value dilution payback within approximately 3 years from the merger date based on merger related adjusted EPS accretion. The Company also continues to target double digit long run return on the equity invested in this acquisition.\nNon-Interest Expense. Berkshire's goal is to generate positive operating leverage, growing revenues through market share expansion and maintaining expense management disciplines. Non-interest expense increases have generally been related to the Company's growth, including the impact of acquisitions. The Company also invests in building its infrastructure and adding to its market teams, with a focus on fee generating business lines, as part of its long term strategy to occupy a leading position as a regional provider in its footprint. Expense results also include merger and restructuring costs which the Company excludes from its measure of adjusted earnings. The Company views merger related costs as part of the economic investment in acquired businesses. Restructuring costs have included the write-off of uneconomic contracted costs including contracts of acquired operations, as well as ongoing costs to optimize the branch network in light of market changes for branch services based on the emergence of mobile banking as well as changes in customer access patterns.\nLoans classified as accruing troubled debt restructurings decreased to $12 million from $13 million during the year. Foreclosed real estate was unchanged at $2 million. Accruing loans over 90 days past due improved to 0.06% from 0.8% of total loans, and loans delinquent 30-89 days improved to 0.32% from 0.42% of total loans.\nThe Company viewed its asset quality as comparatively good and improving in 2015 based on both its loans from business activities as well as acquired loans. The Company viewed the overall environmental factors as supportive of this assessment, including economic conditions and real estate market conditions and values.\nCOMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nNet loan charge-offs were 0.25% of average loans in 2015, compared to 0.29% in the prior year. Year-end 2015 non-performing assets decreased to $23 million, or 0.29% of total assets, from $24 million, or 0.37% of total assets, at the start of the year. For loans from business activities, net loan charge-offs measured 0.26% of average loans in 2015, while this measure was 0.23% for average loans acquired in business combinations.\nThe Company originates a significant portion of its mortgages for sale to manage interest rate risk associated with fixed rate mortgages. Revenue is recorded at the time that the application is rate-locked. The Company originated $438 million in rate-locks of held for sale mortgages in 2015, compared to $304 million in the prior year. Most jumbo mortgages are retained due to the lack of secondary market demand, and much of the Eastern Massachusetts production consists of jumbo mortgages due to elevated home prices in that region. Rate lock income on mortgages originated for sale is the primary component of Berkshire's mortgage banking fee income. Net of acquired Hampden loans and net of secondary market sales and other wholesale purchases and sales of residential mortgages, the mortgage portfolio increased by $189 million, or 13% in 2015. Wholesale purchases of mortgages in and around Berkshire's markets totaled $124 million and wholesale sales of seasoned mortgages totaled $121 million. Gains on seasoned loan sales are a component of other loan related non-interest income. Due to ongoing interest rate compression, the yield on the portfolio decreased to 3.72% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 3.88% in the same quarter of 2014.\nThe overall yield on earning assets decreased to 3.73% in the fourth quarter of 2014 from 3.97% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding purchased loan accretion, the yield decreased to 3.62% from 3.73%. The cost of funds decreased to 0.52% from 0.73% including the benefit of the hedge terminations in the first quarter. Through its balance sheet management, Berkshire was able to offset the earning asset yield compression so that the fourth quarter 2014 net interest margin of 3.23% was only down by 0.03% compared to 3.26% in 2013. Excluding purchased loan accretion, the fourth quarter margin improved to 3.12% from 3.07% in those same periods.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses represents probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio at the financial statement date and which may be estimated. Management uses historical information, as well as current economic data, to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors, which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen. Although management believes that it uses appropriate available information to establish the allowance for loan losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. Conditions in the local economy and real estate values could require the Company to increase provisions for loan losses, which would negatively impact earnings.\nCapital are not significant and therefore the expected GAAP effective tax rate in 2016 is not expected to be significantly different from the rate on adjusted earnings, based on conditions known at the start of the year.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Trading assets, securities available for sale, and derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, or to establish a loss allowance or write-down based on the fair value of impaired assets. Further, the notes to financial statements include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the valuation methodologies used and its impact to earnings. For financial instruments not recorded at fair value, the notes to financial statements disclose the estimate of their fair value. Due to the judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimation process, the estimates could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.\nThe total amount of the allowance increased in 2015, while the ratio of the allowance to total loans decreased to 0.69% from 0.76%. For loans from business activities, this ratio decreased to 0.76% of total loans from 0.84%. For loans acquired in business combinations, the ratio increased slightly to 0.41% from 0.38%. The year-end allowance provided 3.0X coverage of total net charge-offs in 2015, compared to 2.8X in 2014. The allowance provided 1.9X coverage of year-end non-accrual loans in 2015 compared to 1.6X in 2014.\n2015 results demonstrated a rebound from lower profitability in 2014. The adjusted return on assets increased to 0.85% in the fourth quarter of 2015 from a low of 0.71% in the second quarter of 2014. This included the benefit of an increase in the net interest margin to 3.35% from 3.26% for these dates, and an improvement in the efficiency ratio to 60.6% from 63.0%. The GAAP return on assets in these periods was 0.82% and 0.75% respectively, and included net merger and restructuring charges The increase in profitability included the benefit of positive operating leverage produced by growth from acquisitions and business activities. Based on adjusted earnings, the adjusted return on tangible equity measured 12.5% in 2015, which is a level of internal capital generation that supports Berkshire's dividend (36% payout ratio on 2015 adjusted earnings per share) as well as ongoing growth from business activities and further strengthening of the Company's capital metrics. The GAAP return on equity in 2015 was 6.1%.\n\nThere were no significant changes in the cash flow hedges on bank borrowings or the non-hedging derivatives related to mortgage banking. The cash flow hedges consist of $300 million in forward starting three year interest rate swaps which become effective on average in the second quarter of 2016 at an average annual cost of 2.29% and which hedge certain short term FHLBB borrowings. The cost of these hedges will be included in borrowings interest expense when they become effective, which is expected to increase funding costs and decrease the net interest margin as a result. These hedges are an important component of maintaining the Bank's positive interest rate sensitivity. The unrealized loss on these hedges increased to $9 million at the end of the year from $3 million at the start of the year due to the change in market expectations that rates will stay lower for longer compared to earlier expectations. This change was the primary factor in the increase in the overall estimated fair value liability on all derivatives to $11 million from $6 million during the year.\nThe total acquisition cost was $114 million and Berkshire issued 4.2 million common shares as merger consideration, net of 169 thousand shares held by Berkshire. Merger related costs included $8 million in pre-tax merger related costs recorded by Hampden and $11 million recorded by Berkshire. The Company believes that it achieved its goal of 35% cost saves by the end of 2015. The Company has also consolidated three Hampden branches and recorded non-operating restructuring charges in 2015 for these consolidations. The Company estimates that Hampden's operations contributed to improvements in its operating profitability ratios and that these operations will provide additional accretion to earnings in 2016 based on a full year of integrated operations including all targeted cost saves.\nTransaction accounts, which include demand deposit and NOW accounts, increased by 12% in 2015, excluding acquired balances. Most of this growth was in the second half of the year and included strong growth of both personal and commercial account balances. Checking accounts are an important focus of Berkshire's relationship acquisition and development strategies. Total personal deposit accounts were $3.35 billion, or 69% of total deposits excluding brokered time accounts at year-end 2015. This percentage was unchanged from year-end 2014.\nSummary: Berkshire's 2015 results included the Hampden operations acquired in April and the Firestone operations acquired in August. As a result, most measures of revenue, expense, income, and average balances increased compared to 2014. In some cases, this report refers to annualized fourth quarter results to indicate the run rate of operations including the fully integrated acquired businesses.\nFull time equivalent staff totaled 1,091 at year-end 2014, compared to 939 at the prior year-end. This increase included an estimated 92 positions related to the acquired New York branch operations and an additional 6% increase in total staff related to the Company's business growth and expansion, including targeted investment in commercial, retail and wealth management market teams.\nTotal borrowings increased by $212 million, or 20%, to $1.26 billion in 2015. This included $119 million in acquired Hampden borrowings. Acquired Firestone borrowings were replaced with brokered time deposits. Most borrowings are short term; they totaled $1.07 billion, or 85% of total borrowings, at year-end 2015. The weighted average rate on short term borrowings was 0.43% at year-end. FHLBB short term rates are generally priced at a premium of up to 0.25% compared to short term treasury rates, and they are viewed as well correlated with LIBOR. Due to the Federal Reserve Bank's 0.25% hike in the target Fed Funds rate in December 2015, the Company expects the cost of short term borrowings to increase in 2016. Additionally, the cost of interest rate swaps is a component of borrowings interest expense. These swaps are discussed in the following section, and the cost of forward starting swaps becomes effective in 2016 and is expected to contribute to higher borrowing costs in 2016.\nThe credit risk profile of the Company's loan portfolio is described in the Loan Loss Allowance note in the consolidated financial statements. The Company's risk management process focuses primary attention on loans with higher than normal risk, which includes loans rated special mention and classified (substandard and lower). These loans are referred to as criticized loans. Including acquired loans, criticized loans totaled $145 million, or 1.9% of total assets, at year-end 2015 compared to\nTotal non-interest expense increased by $31 million, or 19%, in 2015. Excluding merger and restructuring costs, these expenses increased by $22 million, or 14%. This increase included $16 million in operating expenses of the acquired operations based on their final reported results in the first quarter of 2015. Cost saves related to acquisitions and to restructuring are important\nThe Bank's primary ongoing source of liquidity is customer deposits and the main use of liquidity is the funding of loans and lending commitments. Additional routine sources are borrowings, repayments of loans and investment securities, and the sale of investment securities. The Bank targets to grow customer deposits by increasing its market share among its regions in order to sustain loan growth as a primary component of its strategy. Deposit strategies also consider relative deposit costs as well as relationship and market share objectives. The Bank's acquisition strategy is also targeted to supplement business activities including bank acquisitions and acquisitions of branches, such as the 2014 New York branch purchase. Additionally, the Bank has expanded its use of wholesale funding sources, including borrowings and brokered time deposits. The Company monitors the loans/deposits ratio in assessing directional changes in its liquidity, and in the past has allowed this metric to reach levels near 110% depending on the timing of business activity, while generally keeping it closer to 100% as a working target. The Company also monitors the levels of its wholesale funding in relationship to total assets. Brokered deposits can be more volatile than customer deposits depending on Company and economic events. FHLBB borrowings are in the context of standard, long-term FHLB programs but overall availability is constrained by collateral tests. The Company also monitors the liquidity of\ninvestment securities and portfolio loans and has increased its active management of the loan portfolio to accomplish Company objectives, including liquidity goals. The Bank relies on its borrowings availability with the FHLBB for routine operating liquidity, and has other overnight borrowing relationships for contingency liquidity purposes. In 2015, the Bank increased its pledging of investment securities to support municipal deposits and its use of two way reciprocal money market accounts to provide additional deposit assurance to institutional customers following its termination in the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund. The Bank also expanded its interest rate swaps with national counterparties to provide fixed interest instruments to large commercial borrowers. The Bank has strengthened its liquidity planning and management processes in conjunction with its overall growth and regulatory expectations.\nBerkshire views its internal return on tangible capital as the primary capital resource of the Company. The return on tangible equity has improved, and measured 12.7% in the final quarter of 2015 based on the measure of adjusted earnings. The Company's long term target is a 15% return on tangible equity. A return at or above current levels provides resources for maintaining competitive dividend payouts while also internally supporting strong growth from business activities while maintaining and improving capital metrics.\nAnnual net interest income increased by $35 million, or 20%, in 2015. This included the benefit of an 18% increase in average earning assets as well as an increase in the net interest margin. The growth in earning assets was previously discussed in the changes in financial condition regarding loans and investments, and included the benefit of acquisitions and business activities. Fourth quarter annualized net interest income increased by $48 million, or 26%, to $235 million. The annualized net interest income of the acquired operations was $35 million in their final quarterly reported operations.\nThe commercial loan portfolio increased by $692 million, or 29%, in 2015, including $475 million in acquired loans. The remaining $217 million increase in commercial loans represented 9% organic growth. Most of this growth was in commercial real estate loans, including construction loans, multifamily loans, and non-owner occupied commercial real estate. Recent regulatory pronouncements have reiterated guidance for management of commercial real estate exposures. As measured by\n$130 million, or 2.0% of assets at year-end 2014. The Company views its potential problem loans as those loans from business activities which are rated as classified and continue to accrue interest. These loans have a possibility of loss if weaknesses are not corrected. Classified loans acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value and are classified as performing at the time of acquisition and therefore are not generally viewed as potential problem loans. In 2015, potential problem loans decreased to $61 million from $67 million. Criticized assets include two $10 million secured commercial loan participations related to raw materials companies that are performing and which were downgraded in 2015 due to revenue declines. The Company's evaluation of its credit risk profile also compares the amount of criticized loan and foreclosed assets to the total of the Bank's Tier 1 Capital plus the loan loss allowance. This ratio was 24% at year-end 2015, compared to 28% at the start of the year.\nResults of Segment and Parent Operations. In prior periods, the Company reported two subsidiary operating segments - banking and insurance. Due to growth in the banking segment, the Company determined that as of fiscal year end 2015 it has only one segment based on accounting principles. Accordingly, there is no disclosure of segment and parent operations except for the note in the financial statements regarding the parent. Results for Berkshire Bank in 2015 generally followed the levels and trends of consolidated results. Insurance net income increased modestly in 2015, as earnings benefited from expense reductions that exceeded the modest decrease in revenue.", "item_7_text": "Income Tax Expense. The effective income tax rate of 26% in 2014 was lower than the 29% rate in 2013, including the higher proportionate benefit of tax preference items in 2014 that resulted from the decrease in pre-tax income from year-to-year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was estimated to be 30% in 2014 and 31% in 2013. In both years, this rate was higher than GAAP tax rate due to the lower proportionate benefit of tax preference items compared to the higher adjusted pre-tax income, which excluded net charges related to merger, restructuring, and other designated expense items.\nBerkshire's near term goal is to generate further revenue driven positive operating leverage to improve profitability. The Company is pursuing initiatives to improve fee revenues and non-interest income and the balance sheet will continue to be managed to support profitability, capital, liquidity, and interest rate risk objectives. At year-end 2015, the Company had a pending agreement to purchase a prominent SBA lender scheduled for the first quarter of 2016, which is expected to contribute to these objectives.\nAs noted previously, Berkshire uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted net income to supplement its evaluation of its operating results. Adjusted net income excludes certain amounts not viewed as related to ongoing operations. These items are primarily related to acquisitions and restructuring expenses, together with gains recorded on securities and investments in acquired banks. Berkshire views its net acquisition related costs as part of the economic investment for its acquisitions. These investments are intended to contribute to long term earnings growth and franchise value.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nLoan Loss Allowance. The determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate. The Company's methodologies for determining the loan loss allowance are discussed in Item 1 of this report, and Item 8 includes further information about the accounting policy for the loan loss allowance and the Company's accounting for the allowance in the consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Most of Berkshire's non-interest income is fee income, which generally represents business activities with customers in Berkshire's markets. The Company pursues growth in market share and wallet share across its business lines, including banking, insurance, and wealth management. In commercial banking, Berkshire pursues commercial and industrial loans with relationships that provide non-interest bearing demand deposit balances and that utilize fee services including electronic banking and cash management services. Fee income includes revenues related to the sale of interest rate swap derivative securities to commercial customers, as well as gains recorded on the sale of residential mortgages and commercial loans previously held for investment. Other non-interest income includes non-dividend distributions on investment securities, as well as securities gains/losses which the company excludes from its adjusted earnings. Non-interest income is reduced by the amortization of the Company's recorded investment in tax credit investments which generate offsetting benefits to income tax expense.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe primary liquidity need at the holding company is to support its capital structure, including shareholder dividends and debt service. Additionally, the holding company uses cash to support certain organizational expenses, stock purchases and buybacks, merger related costs, and limited business functions that cannot be performed at the Bank or the insurance subsidiary. The holding company primarily relies on dividends from the Bank to meet its ongoing cash needs. The holding company generally expects to maintain cash on hand equivalent to normal cash uses, including common stock dividends, for at least a one year period. Sources and uses of cash at the parent are reported in the condensed financial statements of the parent company included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. There are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Bank as discussed in the Stockholders' Equity note to the consolidated financial statements. As of year-end 2015, the statutory limit on future dividend payments by the Bank totaled $68 million. This amount is based on retained earnings of the Bank and is expected to be supplemented by future bank earnings in accordance with the statutory formula.\nBorrowings and Other Liabilities. All of Berkshire's senior borrowings at year-end were provided by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston under established relationship programs. The FHLBB is secured by a general pledge of assets primarily consisting of mortgage backed securities and residential mortgages. The Bank uses FHLBB borrowings to manage overnight liquidity and generally to provide funding for its investment portfolio. Other components of the Bank's wholesale funding program include correspondent banks and brokerages, and brokered deposits. For contingency liquidity purposes, the Bank has short term credit arrangements with the Federal Reserve Bank and with certain national banks and brokerages, and the holding company maintains a line of credit. There has been no regular ongoing use of these arrangements. As previously discussed, over the last two years, the Bank has expanded its use of time deposits raised through established broker relationships to fund a portion of loan growth, as an alternative to borrowed funds. The Company evaluates its use of borrowings and of wholesale funds in general in managing its liquidity and strategic growth plans. This is further discussed in the following section on Liquidity.\nLoans. Berkshire posted loan growth of $1.04 billion, or 22%, to $5.7 billion in 2015, of which 14% was contributed as a result of acquisitions and 8% was due to business activities. Growth from business activities was in residential mortgage loans and commercial loans and was a primary focus of the Company's initiatives to increase earnings and profitability. Business activities included both direct originations in market as well as wholesale transactions with other financial institutions. Strategies included targeted remixing of the portfolio to improve pricing spreads and relationship profitability. Despite the ongoing low rate environment, Berkshire achieved an increase in the fourth quarter loan yield to 4.15% in 2015 compared to 3.96% in 2014. The portfolio was further diversified in 2015 and credit metrics improved and remained comparatively strong. The portfolio duration was lengthened modestly to contribute to the yield objective. Through its executive team expansion, Berkshire continues to strengthen its commercial loan oversight and administration and to adhere to its disciplines for credit underwriting and portfolio management. Changes in the portfolio composition in 2015 included runoff of certain balances where competitive pricing and credit conditions for renewing credits were not consistent with the Company's underwriting and pricing guidelines. Berkshire's asset resolution team has continued to generate significant income through recoveries in its collection and resolution of impaired loans acquired in bank acquisitions.\n(2) Consists of leases, bank branches and ATMs through 2039.\nThe Company has increased its utilization of brokered time deposits over the last two years to better manage deposit costs and interest rate risk, and to diversify its funding of loan portfolio growth. Brokered time deposits increased by $404 million to $784 million in 2015. At year-end, the average maturity of this portfolio was 7 months, with an average cost of 0.70%. Additionally, as a result of its DIF insurance termination, the Company has increased its use of reciprocal money market deposits, which offer full insurance to certain commercial and institutional customers in the Company's markets. These balances increased to $102 million from $9 million during the year and are viewed as components of the Company's relationship deposit balances. Also related to the DIF termination, the Company has increased its pledging of investment\nIn the normal course of operations, Berkshire engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in the Company's financial statements. The Company views these transactions as ordinary to its business activities and its assessment is that there are no material changes in these arrangements at year-end 2015 compared to year-end 2014. As previously reported in the discussion of changes in financial condition, Berkshire has outstanding derivative financial instruments and engages in hedging activities, and the fair value of these contracts is recorded on the balance sheet. As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, at year-end 2015, Berkshire had an outstanding agreement to acquire 44 Business Capital, subject to customary regulatory approvals. The Company expects to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of 2016.\nSummary: Berkshire's results in 2014 included the New York branch operations acquired on January 17, 2014. As a result, many measures of revenue, expense, income, and average balances increased compared to prior periods. In 2013, changes in market conditions resulted in a downturn in mortgage banking revenue and accelerated runoff of acquired impaired and non-relationship loans. Quarterly earnings per share decreased to $0.33 in the third quarter of 2013 from $0.48 in the second quarter of 2013. Management reorganized and restructured its expenses in the second half of the 2013, and quarterly earnings improved to $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. Berkshire leveraged its expanded footprint in 2014 with the New York branch purchase and strong loan growth, and earnings per share improved further to $0.46 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted earnings per share advanced to $0.48 in this quarter, which was a 20% improvement from $0.40 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2014, the Company developed revenue synergies, operating efficiencies, and improved product and service capabilities based on the combination of its larger footprint and enhanced infrastructure. Full year net income totaled $33.7 million, or $1.36 per share, in 2014 compared to $41.1 million, or $1.65 per share, in the prior year. These full year changes were the result of the quarterly changes discussed above. Berkshire's adjusted net income measured $1.80 per share in 2014, which was down slightly from $1.87 in the prior year. As noted above, quarterly operating results had rebounded significantly by the end of 2014 while not yet fully recovering to the level of earnings prior to the revenue decline around midyear 2013. The return on equity in the final quarter of 2014 improved to 6.5% and the return on assets improved to 0.71%.\nSUMMARY\nBerkshire favors a profile of net interest income related interest rate risk that is neutral or asset sensitive and accepts a profile of equity at risk which is modestly liability sensitive due to market factors in the ongoing low rate environment. The Bank offers back-to-back interest rate swaps to certain commercial loan customers, which allows the Bank to book a variable rate loan while providing the customer with a contract to fix its interest rate. This allows the Company to be more competitive with national financing sources without booking long-term, fixed rate assets at current low interest rates, as well as providing a source of fee income. At year-end 2015, approximately 32% of the loan portfolio was scheduled to reprice within one year, 27% was scheduled to reprice in one - five years, and 41% was scheduled to reprice over five years. The comparable percentages at the prior year-end were 37%, 24%, and 39% respectively. The duration of the portfolio lengthened modestly in 2015 as part of the Company's strategy for improving the net interest margin. The Company estimated that the fair value of net loans exceeded carrying value by approximately 1.0% at year-end 2015, compared to 1.1% at the start of the year. This decrease reflected the impact of the acquired loans recorded at fair value and higher year-end interest rates, offsetting the benefit of improved asset quality.\nMerger and restructuring expense totaling $8.5 million in 2014 included $5.4 million in merger charges related primarily to the branch acquisition, including professional fees and integration costs with related compensation. Restructuring expenses totaled $3.1 million and included charges related to the Bank's charter change in the third quarter, together with costs for financial systems and certain branch closings and property liquidations. The higher $14.8 million in costs in 2013 were due primarily to the integration of the acquired operations of Beacon Federal Bancorp and the enterprise expense restructuring project that was initiated in the third quarter of that year.\nUnder the Enhanced Prudential Standards which became effective under federal regulation at midyear in 2014, the largest banks are required to adopt a number of practices to manage and reduce liquidity risk. These standards do not apply directly to Berkshire but are affecting U.S. deposit markets. In some circumstances, these standards increase the attractiveness of retail deposits and decrease the attractiveness of large commercial deposits for the largest banks, and these changes may affect the competitive conditions that evolve based on these new standards. Including the acquired Hampden deposits, the Bank's estimate of its total deposit balances which exceed FDIC insurance limits increased to $1.34 billion, or 24% of total deposits at year-end 2015 from $1.07 billion, or 23%, at the start of the year.\nTables with the above information are presented in Item 6 of this report.\nFee income increased by $4 million, or 8%, to $57 million in 2015. Fourth quarter annualized fee income increased by $5 million, or 10%, to $57 million, including the $3 million estimated benefit from acquired operations and net of a $10 million increase in annualized tax credit investment amortization charges. Loan related income increased by $2 million to $8 million for the year. This included a $1 million increase in interest rate swap income to $4 million and a $1 million increase in gains on the sale of seasoned loans to $2 million. Mortgage banking income increased by $2 million to $4 million. Both loan related income and mortgage banking income benefited from higher volume due to low interest rates through much of 2015, as illustrated by the 40 basis point decrease in average ten year U.S. treasury rates to 2.14% in 2015 from 2.54% in the prior year. Additionally, the lower rate environment contributed to wider gain on sale spreads for both mortgage banking revenue and seasoned loan sales. Fee income variances for deposit, wealth, and insurance revenues were no greater than 2% from year to year and generally reflected lower margins on increased business volumes, including lower fee revenue penetration in acquired Hampden operations. Deposit related fee income in 2015 totaled $25 million and included $10 million in overdraft charges, $7 million in card related income, and $8 million in all other deposit related revenue. Annualized fourth quarter deposit related fees declined to 0.46% of average deposits in 2015 from 0.53% in 2014 including the impact of lower Hampden related fees. Wealth management fees in 2015 benefited from higher average securities prices which contributed to portfolio values on which these fees are based.\nThe net unrealized gain on the investment portfolio was $11 million, or 0.8% of cost at year-end. This was down from $18 million, or 1.6% of cost at the start of the year. While average long term interest rates were down in 2015, they increased near year-end following the historic increase in short term rates announced by the Federal Reserve Bank in December. This caused a reduction in unrealized bond gains as of year-end. There were no impairment losses recorded in 2015 and all securities were performing during the year and at year-end.\nTotal Net Revenue. Total net revenue was approximately $226 million in both 2014 and 2013. Annualized net revenue improved to $243 million in the final quarter of 2014, or $9.77 per share. Excluding net securities gains, this represented an increase of 17%, or $35 million, from annualized net revenue in the final quarter of 2013 and was also a 3% increase over the similar measure in 2012. The growth in 2014 included approximately $16 million in anticipated revenue benefit from the acquired New York branches as well as approximately $5 million in benefit from lower borrowing costs related to the hedge termination. Management estimated that fourth quarter revenue increased by approximately 8% from organic growth and business expansion in 2014 from 2013 including volume related increases in both net interest income and fee revenue.\nThe greatest sources of uncertainty affecting liquidity are deposit withdrawals and usage of loan commitments, which are influenced by interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Due to the unusual and prolonged low interest rate environment, there is uncertainty about the behavior of deposits if interest rates increase at some future time as is anticipated. The Company believes that its market positioning and relationship focus will generally enhance the stability of its deposits, and it also models various scenarios for the purpose of contingency liquidity planning. The Bank relies on competitive rates, customer service, and long-standing relationships with customers to manage deposit and loan liquidity. Based on its historical experience, management believes that it has adequately provided for deposit and loan liquidity needs. Both liquidity and capital resources are managed according to policies approved by the Board of Directors and executive management and the Board reviews liquidity metrics and contingency plans on a regular basis. The Bank actively manages all aspects of its balance sheet to achieve its objectives for earnings, liquidity, asset quality, interest rate risk, and capital.\nResidential real estate markets were comparatively strong in Eastern Massachusetts, where the majority of the Company's loan originators are located. Additionally, the Company added to its originations team in other regions in its footprint.\nCOMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses totaled $15.0 million in 2014, compared to $11.4 million in 2013. The provision for loan losses exceeded net loan charge-offs in both years, and resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses related to growth in the loan portfolio during the year.\nSummary: Berkshire continued to extend, deepen, and diversify its banking footprint in 2015. Total assets increased by $1.3 billion, or 20%, to $7.8 billion, including $687 million in assets resulting from the Hampden acquisition and $201 million in assets resulting from the Firestone acquisition. Excluding these acquisitions, organic asset growth totaled $442 million, or 7%, primarily due to 8% loan growth excluding acquired loans. Deposits acquired from Hampden totaled $484 million, and deposit growth from business activities totaled 10% which funded most of the remaining growth in the loan portfolio. The loan/deposit ratio increased slightly to 102% from 101% during the year. The Company's risk management maintained the momentum of favorable and improving asset quality while also producing significant recoveries of purchased impaired loans which contributed to the year's income. The acquisitions were primarily financed with stock consideration and were accretive to Berkshire's capital ratios. Internal capital generation was also sufficient to support growth from business activities, along with a dividend increase and strengthening of capital metrics. Berkshire's focus on improving profitability is targeted to further strengthen internal capital generation as a fundamental element of its capital strength. Berkshire continues to manage its interest rate sensitivity with the goal of benefiting income from expected future increases in interest rates and to limit the risk to income and equity from higher interest rates in the long term.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued a Proposed Accounting Standards Update (Subtopic 825-15), more commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, or CECL. It is proposed to move from an incurred loss model to a life-of-expected loss model. FASB has proposed to remove the probability threshold, adding forecasting, and requiring more in-depth analysis and disclosure for the credit loss estimation. It is anticipated that banks will generally carry higher loan loss allowance estimates as a result of this change and that loan loss estimates be made at acquisition date for loans acquired in business combinations. Further analysis of the impacts of this expected change will depend on final implementation rules.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, Berkshire entered into an agreement to acquire the business model of 44 Business Capital and certain other assets of Parke Bank's SBA 7(a) loan program operations. As part of the agreement, 44 Business Capital's team will join Berkshire. The agreement includes the purchase of SBA loans totaling approximately $38 million that were originated through this team. These loans share pro rata with the SBA in the collateral and creditor rights under the loan agreements.\nGENERAL\nDetermination of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities. The Company evaluates debt and equity securities within the Company's available for sale and held to maturity portfolios for other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI\"), at least quarterly. If the fair value of a debt security is below the amortized cost basis of the security, OTTI is required to be recognized if any of the following are met: (1) the Company intends to sell the security; (2) it is \"more likely than not\" that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) for debt securities, the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For all impaired debt securities that the Company intends to sell, or more likely than not will be required to sell, the full amount of the loss is recognized as OTTI through earnings. Credit-related OTTI for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings. Noncredit related OTTI for such debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. In evaluating its marketable equity securities portfolios for OTTI, the Company considers its intent and ability to hold an equity security to recovery of its cost basis in addition to various other factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer. Any OTTI on marketable equity securities is recognized immediately through earnings. Should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those expected by management, the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements.\nAcquisition related obligations are not included.\nperforming regardless of their payment status. Therefore, some overall portfolio measures of asset quality are not comparable between years or among institutions as a result of recent business combinations. A general goal is to achieve significant resolutions of impaired loans acquired in bank mergers in the first year following the acquisition date. Berkshire's asset quality has reflected its strong credit disciplines together with the generally favorable economic characteristics of its region.\nIn 2014, revenue and expense increased in the first quarter due to the addition of the acquired New York branches. First quarter non-interest income and expense were significantly affected by merger related net charges. As a result, the Company recorded a net loss in the first quarter. Total revenue increased sequentially in each of the next three quarters as business volume growth more than offset a gradual tightening in the net interest margin due to changes in purchased loan accretion and ongoing asset yield compression. The net interest margin increased to 3.23% from 3.20% in the final quarter. Excluding non-operating charges, non-interest expense was generally flat through mid-year. Adjusted expenses increased due to growth in the fourth quarter, and the Company also recorded merger charges related to the pending acquisition of Hampden Bancorp. As a result, net income decreased slightly in the final quarter after rising in the second and third quarters. Fourth quarter net income of $0.46 per share was 10% higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the ongoing benefit of positive operating leverage generated by revenue growth driven by higher volumes.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash needs at all times with available cash and from established external liquidity sources or by conversion of other assets to cash at a reasonable price and in a timely manner. Berkshire evaluates liquidity at the holding company and on a consolidated basis, which is primarily a function of the Bank's liquidity.\nLoan growth from acquisitions in 2015 included the Hampden acquisition in April and the Firestone acquisition in August. The $493 million Hampden loan portfolio consisted largely of Springfield area loans and included $130 million of residential mortgages, $281 million of commercial loans, and $82 million of consumer loans. At acquisition, the portfolio was recorded with a 1.7% discount to Hampden's net carrying value. This $8 million discount included a $12 million discount on purchased credit impaired loans, and a net $4 million premium on non-impaired loans which primarily reflected the premium value of fixed rate loans. Since 2011, Hampden's annual net loan charge-offs averaged less than 0.20% of average loans. The Firestone portfolio consisted of equipment loans to small specialized businesses in a national portfolio which have higher lending spreads that reflect the additional administration that is characteristic of this specialized business line. Berkshire views the credit history of these acquired operations as favorable. The $194 million Firestone portfolio was recorded with a 1.4% discount to net carrying value. This $3 million discount included a $4 million discount on purchased credit impaired loans, and a net $1 million premium on non-impaired loans.\nAll other non-interest income totaled $2.6 million in 2014 and $2.9 million in 2013. Results in 2014 included $3.1 million recorded for the accrual of earnings on bank owned life insurance and were net of $1.5 million in charges representing the book loss on tax shelter investments. These losses are more than offset by tax credit benefits as described in the later section on income tax expense.\nQuarterly Results. Quarterly results for 2015 and 2014 are presented in a note to the consolidated financial statements. Quarterly results were affected by the revenue downturn in 2013 and subsequent actions to improve profitability. Quarterly results have also been affected by purchased loan accretion and by merger and restructuring related net costs. The Company also evaluates adjusted earnings on a quarterly basis to supplement its understanding of operating trends. Based on these evaluations, the Company believed that its adjusted results on a per share basis improved sequentially in all quarters in 2014 and 2015 except for the fourth quarter of 2015 when adjusted results were flat. Similarly, operating profitability determined on an adjusted basis improved throughout 2014 and 2015, although not yet back to levels prevailing at the start of 2013.\nOther Assets. There were immaterial changes in total premises and the category of other assets in 2015 due to the acquisitions and growth in business activities. Total intangible assets increased by $58 million to $335 million due to the goodwill associated with the Hampden and Firestone acquisitions. Intangibles totaled 6.3% of the assets acquired with Hampden and 7.8% of the acquired Firestone assets. Bank owned life insurance and the net deferred tax asset increased primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions. Cash and short term investments increased due to business growth and to high overnight funds at year-end.\nPlease refer to the notes on Recently Adopted Accounting Principles and Future Application of Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\nFinancial results in 2015 included $2 million in pre-tax Firestone merger related charges. The merger consideration paid to shareholders was $56 million, consisting of approximately 75% stock and 25% cash and the Company issued 1.442 million shares as consideration. The Company estimates that this acquisition was accretive to adjusted earnings per share and profitability metrics, as well as to capital ratios. The Firestone merger was estimated as $0.05 dilutive to the Company's tangible book value per share. Berkshire estimated that Firestone operations contributed $0.01 to earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was the first full quarter of combined operations. No cost saves were targeted for this business combination. The Company's goal is that Firestone's operations will produce a double digit return on its equity investment and tangible book value dilution will be repaid from Firestone's operating earnings accretion in 2.5 years.\nIn addition to fee income, non-interest income includes other items, as well as securities/gains losses. Other items include the amortization of the carrying balance in tax credit investment projects, which is more than offset by benefits included in income tax expense. The Company's investment in these projects increased in 2015 due to certain redevelopment projects in its markets which include capital gains credits which are recorded at origination based on future expected capital gains income. This amortization, which is a charge against non-interest revenues, increased to $11 million in 2015 from $2 million in the prior year. These projects are discussed in the following section on income tax expense. Other items included in non-interest income in 2015 were $4 million in accrued income on bank owned life insurance policies and $1 million in distributions on investments. Securities gains/losses in both years consisted of gains on equity securities offset by bond losses. Stock gains totaled $4 million in 2015 as discussed in the earlier section on Investment Securities. In 2014, a $9 million loss was recorded on the termination of hedges as a result of the New York branch purchase; this loss was already recorded in equity and the income statement charge had no direct impact on total equity when it was recorded.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company and the Bank target to maintain sufficient capital to qualify for the Well Capitalized\u201d designation by federal regulators. Berkshire's goal is to use capital efficiently to achieve its objective to become a higher performance company with a targeted return on equity exceeding 10%. A double digit return on equity is used to benchmark all lending and investment programs, together with all acquisition analyses. The Company seeks to maintain a competitive cost of capital and capital structure. The Company generally targets to maintain a ratio of tangible equity/tangible assets in the range of 7-8%.\nPurchased loan accretion totaled $6.7 million in 2014, which was down significantly from $18.1 million in 2013 due to the seasoning of the portfolio. Purchased impaired loans totaled $14 million at year-end 2014, which was 54% of the contractual balance of $26 million of these loans. The unamortized balance of net accretable yield on impaired loans was $2.5 million at year-end 2014 compared to $2.6 million at the start of the year.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe net interest margin was generally declining through 2014 and then expanded in 2015, primarily due to the contribution of the acquired operations. The full year net interest margin increased to 3.31% in 2015 from 3.26% in 2014. The expansion mostly reflected higher yields on commercial loans (due to the acquisitions and the remix of the commercial portfolio) which was partially offset by lower yields on mortgages and consumer loans due to yield compression in the ongoing low rate environment. The improved margin also reflected a modest lengthening of asset durations and shortening of liability durations. The net interest margin was 3.35% in the final quarter of 2015. The Company's goal is to maintain the margin in its business activities but the overall margin is expected to decrease modestly as a result of the additional cost of the forward interest rate swaps that become effective in 2016 as well as less benefit from purchased loan accretion as the portfolio of purchased credit impaired loans is further reduced from ongoing collections activities. The Company's goal is to maintain volume growth and market share improvement that will produce overall growth in net interest income despite possible margin tightening from these factors. As discussed in the following section on Market Risk, the Company expects that there will be ongoing market pressures on the net interest margin if the low interest rate environment persists and if the yield curve flattens, and it is positioned with a target to benefit if interest rates increase from the historic lows seen in recent years.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income is the primary contributor to revenue. Berkshire targets growth in net interest income based on increased business volumes related to market share gains in its markets. Pricing disciplines for loans and deposits target a balance of market share and profitability objectives, while taking into account credit, liquidity, and interest rate sensitivity objectives. The Company also borrows to fund an investment portfolio to contribute to income and profitability, together with other balance sheet objectives. Acquired assets and liabilities are marked to market for carrying value and yield, and balance sheet adjustments are often made at or following the acquisition date to integrate the acquired balance sheet with the Company's balance sheet. In 2015, the most significant adjustment was the replacement of Firestone's borrowings with lower cost brokered time deposits as the primary funding source for that operation. Net interest income includes significant components related to the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and deferred items. The most significant component is purchased loan accretion related to recoveries on the resolution of acquired impaired assets, where Berkshire has regularly posted significant gains that are included in net interest income. These gains are difficult to forecast and are highly variable from quarter to quarter, and generally reflect the Company's strong asset management capabilities and continued strong demand for higher yielding assets in the ongoing low rate environment.\nIn 2015, Berkshire expanded through acquisition and business development, and made progress in rebuilding profitability compared to the prior two years. Berkshire acquired Hampden, a Springfield area community bank, in the second quarter and Firestone, a national specialty equipment finance company, in the third quarter. Business development included ongoing commercial expansion, recruitment of market managers in targeted business lines, and investment in tax advantaged development projects in the Company's footprint. The Company's income also continued to benefit from recoveries achieved on the resolution of impaired loans acquired in recent acquisitions.\nThe Hampden deposit portfolio consisted largely of Springfield area accounts and increased Berkshire's estimated market share to a top four position in that market. These acquired deposits included $97 million in demand deposits, $51 million in NOW accounts, $62 million in money market accounts, $120 million in savings balances, and $154 million in time account balances. Berkshire's deposit cost decreased from 0.44% in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 0.42% in the second quarter of 2015 and then increased to 0.48% in the fourth quarter reflecting higher costs of money market accounts related to targeted promotions.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nMassachusetts, Firestone is a longstanding profitable commercial specialty finance company providing secured installment loan equipment financing for small and medium-sized businesses. Firestone lends nationally, financing fitness equipment, carnival rides and games, amusement and video entertainment, gaming, vending, laundry, and ATM machines. This acquisition provides revenue diversification to Berkshire and increased opportunities for cross sales of existing Berkshire products and services. This business is viewed as complementary to Berkshire's existing specialized financing businesses, including asset based lending and SBA loan programs. Firestone is being operated as a subsidiary of Berkshire Bank and is maintaining its existing operations with a goal of expanding its programs based on Berkshire's increased capital and financing capabilities.\nAsset Quality. Berkshire has a Chief Risk Officer and a Risk Management and Capital Committee of the Board which keep a close focus on maintaining strong asset quality. This includes setting loan portfolio objectives, maintaining sound underwriting, close portfolio oversight, and careful management of problem assets and potential problem assets. Additionally, merger due diligence is an integral component of maintaining asset quality. Acquired loans are recorded at fair value and are deemed\nDeposits. Berkshire's deposits increased by $934 million, or 20%, to $5.6 billion in 2015. This funded most of the 22% increase in the loan portfolio. The acquired Hampden deposits contributed a 10% increase in the portfolio, brokered time deposits contributed 9%, and 3% growth was contributed by transaction account balances. Ongoing business development remains focused on relationship oriented retail and commercial offerings. The Company has actively managed its branch network in recent years. In 2015, the Company added ten branches through the Hampden acquisition and consolidated seven branches and sold its Tennessee branch (related to the 2012 Beacon Federal acquisition). The total branch count was 93 offices at the end of the year, compared to 91 at the start of the year. The Company is evaluating further opportunities for denovo locations and branch designs and technology enhancements, as well as additional sales/consolidations of existing branches. Berkshire continues to diversify its distribution network, including expanding its My Banker and private banking teams and integrating more closely with its wealth management, investment services, small business, insurance, and other business lines. Berkshire also continues to enhance its mobile and electronic delivery channels, and introduced the Apple Pay\u00ae service in 2015. The Company is initiating the rollout of real time customer feedback technology. In 2015, the Company completed its shift away from the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund ( DIF\u201d) due to the Company's growth beyond the DIF insurance limits. There were mix shifts in the deposit portfolio as management adjusted its strategies following the Hampden acquisition and targeted newer market segments and institutional balances.\nThe Bank utilizes the mortgage secondary market as a source of funds for residential mortgages which are sold into that market. This business volume expanded in 2015 as a result of higher residential mortgage demand. Secondary market counterparties include federal mortgage agencies and national financial institutions. The secondary market for jumbo mortgages has been limited in recent years and these mortgages have become more prevalent in the Bank's originations mix. The majority of these loan originations were retained on the Bank's books in 2015. Over the last two years, the Bank has also increased its wholesale purchases and sales of loans including residential mortgages, consumer loans, and commercial loans and loan participations. Commercial loan growth has also included purchases of participations in syndicated loan transactions. These participations are variable rate and the Company views these assets as more liquid and saleable through secondary market channels.\nStockholders' Equity. Berkshire pursues a balance of capital to maintain financial soundness while using common equity efficiently with the goal to produce a strong return on equity and a strong return on tangible equity to support opportunities for franchise growth. Long run growth in dividends and in both book value and tangible book value per share are also viewed as elements for shareholder value creation. A sound capital structure reduces risk and enhances shareholder return and access to\nThe Company realized $4 million in securities gains and $2 million in losses in 2015. The gains were primarily on bank equity securities, including a $2 million gain on the investment in Hampden stock as well as gains on stocks of other banks due to mergers announced by those institutions during the year. The bond losses related primarily to the reduction in non-investment grade bonds in the final quarter due to deteriorating market conditions. In addition to net securities gains, the Company also had a $1 million benefit to non-interest income from special non-dividend distributions received from certain stocks and mutual funds. As a result of its charter change in 2014, the Bank is no longer permitted to invest in new equity securities, but the holding company is permitted to make equity investments subject to certain regulatory restrictions.\nIn addition to fee revenues, non-interest income included an $8.8 million loss recorded on the termination of hedges in 2014 and net securities gains totaling $4.8 million in 2013. The securities gains in 2013 were primarily related to the sale of bank equity securities to realize strong market appreciation on these securities. The hedge termination loss in 2014 was a result of the branch acquisition and is further described in the notes to the financial statements. This loss was the recognition of a fair value loss already recorded in equity and therefore had no direct impact on shareholders' equity when it was recorded.\nThe Company improved its efficiency including the benefit of achieving the targeted 35% cost saves associated with the Hampden acquisition and lowering the funding costs of the Firestone portfolio. Berkshire improved its brand messaging with new brand signage in all locations and targeted promotions with prominent spokespersons. Community support initiatives were expanded, and mobile banking solutions were enhanced including the addition of Apple Pay\u00ae functionality. The Company promoted and reorganized executive management to strengthen leadership across its footprint and business lines.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion. The accounting and reporting policies followed by the Company conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While the Company bases estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe Risk Management and Capital Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight of Berkshire's capital management and plans. The Company is deepening its capital analytics and stress testing capabilities as it grows toward the $10 billion federal regulatory threshold under the Dodd-Frank legislation. While the Company recognizes the potential increased compliance costs and restrictions as growth nears or exceeds that threshold, the Company believes that other size advantages can offset those impacts over time in many markets including its own.\nMortgage banking income decreased by 51% to $2.6 million in 2014 from $5.2 million in the prior year. Berkshire's mortgage banking revenue is recorded on interest rate lock commitments related to loans originated for sale. The volume of these commitments was $304 million in 2014. The Company recorded 2.12% in gross revenue on these commitments and 0.84% net of direct costs of origination in 2014. Wealth management revenue increased by 10% in 2014 to $9.5 million from $8.7 million, including the benefit of higher market prices for assets under management. Total wealth assets under management increased to $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion in 2014.\nThe Company considers the allowance for loan losses appropriate to cover probable losses which can be reasonably estimated and which are inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Under accounting standards for business combinations, acquired loans are recorded at fair value with no loan loss allowance on the date of acquisition. The fair value of acquired loans includes the impact of estimated loan losses for the life of the portfolio, including factors which are not probable or inherent as of the acquisition date, and including subjective assessments of risk. A loan loss allowance is recorded by the Company for the emergence of new probable and estimable losses relating to acquired loans which were not impaired as of the acquisition date. Because of the accounting for acquired loans, some measures of the loan loss allowance are not comparable to periods prior to the acquisition date or to other financial institutions. Loans acquired in business combinations totaled $1.16 billion, or 20% of total loans at year-end 2015, compared to $762 million, or 16% of total loans at year-end 2014.\nThe efficiency ratio improved to 61.3% from 63.2% as the Company pursues its goal to reduce this ratio below 60%. The efficiency ratio improved to 60.6% in the final quarter of the year including Hampden cost saves. The fourth quarter ratio of adjusted non-interest expense to average assets decreased to 2.43% in 2015 from 2.49% in 2014.\nIn 2015, quarterly revenue and expense reflected the Hampden acquisition on April 17 and the Firestone acquisition on August 7. Results also reflected the increased benefit of tax credit related investments beginning in the first quarter. By the fourth quarter, all acquired operations were fully integrated and the Company estimated that it completed the planned Hampden cost saves during the quarter. As a result, fourth quarter operations were generally reflective of the Company's current run rate including the acquired operations. In the preceding discussion of 2015 results, references have been made to fourth quarter adjusted results to demonstrate the full benefit of the year's actions.\nExpense growth in 2015 was mostly in the primary operating expense components of compensation, occupancy, and technology due to the acquisitions and growth in business activities. Full time equivalent staff totaled 1,221 at year-end 2015, a 12% increase from 1,091 a year earlier, including staff related to acquired operations.\nThe Company makes further measurements of fair value of certain assets and liabilities, as described in the related note in the financial statements. The most significant measurements of recurring fair values of financial instruments primarily relate to securities available for sale and derivative instruments. These measurements were included in the previous discussion of changes in financial condition, and were generally based on Level 2 market based inputs. Non-recurring fair value measurements primarily relate to impaired loans, capitalized mortgage servicing rights, and other real estate owned. When measurement is required, these measures are generally based on Level 3 inputs.\nThe year-end 2015 contractual obligations were as follows:\nThis discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report.\nTotal Net Revenue. Berkshire evaluates its top line with the measure of net revenue, which is the sum of net interest income and non-interest income. The Company also evaluates adjusted net revenue in evaluating its operations and the revenue component of its strategies for generating positive operating leverage. Berkshire also measures adjusted revenue per share in evaluating its growth strategies.\nAVERAGE BALANCES, INTEREST, AVERAGE YIELDS/COST AND RATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS\nShareholders' equity increased by $178 million, or 25%, to $887 million in 2015, including $157 million issued for the acquisitions and $27 million in retained earnings. Total shares outstanding increased by 5.791 million, or 23%, to 30.974 million. Book value per share increased by 2% to $28.64 from $28.17. Both acquisitions were modestly dilutive to tangible book value per share as discussed in a later section, but retained earnings were sufficient to boost tangible book value per share by 4% to $17.84 from $17.19. The acquisitions were accretive to the Company's capital ratios, and there was an increase in the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets to 7.4% from 7.0%. Tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by investors and it excludes goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company was within the range of 7 - 8% that it generally targets for this measure and also considers its return on tangible equity as a source of capital strength for improving its condition and supporting its growth. The ratio of equity to assets also increased to 11.3% from 10.9% and the Company's risk based capital ratio improved to 11.9% from 11.4%. The Company's goal is to remain eligible for the regulatory designation of Well Capitalized for the Company and the Bank.\nItem 7 - 7A - Table 1 - Contractual Obligations\nDeposit related fees increased by $6 million, or 34%, to $25 million in 2014, including an estimated $4 million related to the New York branch acquisition. These branches acquired from a national bank had a higher rate of fee income generation compared to the Company's existing deposits. Accordingly, the annualized ratio of deposit fee income to average deposits increased to 0.54% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 0.48% in the same quarter of the prior year. Deposit fees in 2014 included $10 million in overdraft income, $8 million in card fee income, and $7 million in service charge income.\nNet Interest Income. Gross interest income increased by $3 million, or 2%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The average balance of earning assets increased by 18%, which was mostly offset by a decrease in the net interest margin to 3.26% in 2014 from 3.63% in 2013. Total loan interest income decreased by $12 million, or 6%, but this was more than offset by a $15 million, or 85%, increase in securities and other interest income as acquired New York deposits were initially used to fund growth in the securities portfolio. The decrease in loan interest income was due to lower average yields. While average loan balances increased by 11%, the average loan yield decreased to 3.98% in 2014 from 4.69% in 2013. By the fourth quarter, yield\nIncome Taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities. The realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable ordinary income, taxable capital gain income, and the existence of prior years' taxable income, to which \"carry back\" refund claims could be made. A valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that management estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. In determining the valuation allowance, the Company uses historical and forecasted future operating results, including a review of the eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. In particular, income tax benefits and deferred tax assets generated from tax-advantaged commercial development projects are based on management's assessment and interpretation of applicable tax law as it currently stands. These underlying assumptions can change from period to period. For example, tax law changes or variances in projected taxable ordinary income or taxable capital gain income could result in a change in the deferred tax asset or the valuation allowance. Should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those considered by management, the actual realization of the net deferred tax asset could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. If the Company is not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset in excess of the valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made.\nNon-Interest Income. Fee income increased by $3 million, or 6%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Fourth quarter fee income increased by $2 million, or 17%, from year to year. This included an estimated $1 million related to the branch purchase and $1 million related to all other factors. All major categories of fee income were up year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to Berkshire's growth. For the full year, most categories were up except for mortgage banking fee income and other loan related fee income. Due to a spike in interest rates, mortgage banking revenues declined sharply around midyear 2013 from elevated levels that have not recurred and are not expected to recur.\nInterest rates remained low throughout much of the year, and credit conditions in the region continued to be comparatively strong. As a result, industry margins remained under pressure due to ongoing yield compression and competitive conditions. Through its acquisitions and balance sheet strategies, Berkshire increased its net interest margin while also maintaining strong asset performance metrics and maintaining positive asset sensitivity. Growth in the U.S. economy contributed to economic improvement throughout most of the Company's markets, with conditions particularly strong in the Boston and Albany markets.\ncompression had decreased and based on ongoing volume growth, fourth quarter loan interest income increased by 5% over the same period in 2013.\nThe Bank has acquired banks and fee based businesses in recent years. Berkshire's goal is that its stock is the primary capital resource for merger consideration. The Hampden acquisition was 100% for stock and Firestone was 75%. The pending 44 Business Capital acquisition has a small stock component. Through active investor relations, the Company's goal is to maintain a solid profile with the investment community for the purposes of supporting outstanding capital and raising other capital as opportunities arise. The Company has an ongoing universal shelf registration with the SEC to facilitate capital issuances. The Company issued common and preferred stock in the past, as well as senior and subordinated debt.\nExpense growth was mostly in the primary operating expense components of compensation, occupancy, and technology. In total, these costs increased by $17 million, or 16 %, in 2014. Excluding the costs related to the acquired branches, these costs were up an estimated 3% for the year. All other operating costs were down $1.3 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a $2.4 million decrease in professional services from elevated levels in 2013.\nFinancial instruments comprise the majority of the Company assets and liabilities. The net combined fair value of those instruments contributes to the economic value of the Company's equity. This net premium value of financial instruments increased by $108 million to $506 million in 2015, reflecting the benefit of the tangible equity contributed by the acquisitions plus the increase in retained earnings, and less the impact of the lower premium related to loans. Instruments acquired in business combinations were recorded at fair value at acquisition date. These measures do not take into account the non-interest income generated by these customer relationships or the long term intangible value of the Company's franchise in its markets.\nFurther information about borrowings and lease obligations is in the notes on borrowings and commitments to the financial statements.\ncapital markets to support the Company's banking activities and the markets that it serves. In its payment of dividends, management of treasury shares, issuance of equity compensation, and balancing of capital sources, the Company strives to achieve a capital structure that is attractive to the investment community and which satisfies the policy and supervision purposes of the Company's regulators. When Berkshire negotiates business combinations, it generally targets to use its common shares as a significant component of merger consideration and to balance the mix of cash and stock to arrive at targeted capital metrics based on the characteristics of the combined banks. All of the Company's outstanding equity is owned by common stockholders and its stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition to shares held in Treasury, a Bank subsidiary also owns 169 thousand Berkshire shares as a result of the conversion of Hampden shares, and these shares are also excluded from shares outstanding.\nAs a result of the Company's strategies, the fourth quarter yield on the investment portfolio decreased only slightly to 2.96% in 2015 compared to 3.00% in 2014, despite the decrease in rates between those periods. The average life of the bond portfolio was 4.9 years at year-end, compared to 4.5 years at the start of the year.\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nHampden Bancorp Acquisition. The Hampden acquisition was completed on April 17, 2015. Hampden was a community bank headquartered in Springfield, Massachusetts and serving the Springfield area. This in-market merger was targeted to benefit all constituencies, bringing additional products and services to the Hampden customers, providing revenue synergies and cost efficiencies to the combined operations, and boosting Berkshire's Springfield deposit share in the Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area to the top 4 position based on most recent data. Berkshire is the largest Massachusetts based bank now serving the Springfield market. Berkshire consolidated 3 of the Hampden branches in the second quarter and now operates a total of 17 branches in that market, including 7 former Hampden offices.\nBerkshire financed the two acquisitions primarily through the issuance of common stock, which was accretive to most of the Company's capital metrics. The Company completed its transition from the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund ( DIF\u201d), which was initiated in 2014. Demand deposit increases drove organic deposit growth throughout this transition, even while seven branches were being consolidated and one branch was being sold as part of Berkshire's ongoing management of its sales and service channels across its regions. Including the loans acquired with Firestone, the Company increased its utilization of wholesale funding, including expanded use of brokered deposits. Berkshire increased its shareholder dividend and also grew its tangible book value per share as a result of the double digit return on tangible equity.\nThe SEC defines critical accounting policies\u201d as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods. Please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion. Management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the SEC's definition:\nelements of the Company's strategies related to efficiency and return on equity. Based on their final reported results, annualized operating expenses totaled $17 million for Hampden and $10 million for Firestone. The Company believes that it achieved its goal of 35% cost saves for Hampden by the end of 2015. The Company did not target any cost saves for Firestone except for reducing borrowing costs, which are an element of net interest income and were achieved.\nThe notional value of derivatives increased by $332 million, or 32%, to $1.37 billion in 2015. This included $320 million due to growth in commercial loan interest rate swaps, reflecting the improved market demand and the Company's focus on serving this niche, which often involves larger, stronger commercial accounts with other relationship potential. Each such swap involves a derivative sold to the customer and a generally matching derivative purchased from a national counterparty. Accordingly, this net growth reflects about $160 million in underlying loans to provide commercial customers with a contracted fixed rate while allowing the Bank to record a variable rate loan. This net growth from $90 million in the prior year contributed to the increase in loan related fee income previously discussed.\nCOMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nNon-Interest Expense. Total non-interest expense increased by $9 million, or 5%, in 2014. The Company estimated that it added approximately $13 million in annual expense related to the New York branch purchase. Total merger, restructuring, and conversion expense decreased by $6 million to $8 million in 2014. The Company estimated that total non-interest expense increased approximately 2% before the impacts of the branch purchase and the changes in merger, restructuring, and conversion expense. Total non-interest expense decreased to 2.69% of average assets in 2014 from 2.97% in 2013. The Company's non-GAAP measure of adjusted non-interest expense decreased to 2.55% of assets from 2.68 for these respective periods, and decreased further to 2.49 in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOther liabilities increased by $6 million to $91 million in 2015. The balance at year-end 2014 included a $22 million amount payable for commercial loan participation interests purchased at year-end; there was no similar balance due at year-end 2015. This decrease was partially offset by a $10 million increase in the fair value liability of derivative securities which is discussed in a later section, along with growth in operating accruals.\nAcquired Loans. Loans that the Company acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses. Determining the fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. Going forward, the Company continues to evaluate reasonableness of expectations for the timing and the amount of cash to be collected. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows may result in changes in the amortization or accretion of fair market value adjustments, and in some cases may result in the loan being considered impaired. For collateral dependent loans with deteriorated credit quality, the Company estimates the fair value of the underlying collateral of the loans. These values are discounted using market derived rates of return, with consideration given to the period of time and costs associated with the foreclosure and disposition of the collateral.\nsecurities to collateralize certain municipal deposit account balances. Securities pledged to these accounts increased to $136 million from $42 million during the year.\nIn 2015, the Bank's primary uses of funds were loan growth and the replacement of Firestone's borrowings and the primary source of funds were brokered deposits. During the year, the Bank shifted more of its assets into the FHLBB collateral pool, including acquired Hampden assets which Hampden had used for similar purposes. Total FHLBB unused borrowing availability was $576 million at year-end, compared to $246 million at the start of the year.\nBerkshire increased its ownership in investment tax credit entities as an aspect of its overall operating and financial strategy for building customer relationships, supporting its communities, and contributing to profitability. In 2015, the company recorded a $16 million reduction in the income tax provision related to tax credits and deductions generated primarily from investment in historic rehabilitation and low income housing projects. The company recorded an $11 million reduction in the carrying balance as a corresponding charge against non-interest income, with a $5 million resulting net contribution to net income. In 2014, there was a $2.3 million reduction in the tax provision and a $1.5 million charge against non-interest income, resulting in a $0.8 million net contribution to net income. As a result of the tax credit program, the Company's effective income tax rate decreased to 9% in 2015 from 26% in 2014. Measured before the tax credit benefit, the effective income tax rate was 32% in 2015, compared to 30% in 2014. In addition to the tax credit benefit, the Company's effective tax rate also benefits from its investments in municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance.\nRecent results stem from Berkshire's strategy to build profitability and shareholder value through disciplined growth based around the power of its investment in a well-positioned regional franchise and a competitive market position supported by its unique brand and culture. This strategy includes taking advantage of opportunities offered by banks, companies, and teams that are looking for a regional partner to provide the resources necessary to meet market demand economically in light of the regulatory and margin pressures on revenues and earnings. The Company's long term profitability goals include a return on assets exceeding 1% and a double digit return on equity.\nAt year-end 2015, the remaining carrying balance of purchased credit impaired loans was $21 million and the contractual amount owed on these loans was $40 million. The comparable measures at year-end 2014 were $14 million and $26 million, respectively. In 2015, purchased credit impaired loans acquired from Hampden were recorded with a fair value of $17 million compared to a $29 million contractual balance. The balances acquired from Firestone were recorded with a value of $2 million compared to a $5 million contractual balance.\nThe most significant fair value measurements recorded by the Company are those related to assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. These measurements are discussed further in the mergers and acquisitions note to the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded as a result of business acquisitions and combinations. These assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When these assets are evaluated for impairment, if the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to income. The fair value is based on observable market prices, when practicable. Other valuation techniques may be used when market prices are unavailable, including estimated discounted cash flows and analysis of market pricing multiples. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. In the event of future changes in fair value, the Company may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.\nBerkshire's Home Lending operation originated approximately $791 million in residential mortgages in 2015, compared to approximately $546 million in the prior year. A decrease in long term interest rates in the first quarter of 2015 spurred higher refinancing volume in the first half of the year, and originations slowed in the second half of the year.\nBerkshire provides a summary of estimated fair values of financial instruments at each quarter-end. The premium or discount value of loans has historically been the most significant element of this presentation. This discount is a Level 3 estimate and reflects management's subjective judgments. At year-end 2015, the premium value of the loan portfolio was $42 million, or 0.7% of carrying value. The premium value is down from $50 million, or 1.1% of carrying value at year-end 2014. This decrease reflected the impact of the acquired loans recorded at fair value and higher year-end interest rates and spreads, offsetting the benefit of improved asset quality.\n(1) Consists of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The maturities extend through 2027 and the rates vary by borrowing.\nTotal Comprehensive Income. Berkshire's total comprehensive income in 2015 was $40 million, compared to $49 million in the prior year. The $16 million increase in net income was offset by a $25 million decrease in other comprehensive income due primarily to a net $22 million after-tax change in available for sale securities from an unrealized gain in 2014 to an unrealized loss in 2015. The change in securities fair value was discussed in an earlier section of this report. The increase in the unrealized loss on the Company's forward starting interest rate swaps on borrowings also contributed to the decrease in other comprehensive income in 2015.\n_______________________________\nregulatory categories, the commercial real estate portfolio measured 232% of the Bank's risk based capital at year-end 2015 and commercial construction loans measured 40% of risk based capital. The growth of commercial and industrial loans in 2015 was primarily due to the Firestone acquisition, and including the impact of this change, the Company reduced certain other C&I exposures to support its objectives for improving the net interest margin and overall return on equity. The Company has no significant direct exposure to the oil and gas industries. During the year, certain relationships were outplaced or released to competition based on the Company's pricing and credit disciplines. Improvements in the loan yield and in asset quality included the benefit of these activities. In the final quarter of the year, the yield on commercial loans before purchased loan accretion was 4.27% which was increased significantly from 3.90% in the final quarter of 2014 due to the acquisition, growth, and mix strategies.\nLIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS\nBerkshire continues to focus on strategic commercial loan growth to increase earnings, market share, and business relationships, while taking advantage of its size and geographic positioning to gain market share from national banks. The Bank's commercial banking teams operate out of its seven commercial regional offices to provide commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans together with commercial depository and banking services, as well as insurance and wealth management services. The Bank also has an asset based lending group based in its Burlington, MA office which services the entire footprint. The addition of Firestone represents an expansion of Berkshire's commercial specialty lending operations and is the first line of business with a national footprint. The Company's growing small business banking team is part of the Bank's retail organization and small business loans are included in commercial loan totals. This team improved its competitive position and was a leader in SBA lending in several of Berkshire's regions in 2015. The planned acquisition of 44 Business Capital will broaden and strengthen Berkshire's SBA lending capabilities and add the Mid-Atlantic and other geographies to its lending operations. These expanded SBA operations will also add a secondary marketing and loan servicing capacity which is expected to diversify revenues, expand product competitiveness, and lead to further business volume growth. This complements the expanded wholesale component of the Company's lending operations which include regional and national loan participations as well as loan purchases and potential sales of targeted commercial loan products.\nIncome Tax Expense. Berkshire utilizes several tax strategies which allow the Company to operate in a tax effective manner and deliver tax savings. As a result, the Company's effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate based on the federal and state income taxes in its market area. The Company participates in federal and state tax credit programs and other tax advantaged investment opportunities which are encouraged under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has also established security corporation subsidiaries and, through its subsidiaries, purchases tax exempt bonds. In 2014, the Company increased its resources in its tax management function and is pursuing additional opportunities to develop tax effective strategies which will deliver additional tax benefits and tax savings based on its expanded footprint and operating activities.\nBerkshire has also emphasized the development of its SBA loan program and has achieved a leading position as an originator of SBA guaranteed loans in several of its regional markets. Commercial loans secured with government guarantees increased to $39 million from $16 million in 2015. Near the end of 2015, Berkshire announced an agreement to acquire the lending team of 44 Business Capital, a nationally ranked SBA originator that will further contribute to the growth and diversification of Berkshire's SBA lending business.\nThe underwriting parameters for the lending operations of Firestone and 44 Business Capital reflect the specialized nature of these operations and are in some respects outside of Berkshire's traditional underwriting guidelines. Berkshire views the credit histories of these operations as favorable and has established controls to integrate these operations into its credit administration processes. They are expected to enhance the Company's product capabilities and diversify its relationship base and related revenues and credit risk characteristics.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAt year-end 2015, the company's other assets included a $3 million unamortized balance of the company's equity ownership interest in these entities. A deferred tax asset related to these programs includes a $3 million federal tax credit carryforward from past investment in new markets and renewable energy projects. The tax credit carryforward is expected to be realized in the future based on the company's ability to generate sufficient future ordinary operating income. The company recorded an additional $3 million deferred tax asset with respect to future expected capital losses from investment in historic rehabilitation and low income housing projects. This is the Company's first significant utilization of capital gain related tax benefits and realization of those benefits depends on realization of projected future capital gains. The company expects to realize the tax benefit from these capital losses in the future based on the company's ability to generate future capital gain income from a variety of sources. Investment tax credit programs depend on federal tax policy and administrative rulings and the future availability of such programs depends on future policy and administrative processes.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities. Berkshire utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk of its borrowings, to offer these instruments to commercial loan customers for similar purposes, and as part of its residential mortgage banking activities. The instruments sold to commercial and residential mortgage customers are an important source of fee income. Demand for these products tends to vary inversely with the direction of interest rates, and they are more popular when interest rates are decreasing and customers wish to lock in long term fixed interest rates that the Company cannot offer directly based on its own funding sources.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nMerger and restructuring expense totaled $18 million in 2015, compared to $8 million in the prior year. These expenses in 2015 included $11 million related to Hampden, $2 million related to Firestone, and $5 million related to restructuring including the 8 branches that were consolidated or sold. Berkshire has consistently focused on managing its branch network in recent years through a combination of consolidations, closings, sales and relocations, as well as purchasing branches and open de novo offices. In 2014, merger costs included $4 million for the New York branch acquisition and $2 million for Hampden, and restructuring costs totaled $2 million. Merger related costs primarily consist of severance costs, contract termination charges, professional fees, and variable compensation costs.\nAt year-end 2015, the holding company had $36 million in cash and equivalents, compared to $31 million at the start of the year. The Parent's cash is held on deposit in the Bank. The Bank paid $28 million in dividends to the holding company in 2015, which was an increase from $12 million in 2014, when the Bank retained more earnings to support the New York branch purchase. Dividends to the holding company from the insurance subsidiary totaled $6 million in 2015, and no such dividends were paid in 2014. The holding company has a $10 million unsecured line of credit, which was fully utilized at the start of 2015 and which was unused at year-end 2015.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by the Company. The level of the allowance is a critical accounting estimate, which is subject to uncertainty. The level of the allowance was included in the discussion of financial condition. The provision for loan losses totaled $17 million in 2015, compared to $15 million in 2014. The provision for loan losses exceeded net loan charge-offs in both years, and resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses related primarily to growth in the loan portfolio during the year.\nFirestone Financial Acquisition. The Firestone acquisition was completed on August 7, 2015. Based in Needham,\nTotal annual net revenue increased by $42 million, or 18%, to $268 million in 2015. Annualized net revenue totaled $284 million in the final quarter of the year, when both acquisitions were fully integrated. Annual results included a 20% increase in\nThe financial statements and related financial data presented in this Form 10-K have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Bank are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Bank's performance than the general level of inflation. Interest rates may be affected by inflation, but the direction and magnitude of the impact may vary. A sudden change in inflation (or expectations about inflation), with a related change in interest rates, would have a significant impact on our operations.\nnet interest income and a 14% increase in non-interest income. Fee income decreased to 21% of net interest and fee income in 2015 from 23% in 2014. Berkshire's long term goal is to increase fee income to 30% of total revenue by increasing wallet share through cross sales, product expansion, and balance sheet management. The decrease in the fee income contribution in 2015 was due to the lower fee product penetration of the acquired businesses. Berkshire believes that these acquired operations present fee revenue synergy opportunities that may be developed in the future. Both acquisitions were funded significantly with stock consideration, and fourth quarter annualized revenue per share decreased to $9.25 in 2015 from $9.77 in 2014. The acquired businesses reported $39 million in annualized net revenue in the first quarter of 2015, the final reported quarter prior to acquisition. These acquired revenues contributed most of the Company's revenue growth during the year, and totaled $6.93 per share based on the 5.6 million shares issued as merger consideration. Due to their higher profitability after cost saves at Hampden and improved funding costs at Firestone, both of these businesses were expected to contribute a double digit return on equity to future results.\nThe contribution of purchased loan accretion to net interest income was $7.6 million in 2015, including $2.4 million in the final quarter of the year. This accretion was $6.7 million in 2014. For the above respective periods, the net interest margin measured before purchased loan accretion was 3.19%, 3.22%, and 3.16% respectively. Most purchased loan accretion results from recoveries on the resolution of purchased credit impaired loans resulting from bank mergers. The fair market value of these loans is normally significantly discounted from the contractual and carrying value at the time of the merger and Berkshire's team has produced significant recoveries of value as a result of its asset management disciplines and improving market conditions for impaired assets as a result of the economic recovery and ongoing low interest rates. At year-end 2015, Berkshire's remaining carrying amount for these loans was $21 million, which was a 47% discount from the contractual balance of $40 million. This discount included a balance of $7 million in accretable discount which was expected to be recorded as interest income through the ongoing performance of these loans. The new impaired loans acquired as a result of the Hampden and Firestone transactions had a total carrying balance of $34 million which had a market discount of 46%, resulting in an $18 million carrying balance for Berkshire.\n(3) Consists of obligations with multiple vendors to purchase a broad range of services.\nInvestment Securities. Berkshire's goal is to maintain a high quality portfolio consisting primarily of liquid investment securities with managed durations to limit the potential for market value declines in rising rate markets. Berkshire focuses on loan growth as the primary use of funds and the primary source of interest income. The investment portfolio is an additional source of interest income and also provides additional liquidity and interest rate risk management flexibility. The Company evaluates the portfolio within its overall objectives of producing growth in earnings per share and contributing to return on equity. The Company continuously evaluates options for managing the portfolio's size, yield, diversification, risk, and duration.\nThe Company reports adjusted earnings per share excluding specified items. The effective tax rate on these adjusted earnings per share was estimated to be 15% in 2015. This rate was higher than the 9% GAAP tax rate in 2015 due to the lower proportionate benefit of tax advantaged items compared to the estimated adjusted pretax income. The 15% rate was lower than the 30% equivalent rate in 2014 due to the increased tax credit benefits recorded in 2015. The Company expects that the tax rate on adjusted earnings per share will revert back to the 2014 levels at the beginning of 2016. The Company expects to record additional tax credit benefits in the second half of 2016 as a result of additional investments in related projects, with the result that the full year rate on adjusted earnings is expected to be below 30%. The anticipated merger expenses for 44 Business\nThe consumer loan portfolio increased by $34 million, or 4%, to $802 million in 2015 due to $82 million in acquired Hampden balances. Excluding the acquired balances, the portfolio decreased by $48 million, or 6% due to planned runoff of indirect auto loans. In the latter part of 2014, the Company changed its strategy to de-emphasize lower rate super prime indirect auto loans as part of its net interest margin strategy, and the indirect auto portfolio has declined steadily since that time. In the third quarter of 2015, Berkshire announced the recruitment of a new team leader to expand the Company's network for prime indirect auto paper and the Company expects that consumer loan outstandings will increase in 2016 as this team builds new business volume, and the Company contemplates potential secondary market sales of indirect auto loans in future years based on its fee income and balance sheet strategies. The consumer loan portfolio yield decreased to 3.30% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 3.35% in the final quarter of 2014 due to ongoing yield compression and the Company's origination strategies. The portfolio yield was increasing in the second half of 2015, including the benefit of the acquired Hampden loans and the aging and runoff of the older super prime loans. The Company's goal is to maintain the yield of this portfolio and to gradually increase it if interest rates remain steady or increase.\nIn 2015, the portfolio was generally managed to maintain yield in the ongoing environment of low interest rates and yield compression. The most significant activity related to the integration of the acquired Hampden securities portfolio. Total securities increased by $165 million, or 14%, to $1.371 billion in 2015. This included $72 million of investment securities and $83 million in cash and short term investments acquired with Hampden Bank. Hampden had liquidated a portion of its $145 million year-end 2014 investment portfolio prior to the merger and some of these amounts were reinvested by Berkshire. The overall duration of these investments was lengthened to support a higher earnings contribution from the acquired Hampden operations, and the resulting growth in Berkshire's portfolio was concentrated in medium term agency collateralized mortgage obligations and long term municipal bonds. Most acquired municipal bonds were designated as held to maturity as part of the Company's balance sheet strategies to manage the market price risk reflected in its equity capital. In addition to its activities with investment grade securities, the Bank reduced its investment in non-investment grade securities in 2015. Investments in bank capital instruments were reduced as a result of new regulatory requirements that increased the required capital support for these investments. The Bank reduced its investment in equity securities and trust preferred securities by $23 million in 2015.\nDue to the stock issued as merger consideration, the Company estimates that the Hampden acquisition improved the ratio of tangible equity/tangible assets and also contributed positively to regulatory capital ratios. The merger was estimated as $0.33 dilutive to Berkshire's tangible book value per share. The Company estimated that the acquired operations contributed $0.02 to earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2015, including estimated 35% cost saves which were completed in the fourth quarter. The Company continues to target tangible book value dilution payback within approximately 3 years from the merger date based on merger related adjusted EPS accretion. The Company also continues to target double digit long run return on the equity invested in this acquisition.\nNon-Interest Expense. Berkshire's goal is to generate positive operating leverage, growing revenues through market share expansion and maintaining expense management disciplines. Non-interest expense increases have generally been related to the Company's growth, including the impact of acquisitions. The Company also invests in building its infrastructure and adding to its market teams, with a focus on fee generating business lines, as part of its long term strategy to occupy a leading position as a regional provider in its footprint. Expense results also include merger and restructuring costs which the Company excludes from its measure of adjusted earnings. The Company views merger related costs as part of the economic investment in acquired businesses. Restructuring costs have included the write-off of uneconomic contracted costs including contracts of acquired operations, as well as ongoing costs to optimize the branch network in light of market changes for branch services based on the emergence of mobile banking as well as changes in customer access patterns.\nLoans classified as accruing troubled debt restructurings decreased to $12 million from $13 million during the year. Foreclosed real estate was unchanged at $2 million. Accruing loans over 90 days past due improved to 0.06% from 0.8% of total loans, and loans delinquent 30-89 days improved to 0.32% from 0.42% of total loans.\nThe Company viewed its asset quality as comparatively good and improving in 2015 based on both its loans from business activities as well as acquired loans. The Company viewed the overall environmental factors as supportive of this assessment, including economic conditions and real estate market conditions and values.\nCOMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nNet loan charge-offs were 0.25% of average loans in 2015, compared to 0.29% in the prior year. Year-end 2015 non-performing assets decreased to $23 million, or 0.29% of total assets, from $24 million, or 0.37% of total assets, at the start of the year. For loans from business activities, net loan charge-offs measured 0.26% of average loans in 2015, while this measure was 0.23% for average loans acquired in business combinations.\nThe Company originates a significant portion of its mortgages for sale to manage interest rate risk associated with fixed rate mortgages. Revenue is recorded at the time that the application is rate-locked. The Company originated $438 million in rate-locks of held for sale mortgages in 2015, compared to $304 million in the prior year. Most jumbo mortgages are retained due to the lack of secondary market demand, and much of the Eastern Massachusetts production consists of jumbo mortgages due to elevated home prices in that region. Rate lock income on mortgages originated for sale is the primary component of Berkshire's mortgage banking fee income. Net of acquired Hampden loans and net of secondary market sales and other wholesale purchases and sales of residential mortgages, the mortgage portfolio increased by $189 million, or 13% in 2015. Wholesale purchases of mortgages in and around Berkshire's markets totaled $124 million and wholesale sales of seasoned mortgages totaled $121 million. Gains on seasoned loan sales are a component of other loan related non-interest income. Due to ongoing interest rate compression, the yield on the portfolio decreased to 3.72% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 3.88% in the same quarter of 2014.\nThe overall yield on earning assets decreased to 3.73% in the fourth quarter of 2014 from 3.97% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding purchased loan accretion, the yield decreased to 3.62% from 3.73%. The cost of funds decreased to 0.52% from 0.73% including the benefit of the hedge terminations in the first quarter. Through its balance sheet management, Berkshire was able to offset the earning asset yield compression so that the fourth quarter 2014 net interest margin of 3.23% was only down by 0.03% compared to 3.26% in 2013. Excluding purchased loan accretion, the fourth quarter margin improved to 3.12% from 3.07% in those same periods.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses represents probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio at the financial statement date and which may be estimated. Management uses historical information, as well as current economic data, to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors, which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen. Although management believes that it uses appropriate available information to establish the allowance for loan losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. Conditions in the local economy and real estate values could require the Company to increase provisions for loan losses, which would negatively impact earnings.\nCapital are not significant and therefore the expected GAAP effective tax rate in 2016 is not expected to be significantly different from the rate on adjusted earnings, based on conditions known at the start of the year.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Trading assets, securities available for sale, and derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, or to establish a loss allowance or write-down based on the fair value of impaired assets. Further, the notes to financial statements include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the valuation methodologies used and its impact to earnings. For financial instruments not recorded at fair value, the notes to financial statements disclose the estimate of their fair value. Due to the judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimation process, the estimates could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.\nThe total amount of the allowance increased in 2015, while the ratio of the allowance to total loans decreased to 0.69% from 0.76%. For loans from business activities, this ratio decreased to 0.76% of total loans from 0.84%. For loans acquired in business combinations, the ratio increased slightly to 0.41% from 0.38%. The year-end allowance provided 3.0X coverage of total net charge-offs in 2015, compared to 2.8X in 2014. The allowance provided 1.9X coverage of year-end non-accrual loans in 2015 compared to 1.6X in 2014.\n2015 results demonstrated a rebound from lower profitability in 2014. The adjusted return on assets increased to 0.85% in the fourth quarter of 2015 from a low of 0.71% in the second quarter of 2014. This included the benefit of an increase in the net interest margin to 3.35% from 3.26% for these dates, and an improvement in the efficiency ratio to 60.6% from 63.0%. The GAAP return on assets in these periods was 0.82% and 0.75% respectively, and included net merger and restructuring charges The increase in profitability included the benefit of positive operating leverage produced by growth from acquisitions and business activities. Based on adjusted earnings, the adjusted return on tangible equity measured 12.5% in 2015, which is a level of internal capital generation that supports Berkshire's dividend (36% payout ratio on 2015 adjusted earnings per share) as well as ongoing growth from business activities and further strengthening of the Company's capital metrics. The GAAP return on equity in 2015 was 6.1%.\n\nThere were no significant changes in the cash flow hedges on bank borrowings or the non-hedging derivatives related to mortgage banking. The cash flow hedges consist of $300 million in forward starting three year interest rate swaps which become effective on average in the second quarter of 2016 at an average annual cost of 2.29% and which hedge certain short term FHLBB borrowings. The cost of these hedges will be included in borrowings interest expense when they become effective, which is expected to increase funding costs and decrease the net interest margin as a result. These hedges are an important component of maintaining the Bank's positive interest rate sensitivity. The unrealized loss on these hedges increased to $9 million at the end of the year from $3 million at the start of the year due to the change in market expectations that rates will stay lower for longer compared to earlier expectations. This change was the primary factor in the increase in the overall estimated fair value liability on all derivatives to $11 million from $6 million during the year.\nThe total acquisition cost was $114 million and Berkshire issued 4.2 million common shares as merger consideration, net of 169 thousand shares held by Berkshire. Merger related costs included $8 million in pre-tax merger related costs recorded by Hampden and $11 million recorded by Berkshire. The Company believes that it achieved its goal of 35% cost saves by the end of 2015. The Company has also consolidated three Hampden branches and recorded non-operating restructuring charges in 2015 for these consolidations. The Company estimates that Hampden's operations contributed to improvements in its operating profitability ratios and that these operations will provide additional accretion to earnings in 2016 based on a full year of integrated operations including all targeted cost saves.\nTransaction accounts, which include demand deposit and NOW accounts, increased by 12% in 2015, excluding acquired balances. Most of this growth was in the second half of the year and included strong growth of both personal and commercial account balances. Checking accounts are an important focus of Berkshire's relationship acquisition and development strategies. Total personal deposit accounts were $3.35 billion, or 69% of total deposits excluding brokered time accounts at year-end 2015. This percentage was unchanged from year-end 2014.\nSummary: Berkshire's 2015 results included the Hampden operations acquired in April and the Firestone operations acquired in August. As a result, most measures of revenue, expense, income, and average balances increased compared to 2014. In some cases, this report refers to annualized fourth quarter results to indicate the run rate of operations including the fully integrated acquired businesses.\nFull time equivalent staff totaled 1,091 at year-end 2014, compared to 939 at the prior year-end. This increase included an estimated 92 positions related to the acquired New York branch operations and an additional 6% increase in total staff related to the Company's business growth and expansion, including targeted investment in commercial, retail and wealth management market teams.\nTotal borrowings increased by $212 million, or 20%, to $1.26 billion in 2015. This included $119 million in acquired Hampden borrowings. Acquired Firestone borrowings were replaced with brokered time deposits. Most borrowings are short term; they totaled $1.07 billion, or 85% of total borrowings, at year-end 2015. The weighted average rate on short term borrowings was 0.43% at year-end. FHLBB short term rates are generally priced at a premium of up to 0.25% compared to short term treasury rates, and they are viewed as well correlated with LIBOR. Due to the Federal Reserve Bank's 0.25% hike in the target Fed Funds rate in December 2015, the Company expects the cost of short term borrowings to increase in 2016. Additionally, the cost of interest rate swaps is a component of borrowings interest expense. These swaps are discussed in the following section, and the cost of forward starting swaps becomes effective in 2016 and is expected to contribute to higher borrowing costs in 2016.\nThe credit risk profile of the Company's loan portfolio is described in the Loan Loss Allowance note in the consolidated financial statements. The Company's risk management process focuses primary attention on loans with higher than normal risk, which includes loans rated special mention and classified (substandard and lower). These loans are referred to as criticized loans. Including acquired loans, criticized loans totaled $145 million, or 1.9% of total assets, at year-end 2015 compared to\nTotal non-interest expense increased by $31 million, or 19%, in 2015. Excluding merger and restructuring costs, these expenses increased by $22 million, or 14%. This increase included $16 million in operating expenses of the acquired operations based on their final reported results in the first quarter of 2015. Cost saves related to acquisitions and to restructuring are important\nThe Bank's primary ongoing source of liquidity is customer deposits and the main use of liquidity is the funding of loans and lending commitments. Additional routine sources are borrowings, repayments of loans and investment securities, and the sale of investment securities. The Bank targets to grow customer deposits by increasing its market share among its regions in order to sustain loan growth as a primary component of its strategy. Deposit strategies also consider relative deposit costs as well as relationship and market share objectives. The Bank's acquisition strategy is also targeted to supplement business activities including bank acquisitions and acquisitions of branches, such as the 2014 New York branch purchase. Additionally, the Bank has expanded its use of wholesale funding sources, including borrowings and brokered time deposits. The Company monitors the loans/deposits ratio in assessing directional changes in its liquidity, and in the past has allowed this metric to reach levels near 110% depending on the timing of business activity, while generally keeping it closer to 100% as a working target. The Company also monitors the levels of its wholesale funding in relationship to total assets. Brokered deposits can be more volatile than customer deposits depending on Company and economic events. FHLBB borrowings are in the context of standard, long-term FHLB programs but overall availability is constrained by collateral tests. The Company also monitors the liquidity of\ninvestment securities and portfolio loans and has increased its active management of the loan portfolio to accomplish Company objectives, including liquidity goals. The Bank relies on its borrowings availability with the FHLBB for routine operating liquidity, and has other overnight borrowing relationships for contingency liquidity purposes. In 2015, the Bank increased its pledging of investment securities to support municipal deposits and its use of two way reciprocal money market accounts to provide additional deposit assurance to institutional customers following its termination in the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund. The Bank also expanded its interest rate swaps with national counterparties to provide fixed interest instruments to large commercial borrowers. The Bank has strengthened its liquidity planning and management processes in conjunction with its overall growth and regulatory expectations.\nBerkshire views its internal return on tangible capital as the primary capital resource of the Company. The return on tangible equity has improved, and measured 12.7% in the final quarter of 2015 based on the measure of adjusted earnings. The Company's long term target is a 15% return on tangible equity. A return at or above current levels provides resources for maintaining competitive dividend payouts while also internally supporting strong growth from business activities while maintaining and improving capital metrics.\nAnnual net interest income increased by $35 million, or 20%, in 2015. This included the benefit of an 18% increase in average earning assets as well as an increase in the net interest margin. The growth in earning assets was previously discussed in the changes in financial condition regarding loans and investments, and included the benefit of acquisitions and business activities. Fourth quarter annualized net interest income increased by $48 million, or 26%, to $235 million. The annualized net interest income of the acquired operations was $35 million in their final quarterly reported operations.\nThe commercial loan portfolio increased by $692 million, or 29%, in 2015, including $475 million in acquired loans. The remaining $217 million increase in commercial loans represented 9% organic growth. Most of this growth was in commercial real estate loans, including construction loans, multifamily loans, and non-owner occupied commercial real estate. Recent regulatory pronouncements have reiterated guidance for management of commercial real estate exposures. As measured by\n$130 million, or 2.0% of assets at year-end 2014. The Company views its potential problem loans as those loans from business activities which are rated as classified and continue to accrue interest. These loans have a possibility of loss if weaknesses are not corrected. Classified loans acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value and are classified as performing at the time of acquisition and therefore are not generally viewed as potential problem loans. In 2015, potential problem loans decreased to $61 million from $67 million. Criticized assets include two $10 million secured commercial loan participations related to raw materials companies that are performing and which were downgraded in 2015 due to revenue declines. The Company's evaluation of its credit risk profile also compares the amount of criticized loan and foreclosed assets to the total of the Bank's Tier 1 Capital plus the loan loss allowance. This ratio was 24% at year-end 2015, compared to 28% at the start of the year.\nResults of Segment and Parent Operations. In prior periods, the Company reported two subsidiary operating segments - banking and insurance. Due to growth in the banking segment, the Company determined that as of fiscal year end 2015 it has only one segment based on accounting principles. Accordingly, there is no disclosure of segment and parent operations except for the note in the financial statements regarding the parent. Results for Berkshire Bank in 2015 generally followed the levels and trends of consolidated results. Insurance net income increased modestly in 2015, as earnings benefited from expense reductions that exceeded the modest decrease in revenue.", "item_7_tables": "Table 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than One\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to Three\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to Five\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After Five\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLBB borrowings (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,174,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,123,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,429,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,151,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Berkshire's net income increased by $16 million to $54 million in 2015 compared to 2014, largely due to two acquisitions - Hampden Bank in April 2015 and Firestone Financial in August 2015.
