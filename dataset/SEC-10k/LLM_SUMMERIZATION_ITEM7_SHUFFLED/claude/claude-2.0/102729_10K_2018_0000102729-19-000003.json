MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nForward-Looking Statements\nManagement's discussion and analysis, and other sections of this annual report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that management has made in light of experience in the industries in which the Company operates, as well as management's perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions. Many factors could affect the Company's actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things, risk factors described from time to time in the Company's reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as future economic and market circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results, operating efficiencies, availability and price of raw materials, availability and market acceptance of new products, product pricing, domestic and international competitive environments, and actions and policy changes of domestic and foreign governments.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

compared with 2017, was due to higher sales in the ESS and Coatings segments that were offset by lower sales in the Irrigation, Utility, and Other segments. The changes in net sales in 2018, as compared with 2017, were as follows: Table 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,746.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>912.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>856.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>256.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>644.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>(100.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pricing/mix\n</td> <td>114.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition/(divestiture)\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency translation\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,757.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>967.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>855.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes. On the first day of fiscal 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard (\"ASC 606\"). Within the Utility Support Structures segment, the steel and concrete product lines now recognize revenue over time whereas in 2017 and years prior, their revenue was recognized at a point in time, which was typically upon product delivery to the customer. The impact of the adoption of ASC 606 in 2018 was an increase in sales of $36.4 million and an increase in operating income of $6.2 million primarily in the Utility segment. It is not practicable to estimate the sales volumes attributable to the adoption of ASC 606 and thus is not a separate line item in the table above. Information on the adoption of the revenue standard can be found under Critical Accounting Policies within Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nAverage steel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate were higher in North America and China in 2018, as compared to 2017, resulting in higher average cost of material. In general, the average selling prices increased during the year to mitigate decrease in gross profit realized from the higher cost of steel for the Company.\nThe Company acquired the following companies during 2018:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Torrent Engineering and Equipment (\"Torrent\") in the first quarter of 2018 that is included in our Irrigation segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Derit Infrastructure Pvt.

The grinding media business is reported in Other and the loss was recorded in other income (expenses) on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nRestructuring Plan\nIn February 2018, the Company announced a restructuring plan related to certain operations in 2018, primarily in the ESS segment, through consolidation and other cost-reduction activities (the \"2018 Plan\"). The Company incurred pre-tax expenses from the 2018 Plan of $34.0 million. The decrease in 2018 gross profit and operating income due to restructuring expense by segment is as follows:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Corporate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrency Translation\nIn 2018, we realized a reduction in operating profit, as compared with fiscal 2017, due to currency translation effects. The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Corporate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nAt a consolidated level, the reduction in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2018, as compared with 2017, was primarily due to restructuring costs incurred in the ESS and Utility segments. The Irrigation and Coatings segments realized an increase in gross margin in 2018, while Utility, ESS, and Other realized a decrease in gross margin.\nThe Company saw an increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to impairment of the goodwill and trade name of the Offshore and other complex structures (\"Offshore\") business totaling $15.8 million, restructuring costs incurred of $15.6 million, SG&A from recently acquired businesses of $9.0 million, and acquisition diligence expenses of $4.4 million. The increase was partially offset by lower deferred compensation expenses of $5.0 million (offset recognized in other expense as described below) and $3.6 million of SG&A in 2017 from the grinding media business divested in 2018.\nOperating income was lower for all reportable segments with the exception of Coatings in 2018, as compared to 2017. The decrease is attributed to the impairment of the goodwill and trade name of the Offshore business, restructuring costs incurred in the ESS and Utility segments, and the disposal of the grinding media business included in Other.\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nNet interest expense for 2018 was consistent with 2017. The Company issued $200.0 million and $55.0 million of senior secured notes in June 2018 at 5.0% and 5.25%, respectively. Proceeds from the debt issuance were subsequently used to pay off the 2020 bonds in July 2018.\nThe approximate $14.8 million in pre-tax costs ($11.1 million after-tax) associated with refinancing of debt is due to the Company's repurchase through tender of $250.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes due 2020. This expense was comprised of the following:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash prepayment expenses of approximately $15.8 million; plus\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recognition of $1.0 million of expense comprised of the write-offs of unamortized loss on the cash flow hedge and deferred financing costs; less\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recognition of $2.0 million of the unamortized premium originally recorded upon the issuance of the 2020 notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Income/Expense\nThe change in other income/expense in 2018, as compared with 2017, was primarily due to the divestiture of our grinding media business that resulted in a loss of approximately $6.1 million. Excluding the divestiture, higher other income was driven by a periodic pension benefit in 2018 that resulted a beneficial change of $2.8 million. In addition, the change in market value of the Company's shares held of Delta EMD was an improvement of $0.8 million. The remaining change was due to more favorable foreign currency transaction gains/losses in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in other income was partially offset by a change in valuation of deferred compensation assets in 2018 which resulted in additional expense of $5.0 million. This amount is offset by a reduction of the same amount in SG&A expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective income tax rate in 2018 and 2017 was 30.1% and 46.5%, respectively. The 2018 tax rate was impacted by the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% offset by 2018 restructuring costs and impairment charges for which no tax benefits have been recorded. The 2017 tax rate was impacted by The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\" or Act\u201d) which resulted in a one-time fourth quarter of 2017 charge of approximately $42 million related to the transition effects of the Act. Excluding this charge, our effective tax rate would have been 28.1% for 2017.\nThe $42 million charge was comprised of (a) approximately $9.9 million of expense related to the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings (\"transition tax\"), the federal portion of which is payable over eight (8) years beginning in 2018, (b) approximately $20.4 million of expense related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax balances to reflect the new U.S. corporate income tax rate, using a federal and state tax rate of 25.0%, and (c) approximately $11.7 million of deferred expenses related to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. During 2018, the Company finalized the transition tax which resulted in a credit to tax expense of $0.5 million.\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was consistent in 2018 and 2017.\nCash Flows from Operations\nOur cash flows provided by operations was $153.0 million in 2018, as compared with $133.1 million provided by operations in 2017. The increase in operating cash flows was due to lower contributions to the Delta pension plan partially offset by lower net earnings.\nEngineered Support Structures (ESS) segment\nThe increase in sales in 2018, as compared with 2017, was due to higher sales pricing to cover the higher costs of steel and sales volume increases from acquisitions in 2018.\nGlobal lighting and traffic, and highway safety product sales in 2018 were $73.4 million higher as compared to 2017, due to higher sales pricing and increased sales volumes. Sales volumes and pricing in North America were higher across commercial and transportation markets and also increased due to the acquisition of Walpar in the third quarter of 2018. Improved sales volumes in Europe contributed to higher sales in 2018, as compared to 2017, along with favorable currency translation effects as the value of the euro appreciated against the U.S. dollar. Sales volumes in Asia-Pacific were higher in India due to improved demand, offset by lower demand in China for lighting and traffic products. Highway safety product sales increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to higher demand in Australia and the acquisition of Aircon in the third quarter of 2017.\nCommunication product line sales were lower by $21.9 million in 2018, as compared with 2017. In North America, communication structure and component sales increased in 2018 due to strong demand from the network expansion by providers. In Asia-Pacific, sales volumes decreased due to much lower demand in China for new wireless communication structures.\nAccess Systems product line net sales decreased in 2018 by $2.7 million, as compared to 2017. The decrease can be attributed to lower sales volumes in Asia due to less large project work that was partially offset by improved demand in Australia, in part due to efforts to expand our sales reach into architectural and construction markets.\nGross profit, as a percentage of sales, and operating income for the segment were lower in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to restructuring costs incurred in 2018. In 2018, the segment incurred $14.3 million of restructuring costs within product cost of sales and $14.2 million within SG&A expense. In addition, approximately $8.0 million of asset impairment costs were incurred related to exiting certain local markets in 2018. SG&A spending was higher in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to restructuring costs and SG&A expenses of Walpar that was acquired in the third quarter of 2018. Operating income decreased primarily from the the $28.5 million of incurred restructuring costs.\nUtility Support Structures (Utility) segment\nIn the Utility segment, sales decreased in 2018, as compared with 2017, due to lower sales volumes in North America that are offset by sales price increases to cover higher steel costs and the acquisition of Convert and Derit in the\nthird quarter of 2018. A number of our sales contracts in North America contain provisions that tie the sales price to published steel index pricing at the time our customer issues their purchase order. Measured in tonnages, sales volumes for steel utility structures in North America were lower whereas concrete utility structure sales volumes were higher in 2018, as compared to 2017. The Company adopted new revenue recognition guidance effective the first day of fiscal 2018; steel and concrete reported sales in 2017 were recognized upon delivery to customers (point in time) whereas reported revenue for 2018 is based on progress of production on customer orders (over time).\nOffshore and other complex structures sales decreased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to lower sales volumes that were partially offset by positive effects from currency translation.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales decreased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to restructuring costs incurred of $4.1 million and lower offshore and complex steel structures sales volumes. SG&A expense was higher in 2018, as compared with 2017, due to the goodwill and trade name impairment recorded for Offshore business of $15.8 million, restructuring expenses, and increased expenses related to the acquisition of Derit and Convert. Excluding restructuring expenses, expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the intangible asset impairment, operating income in 2018 was consistent with 2017.\nCoatings segment\nCoatings segment sales increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to increased sales prices to recover higher zinc costs globally and higher sales volumes. The Company acquired Derit in the third quarter of 2018 and CSP Coatings in the fourth quarter of 2018 that also contributed to higher sales. Sales pricing and volume demand increased in North America in 2018, as compared to 2017. In the Asia-Pacific region, continued improvements in the Australia market along with overall higher sales pricing provided an increase in net sales.\nSG&A expense was higher in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to higher compensation costs related to improved business operations and currency translation effects. Non-recurring items were recognized in 2018 and 2017 which reduced SG&A. 2018 included the reversal of an environmental remediation liability related to one of our North America galvanizing locations of $1.9 million; in 2017 the business recorded a reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million due to the sale of a former galvanizing operation in Australia. Operating income was higher in 2018 compared to 2017, due to improved sales volumes and the associated operating leverage of fixed costs and improved sales pricing.\nIrrigation segment\nThe decrease in Irrigation segment net sales in 2018, as compared to 2017, is primarily due to sales volume decreases, particularly in the international markets. The decrease in international sales can be attributed to project delays and lower overall large project work across most regions. In addition, the weakening of the Brazilian real and Argentina peso in 2018 resulted in lower sales due to currency translation. North America sales increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to higher sales pricing and recent acquisitions. Sales volumes in North America for the year were lower due to continued weak farm income levels. Recent proposed tariffs also caused uncertainly leading farmers to delay irrigation purchases.\nSG&A was lower in 2018, as compared to 2017. The decrease can be attributed to lower incentives from reduced business operations and currency translation effects which were partially offset by expenses associated with the 2018 acquisitions. Operating income for the segment decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, due to lower sales volumes and the associated operating deleverage of fixed costs and currency translation effects.\nOther\nIn April 2018, the Company completed the sale of Donhad, a mining consumable business with operations in Australia. The Company realized an approximate $6.1 million loss on the sale that is recorded in other income/expense, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\nLIFO expense\nSteel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate, and zinc in the U.S. increased at a higher rate in 2018, as compared to 2017, resulting in higher LIFO expense.\nNet corporate expense\nCorporate SG&A expense was lower in 2018 as compared to 2017. The decrease can be attributed to lower deferred compensation expenses of $5.0 million, which is offset by the same amount in other expense, and lower incentive expense. The decrease was partially offset by higher compensation expenses.\nFISCAL 2017 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2016\nOverview\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our management and reporting structure changed to reflect management's expectations of future growth of certain product lines and to take into consideration the expected divestiture of the grinding media business, which historically was reported in the Energy and Mining segment. The access systems applications product line is now part of the Engineered Support Structures (\"ESS\") segment and the offshore and other complex structures product line is now part of the Utility segment. Grinding media will be reported in \"Other\" pending the completion of its divestiture. In the first quarter of 2017, we also changed our reportable segment operating income to separate out the LIFO expense (benefit). Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO method in the consolidated financial statements. Our segment discussions and segment financial information have been accordingly reclassified in this report to reflect this change, for all periods presented.\nOn a consolidated basis, the increase in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, reflected higher sales in all reportable segments. The changes in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, were as follows: Table 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,521.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>891.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>735.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>97.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>61.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pricing/mix\n</td> <td>102.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency translation\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,746.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>912.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>856.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>256.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>644.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes.\nAverage steel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate were higher in North America and China in 2017, as compared to 2016, resulting in higher average cost of material. We expect that average selling prices will increase over time to offset the decrease in gross profit realized from the higher cost of steel for the Company. The Company acquired a highway business in India (\"Aircon\") in the third quarter of 2017 that is included in the ESS segment.\nRestructuring Plan\nIn 2016, we executed a restructuring plan in Australia/New Zealand focused primarily on closing and consolidating locations within the ESS and Coatings segments (the \"2016 Plan\"). We incurred $7.8 million of restructuring expense consisting of $5.0 million in cost of goods sold and $2.8 million in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2016. The Plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2016.\nIn 2015, we executed a broad restructuring plan (the \"2015 Plan\") to respond to the market environment in certain of our businesses. During 2016, we incurred approximately $4.6 million of restructuring expense to complete the 2015 Plan consisting of $4.1 million in SG&A expense with the remainder recorded in cost of goods sold.\nCurrency Translation\nIn 2017, we realized a benefit to operating profit, as compared with fiscal 2016, due to currency translation effects. The U.S. dollar primarily weakened against the Brazilian real and South African rand, resulting in more operating profit in U.S. dollar terms. The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>Corporate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nAt a consolidated level, the reduction in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2017, as compared with 2016, was primarily due to higher cost of raw materials across most of our businesses. The Utility segment realized an increase in gross margin in 2017, while ESS, Irrigation, and Coatings realized a decrease in gross profit primarily due to sales pricing that did not fully recover higher raw material costs and unfavorable sales mix. Lower volumes for Coatings and Other also contributed to the reduction in gross margin through deleverage of fixed costs.\nThe Company saw an increase within SG&A expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to the following:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher employee incentives of $5.0 million due to improved business operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reversal of $3.2 million of a contingent consideration liability in 2016 to the former owners of an acquired business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased project and promotional expenses of $3.2 million, primarily in the irrigation segment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher deferred compensation expenses of $2.7 million, which was offset by a decrease of the same amount of other expense; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>currency translation effects of $1.9 million (higher SG&A) due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and South African rand against the U.S. dollar.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above increases were partially offset by the following decreases in SG&A expense in 2017 as compared to 2016:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 totaling $6.8 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million related to land of a former galvanizing operation in Australia that was sold in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, as compared to 2016, operating income for all operating segments were higher except for the ESS segment and Other. The increase in operating income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily attributable to increased sales volumes in the Utility and Irrigation segments, along with restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 and the associated benefits of the restructuring activities.\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nNet interest expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, was lower as interest income increased due to more cash on hand to invest. Long-term and short-term borrowings were consistent year-over-year.\nOther Income/Expense\nThe decrease in other income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily due to the reversal of a contingent liability provision of approximately $16.6 million in 2016, out of \"Other noncurrent liabilities.\"\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective income tax rate in 2017 and 2016 was 46.5% and 19.1%, respectively. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\" or Act\u201d) includes a number of changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that impact corporations beginning in 2018; including a reduction in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limiting or eliminating certain tax deductions, and changing the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings. Accordingly, the Company recorded a one-time charge of approximately $42 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the transition effects of the Act. Excluding this charge, our effective tax rate would have been 28.1% for 2017. The $42 million charge is comprised of (a) approximately $9.9 million of expense related to the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings, the federal portion of which is payable over eight (8) years beginning in 2018, (b) approximately $20.4 million of expense related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax balances to reflect the new U.S. corporate income tax rate, using a federal and state tax rate of 25.0%, and (c) approximately $11.7 million of deferred expenses related to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. These amounts are provisional and our estimates and overall impact of the Act may change for various reasons including, but not limited to, changes in our interpretation and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by governing authorities, and tax planning actions we may undertake. We continue to gather additional information to fully account for the Act. Any updates and changes in the estimates will be communicated in future quarterly financial statements.\nTax expense in 2016 included $30.6 million of deferred income tax benefit attributable to the remeasurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Company's U.K. defined benefit pension plan. In addition, we recorded a $9.9 million valuation allowance against a tax credit for which we believe we are not likely to receive the benefit in 2016. Excluding these items as well as the impact of the reversal of the contingent liability of $16.6 million that is not taxable, our adjusted effective tax rate was 30.8% for 2016 versus the GAAP reported effective tax rate of 19.1%.\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was higher in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved earnings for our majority-owned irrigation businesses.\nCash Flows from Operations\nOur cash flows provided by operations was $133.1 million in 2017, as compared with $232.8 million provided by operations in 2016. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to less favorable working capital changes driven by higher receivables and inventory and higher contributions to the Delta Pension Plan in 2017.\nEngineered Support Structures (ESS) segment\nThe increase in sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, was due to improved roadway product sales volumes and communication product line sales volumes. Global lighting and traffic, and roadway product sales in 2017 were higher compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased sales volumes in roadway product sales, which is a product line outside of North America. In 2017, as compared to 2016, sales volumes in the U.S. were lower across commercial and transportation markets. The 2015 long-term U.S. highway bill has not yet provided a meaningful uplift for our North America structures business. Sales in Europe were lower in 2017 as the domestic markets in general remain subdued. The increase in sales for global lighting and traffic, and roadway product is also attributed to currency translation effects and the acquisition of Aircon in the third quarter of 2017.\nCommunication product line sales were higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. In North America and Asia-Pacific, communication structure and component sales increased due to higher demand from the continued network expansion by providers.\nAccess systems product line net sales in 2017 were higher than in 2016, due to higher average sales prices and favorable currency translation effects.\nGross profit, as a percentage of sales, and operating income for the segment were lower in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to margin contraction from higher raw material costs that the business was not able to fully recover through higher sales pricing. SG&A spending was lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to lower commissions owed on communication product line sales, reduced incentives due to decreased operating performance, and restructuring costs and activities undertaken in 2016 to reduce the cost structure primarily in the access systems business in Australia.\nUtility Support Structures (Utility) segment\nIn the Utility segment, sales increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to improved volumes and higher sales prices due to steel cost increases and a favorable sales mix. A number of our sales contracts contain provisions that tie the sales price to published steel index pricing at the time our customer issues their purchase order. Improved sales demand in North America resulted in increased sales volumes in tons for both steel and concrete utility structures that also contributed to the increase in sales. International utility structures sales decreased in 2017 due to lower volumes.\nOffshore and other complex structures sales decreased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes that were partially offset by favorable currency translation effects.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved pricing and sales mix and higher sales volumes in North America and improved factory performance for the offshore and other complex structures business. SG&A expense was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to higher incentive expense due to improved operations and commission expense attributed to the increased sales volumes. Operating income increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to the increased sales volumes and improved pricing and sales mix in North America.\nCoatings segment\nCoatings segment sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased sales prices to recover higher zinc costs globally. External sales volumes decreased while intercompany volumes increased in North America during 2017. In the Asia-Pacific region, improved demand/volume in Australia along with currency transaction effects led to an increase in sales in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nSG&A expense was lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower compensation costs and no restructuring expense in 2017. Both 2017 and 2016 had non-recurring transactions recognized as reductions in SG&A. A former galvanizing operation in Australia was sold in 2017 allowing for a reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million. In 2016, a contingent consideration liability to the former owners of an acquired business was reduced $3.2 million due to changes in estimated earnings over the earn-out period. Operating income was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to lower SG&A expenses.\nIrrigation segment\nThe increase in Irrigation segment net sales in 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to sales volume increases for both domestic and international irrigation and currency translation effects. In North America, when comparing 2017 to 2016, sales volumes increased driven by markets outside the traditional corn-belt. In addition, higher equipment running times due to weather conditions resulted in higher service parts sales. International sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to volume increases in the Middle East and South America and favorable foreign currency translation effects for Brazil and South Africa.\nSG&A was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. The increase can be attributed to higher incentive and commission costs due to improved business results, increased product development and promotional expenses, and currency translation effects related to the international irrigation business. Gross profit and operating income for the segment increased in 2017 over 2016, primarily due to North America and international irrigation sales volume increases and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nOther\nGrinding media sales decreased from lower volumes. A decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by higher sales pricing and favorable currency translation effects. Gross profit and operating income were lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes.\nLIFO expense\nSteel index prices for both hot rolled coil, plate, and zinc in the U.S. increased at a higher rate in 2017, as compared to 2016, which drove higher LIFO expense.\nNet corporate expense\nNet corporate expense is similar when comparing 2017 to 2016. Approximately $4 million of increased incentive expense was offset by lower pension expense and better performance of the Company's U.S. medical plan as compared to 2016.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nWorking Capital and Operating Cash Flows-Net working capital was $931.6 million at December 29, 2018, as compared with $1,069.6 million at December 30, 2017. The decrease in net working capital in 2018 mainly resulted from lower cash balances mostly attributed to the investing outflow for acquisitions and financing outflow for stock repurchases, and an increase in accrued expense for the Convert contingent consideration liability. Operating cash flow was $153.0 million in 2018, as compared with $133.1 million in 2017 and $232.8 million in 2016. The increase in operating cash flow in 2018, as compared to 2017, was due to lower contributions to the Delta Pension Plan in 2018 partially offset by lower net earnings.\nInvesting Cash Flows-Capital spending in fiscal 2018 was $72.0 million, as compared with $55.3 million in fiscal 2017 and $57.9 million in fiscal 2016. Capital spending projects in 2018 included investments in machinery and equipment across all businesses. The increase in investing cash outflows in 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to business\nacquisitions totaling $143.0 million ($5.4 million in 2017) that was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the grinding media business of $62.5 million. We expect our capital spending for the 2019 fiscal year to be approximately $90.0 million.\nFinancing Cash Flows-Our total interest-bearing debt decreased to $753.3 million at December 29, 2018, from $755.0 million at December 30, 2017. During 2018 and 2016, we acquired approximately 0.8 million shares and 0.4 million shares for $114.8 million and $53.8 million, respectively, under the share repurchase program. No shares were repurchased in 2017.\nCapital Allocation Philosophy\nWe have historically funded our growth, capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing. In May 2014, our Board of Directors approved and publicly announced a capital allocation philosophy with the following priorities for cash generated:\n\u2022working capital and capital expenditure investments necessary for future sales growth;\n\u2022dividends on common stock in the range of 15% of the prior year's fully diluted net earnings;\n\u2022acquisitions; and\n\u2022return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases.\nWe also announced our intention to manage our capital structure to maintain our investment grade debt rating. Our most recent ratings were Baa3 by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and BBB+ by Standard and Poor's Rating Services. We would be willing to allow our debt rating to fall to BBB- to finance a special acquisition or other opportunity. We expect to maintain a ratio of debt to invested capital which will support our current investment grade debt rating.\nThe Board of Directors in May 2014 authorized the purchase of up to $500 million of the Company's outstanding common stock from time to time over twelve months at prevailing market prices, through open market or privately-negotiated transactions. The Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million of share purchases, without an expiration date in both February 2015 and again in October 2018. The purchases will be funded from available working capital and short-term borrowings and will be made subject to market and economic conditions. We are not obligated to make any repurchases and may discontinue the program at any time. As of December 29, 2018, we have acquired approximately 5.4 million shares for approximately $732.6 million under these share repurchase programs.\nSources of Financing\nOur debt financing at December 29, 2018 consisted primarily of long-term debt. During 2018, the Company issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% senior notes due 2044 and $55 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% senior notes due 2054 and redeemed $250.2 million in remaining aggregate principal amount of the 2020 senior notes. Our long-term debt as of December 29, 2018, principally consists of:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$450 million face value ($436.1 million carrying value) of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 5.00% per annum and are due in October 2044.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$305 million face value ($297.4 million carrying value) of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 5.25% per annum and are due in October 2054.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We are allowed to repurchase the notes subject to the payment of a make-whole premium.

The credit facility provides for $600 million of committed unsecured revolving credit loans. We may increase the credit facility by up to an additional $200 million at any time, subject to lenders increasing the amount of their commitments. The Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries Valmont Industries Holland B.V. and Valmont Group Pty. Ltd., are authorized borrowers under the credit facility. The obligations arising under\nthe credit facility are guaranteed by the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries PiRod, Inc., Valmont Coatings, Inc., Valmont Newmark, Inc. and Valmont Queensland Pty. Ltd.\nThe material amendments to the credit facility, which are set forth in the amended and restated credit agreement, include:an extension of the maturity date of the credit facility from October 17, 2019 to October 18, 2022;\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in the available borrowings in foreign currencies from $200 million to $400 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a modification of the definition of \"EBITDA\" to add-back non-recurring cash and non-cash restructuring costs in an amount that does not exceed $75 million in any trailing twelve month period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a modification of the leverage ratio permitting it to increase from 3.5X to 3.75X for the four consecutive fiscal quarters after certain material acquisitions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>updating the credit facility with certain market provisions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The interest rate on our borrowings will be, at our option, either:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>LIBOR (based on a 1, 2, 3 or 6 month interest period, as selected by us) plus 100 to 162.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table> (b) the higher of\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the prime lending rate,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>LIBOR (based on a 1 month interest period) plus 100 basis points (inclusive of facility fees),\n</td> </tr>\n</table> plus, in each case, 0 to 62.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\nA commitment fee is also required under the revolving credit facility which accrues at 10 to 25 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard and Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investor Services, Inc., on the average daily unused portion of the commitment under the revolving credit facility.\nAt December 29, 2018, we had $5.7 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility has a maturity date of October 18, 2022 and contains certain financial covenants that may limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement. At December 29, 2018, we had the ability to borrow $579.7 million under this facility, after consideration of standby letters of credit of $14.6 million associated with certain insurance obligations. We also maintain certain short-term bank lines of credit totaling $137.7 million; $127.0 million of which was unused at December 29, 2018.\nOur senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreement each contain cross-default provisions which permit the acceleration of our indebtedness to them if we default on other indebtedness that results in, or permits, the acceleration of such other indebtedness.\nThese debt agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities, including capital expenditures. These debt agreements allow us to add estimated EBITDA from acquired businesses for periods we did not own the acquired businesses. The debt agreements also provide for an adjustment to EBITDA, subject to certain specified limitations, for non-cash charges or gains that are non-recurring in nature.\nOur key debt covenants are as follows:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Leverage ratio - Interest-bearing debt is not to exceed 3.50x Adjusted EBITDA (or 3.75x Adjusted EBITDA after certain material acquisitions) of the prior four quarters; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Interest earned ratio - Adjusted EBITDA over the prior four quarters must be at least 2.50x our interest expense over the same period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements. The key covenant calculations at December 29, 2018 were as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>753,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA-last four quarters\n</td> <td>336,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage ratio\n</td> <td>2.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA-last four quarters\n</td> <td>336,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense-last four quarters\n</td> <td>44,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest earned ratio\n</td> <td>7.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe calculation of Adjusted EBITDA-last four quarters is presented under the column for fiscal 2018 in footnote (b) to the table \"Selected Five-Year Financial Data\" in Item 6 - Selected Financial Data.\nOur businesses are cyclical, but we have diversity in our markets, from a product, customer and a geographical standpoint. We have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage through business cycles and maintain liquidity. We have consistently generated operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures. Based on our available credit facilities, recent issuance of senior unsecured notes and our history of positive operational cash flows, we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs for fiscal 2019 and beyond.\nWe previously considered the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no related deferred income taxes. Prior to the 2017 Tax Act, we had an excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, including unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $400 million. While the tax on these foreign earnings imposed by the 2017 Tax Act ( Transition Tax\u201d) resulted in the reduction of the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, an actual repatriation from our non-U.S. subsidiaries may still be subject to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes.\nAs a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we reassessed our position with respect to the approximately $400 million of unremitted foreign earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our position is that the previously deferred earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries that were subject to the Transition Tax are not indefinitely reinvested. Further, in 2018 we have taken the position on non-U.S. subsidiaries we are not indefinitely reinvested on their 2018 unremitted foreign earnings. Of our cash balances of $313.2 million at December 29, 2018, approximately $203.6 million is held in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Consequently, with the change in our position on unremitted foreign earnings, if we distributed our foreign cash balances certain taxes would be applicable. At December 29, 2018, we have a liability for foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes of $3.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\nFINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS\nWe have future financial obligations related to (1) payment of principal and interest on interest-bearing debt, (2) Delta pension plan contributions, (3) operating leases and (4) purchase obligations. These obligations at December 29, 2018 were as follows (in millions of dollars):\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>772.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>763.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>1,144.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>950.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delta pension plan contributions\n</td> <td>140.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>146.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase commitments\n</td> <td>94.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,298.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,860.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term debt mainly consisted of $755.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes. At December 29, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $5.7 million under our bank revolving credit agreement. Obligations under these agreements may be accelerated in event of non-compliance with debt covenants. The Delta pension plan contributions are\nrelated to the current cash funding commitments to the plan with the plan's trustees. Operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business.\nUnconditional purchase commitments relate to purchase orders for zinc, aluminum and steel, all of which we plan to use in 2019, and certain capital investments planned for 2019. We believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period. The unconditional purchase commitments also includes the January 2019 purchase of the non-controlling interests of Walpar, LLC for $23.1 million as contractually required per the purchase agreement.\nAt December 29, 2018, we had approximately $13.0 million of various long-term liabilities related to certain income tax and other matters. These items are not scheduled above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any potential payments. The contingent consideration payment for Convert Italia SpA has also been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule as the payment is not fixed but dependent on the business exceeding a profitability target for calendar 2018. The $11.6 million accrual at December 29, 2018 is an estimate which will be finalized during the second quarter of 2019.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment. These leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts. We also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts.\nMARKET RISK\nChanges in Prices\nCertain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price. The most significant materials are steel, aluminum, zinc and natural gas. Over the last several years, prices for these commodities have been volatile. The volatility in these prices was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply and demand conditions, government tariffs and the costs of steel-making inputs. Steel is most significant for our utility support structures segment where the cost of steel has been approximately 50% of the net sales, on average. In 2018, we began using steel hot rolled coil derivative contracts on a limited basis to mitigate the impact of rising steel prices on operating income. Assuming a similar sales mix, a hypothetical 20% change in the price of steel would have affected our net sales from our utility support structures segment by approximately $64 million for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nWe have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years. Our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to reduce the volatility in our purchase prices and sales price increases where possible. We use natural gas swap contracts on a limited basis to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income.\nRisk Management\nMarket Risk-The principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. At times, we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures, but we do not use derivatives for trading purposes.\nInterest Rates-Our interest-bearing debt at December 29, 2018 was mostly fixed rate debt. Our notes payable and a small portion of our long-term debt accrue interest at a variable rate. Assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would have affected our interest expense in 2018 and 2017 by approximately $0.1 million. Likewise, we have excess cash balances on deposit in interest-bearing accounts in financial institutions. An increase or decrease in interest rates of ten basis points would have impacted our annual interest earnings in 2018 and 2017 by approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nForeign Exchange-Exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency are not material, and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings, fair value and cash flows from these transactions are not material. The Company is also exposed to investment risk related to foreign operations. From time to\ntime, as market conditions indicate, we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with anticipated future transactions, current balance sheet positions, and foreign subsidiary investments that are in currencies other than the functional currencies of our businesses. At December 29, 2018, the Company had two oustanding foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate foreign currency risk of the Company's investment in its Australian dollar and Euro denominated businesses. The forward contracts, which qualify as net investment hedges, have a maturity date of May 2020 and notional amounts to sell Australian dollars and Euro to receive $100.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively. On August 24, 2018, the Company entered into three fixed-for-fixed cross currency swaps ( CCS\u201d), swapping U.S. dollar principal and interest payments on a portion of its 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2044 for Danish krone (DKK) and Euro denominated payments. The CCS were entered into in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on the Company's Euro and DKK investments and to reduce interest expense. The notional of the two Euro and DKK CCS are $35.0 million and $60.0 million, respectively, and they mature in 2020 to 2023.\nAt December 30, 2017, the Company had open foreign currency forward contracts that qualified as net investment hedges. The purpose of the net investment hedges were to mitigate foreign currency risk on a portion of our foreign subsidiary investments in the grinding media business that are denominated in British pounds and Australian dollars. The divestiture of our grinding media business was pending at the end of 2017 and was finalized in the second quarter of 2018. The forward contracts had a maturity date in the first quarter of 2018 and a notional amount to sell British pounds and Australian dollars and receive $24.1 million and $21.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts, the most significant of which was a one-year foreign currency forward contract which qualified as a net investment hedge, in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on a portion of our foreign subsidiary investments denominated in British pounds. The notional amount of this forward contract to sell British pounds was $44.0 million and the contract was settled in May 2017. Much of our cash in non-U.S. entities is denominated in foreign currencies, where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in U.S. dollar terms. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately $18.5 million in 2018 and $37.2 million in 2017.\nWe manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities or by utilizing hedging instruments (as discussed above) where appropriate. The following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our most significant investments at year-end assuming a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar.

Steel prices are volatile and we may utilize derivative instruments to mitigate commodity price risk on fixed price orders. In 2018, the Company entered into steel hot rolled coil forward contracts which qualified as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash flows attributable to future steel purchases. The forward contracts had a notional amount of $8,469 for the purchase of 3,500 short tons for each month from July 2018 to September 2018 and a notional amount of $15,563 for the purchase of 6,500 short tons for each month from October 2018 to December 2018.\nNatural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories, especially in our Coatings segment galvanizing operations, where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot-dipped galvanizing process. Natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments. Our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for 0-50% of our U.S. natural gas requirements for the upcoming 6-12 months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on NYMEX futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged. The objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden, significant increases in the price of natural gas. At December 29, 2018, we have no natural gas swaps outstanding.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements. We must make estimates on a number of items, such as impairments of long-lived assets, income taxes, revenue recognition for the product lines recognized over time, inventory obsolescence, and pension benefits. We base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Further, we re-evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change. Actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions. The selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed annually with our audit committee.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions. We have assigned useful lives to our property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from 3 to 40 years. Impairment losses were recorded in 2018 as facilities were closed and certain fixed assets are no longer expected to be used as a result of our restructuring plans.\nWe identified thirteen reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill and we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter, which usually coincides with our strategic planning process. We assess the value of our reporting units using after-tax cash flows from operations (less capital expenses) discounted to present value and as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the discount rate and the projected cash flows. We also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units.\nOur most recent impairment test calculated an estimated fair value of our Offshore and other complex steel structures reporting unit that was lower than its carrying value. Lower near-term financial projections and an approximately 15% decline in the undiscounted terminal value applied in the 2018 annual impairment test, when compared to the 2017 annual impairment test, is a result of a challenging pricing environment for onshore wind and energy transmission structures that is difficult to predict when it will recover. As a result, a goodwill impairment was recorded in the third quarter of 2018 totaling $14.4 million, which represents all of the goodwill of the Offshore and other complex steel reporting unit. All of our other reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value, so no additional goodwill was impaired.\nIf our assumptions on discount rates and future cash flows change as a result of events or circumstances, and we believe these assets may have declined in value, then we may record impairment charges, resulting in lower profits. Our reporting units are all cyclical and their sales and profitability may fluctuate from year to year. The Company continues to monitor changes in the global economy that could impact future operating results of its reporting units. If such conditions arise, the Company will test a given reporting unit for impairment prior to the annual test. In the evaluation of our reporting units, we look at the long-term prospects for the reporting unit and recognize that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value, which requires management judgment.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names. We assess the values of these assets apart from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing. We use the relief-from-royalty method to evaluate our trade names, under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question. The royalty, which is based on a reasonable rate applied against estimated future sales, is tax-effected and discounted to present value. The most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales, the royalty rate and the after-tax discount rate. For our evaluation purposes, the royalty rates used vary between 0.5% and 1.5% of sales and the after-tax discount rate of 12.0% to 16.0%, which we estimate to be the after-tax cost of capital for such assets.\nOur trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2018 using the relief-from-royalty valuation methodology. We determined that the value of the Valmont SM trade name (offshore and other complex steel reporting unit) was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of $1.4 million. No other trade names were determined to be impaired.\nInventories\nWe use the last-in first-out (LIFO) method to determine the value of approximately 37% of our inventory. The remaining 63% of our inventory is valued on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis. In periods of rising costs to produce inventory, the LIFO method will result in lower profits than FIFO, because higher recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the FIFO method. Conversely, in periods of falling costs to produce inventory, the LIFO method will result in higher profits than the FIFO method.\nIn 2018, 2017, and 2016, we experienced higher average costs to produce inventory than in the prior year, due mainly to higher cost for steel and steel-related products. This resulted in higher costs of goods sold in 2018, 2017, and 2016 of approximately $9.9 million, $5.7 million, and $3.0 million, respectively, than if our entire inventory had been valued on the FIFO method.\nWe write down slow-moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses, the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory. If our ability to realize value on slow-moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed, additional inventory write downs may be required.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income expectations and tax-planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we estimate a deferred tax asset is not likely to be fully realized in the future, a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net earnings in the period the determination was made. Likewise, if we subsequently determine that we are able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made.\nAt December 29, 2018, we had approximately $56.9 million in deferred tax assets relating to tax credits and loss carryforwards, with a valuation allowance of $33.2 million, including $2.3 million in valuation allowances remaining in the Delta entities related to capital loss carryforwards, which are unlikely ever to be realized. If circumstances related to our deferred tax assets change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets, resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income.\nWe previously considered the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no related deferred income tax liabilities. The 2017 Tax Act, enacted in December 2017, subjected our unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $400 million to tax at certain specified rates. We made a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation of $9.9 million in 2017. Further, deferred taxes of $11.7 million related to these unremitted foreign earnings were recorded in 2017 for future taxes that will be incurred when cash is repatriated. In 2018, as a result of additional guidance we finalized the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our finalized unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $394 million concluding the transitional tax obligation was $9.3 million. In addition, we have taken the position that on non-U.S. subsidiaries we are not indefinitely reinvested on their 2018 unremitted foreign earnings. Therefore, we recorded income tax expense for foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes of $0.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively during 2018.\nWe are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the various countries in which we operate. The tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly consider the likelihood of additional income tax assessments in each of these taxing jurisdictions based on our experiences related to prior audits and our understanding of the facts and circumstances of the related tax issues. We include in current income tax expense any changes to accruals for potential tax deficiencies. If our judgments related to tax deficiencies differ from our actual experience, our income tax expense could increase or decrease in a given fiscal period.\nPension Benefits\nDelta Ltd. maintains a defined benefit pension plan for qualifying employees in the United Kingdom. There are no active employees as members in the plan. Independent actuaries assist in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with accounting for pension benefits to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses, we must make several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets.\nWe evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually. Key assumptions are based on the following factors:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount rate is based on the yields available on AA-rated corporate bonds with durational periods similar to that of the pension liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions. Most of the assets in the pension plan are invested in corporate bonds, the expected return of which are estimated based on the yield available on AA rated corporate bonds. The long-term expected returns on equities are based on historic performance over the long-term.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Inflation is based on the estimated change in the consumer price index ( CPI\u201d) or the retail price index ( RPI\u201d), depending on the relevant plan provisions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We modified the method used to estimate the interest cost components of the net periodic pension expense in 2017. The new method uses the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the present value of the benefit plan obligations to relevant projected cash outflows for the corresponding year. Prior to 2017, the interest cost components were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate. The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit plan obligation at year-end as the change in interest cost will be offset by an equivalent but opposite change in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation was 2.90% at December 29, 2018. The following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension expense for 2019 and the estimated impact on 2019 pension expense relative to a change in those assumptions:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions\n</td> <td>Pension\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>2.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>4.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflation - CPI\n</td> <td>2.20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflation - RPI\n</td> <td>3.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions In Millions of Dollars\n</td> <td>Increase\nin Pension\nExpense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.25% decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.25% decrease in expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.25% increase in inflation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective the first day of fiscal 2018, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Please see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new standard and the cumulative effect from the modified retrospective adjustment.\nWe determine the appropriate revenue recognition for our contracts by analyzing the type, terms and conditions of each contract or arrangement with a customer. We have no contracts with customers, under any product line, where we could\nearn variable consideration. With the exception of our Utility segment and the wireless communication structures product line, our inventory is interchangeable for a variety of the product line's customers. There is one performance obligation for revenue recognition. Our Irrigation and Coatings segments recognize revenue at a point in time, which is when the service has been performed or when the goods ship; this is the same time that the customer is billed. Lighting, traffic, highway safety, and access system product lines within the ESS segment recognize revenue and bill customers at a point in time, which is typically when the product ships or when it is delivered, as stipulated in the customer contract.\nThe following provides additional information about our contracts with utility and wireless communication structures customers, where the revenue is recognized over time, the judgments we make in accounting for those contracts, and the resulting amounts recognized in our financial statements.\nAccounting for utility structures and wireless communication monopole contracts: Steel and concrete utility and wireless communication monopole structures are engineered to customer specifications resulting in limited ability to sell the structure to a different customer if an order is canceled after production commences. The continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment for work performed to-date plus a reasonable profit as the products do not have an alternative use to us. Since control is transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We have certain wireless communication structures customers' contracts where we do not have the right to payment for work performed. In those instances, we recognize revenue at a point in time which is time of shipment of the structure.\nThe selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment. For our steel and concrete utility and wireless communication structure product lines, we recognize revenue on an inputs basis, using total production hours incurred to-date for each order as a percentage of total hours estimated to produce the order. The completion percentage is applied to the order's total revenue and total estimated costs to determine reported revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit. Our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system captures the total costs incurred to-date and the total production hours, both incurred to-date and forecast to complete. Revenue from the offshore and other complex steel structures business is also recognized using an inputs method, based on the cost-to-cost measure of progress. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation.\nManagement must make assumptions and estimates regarding manufacturing labor hours and wages, the usage and cost of materials, and manufacturing burden / overhead recovery rates for each production facility. For our steel, concrete and wireless communication structures, production of an order, once started, is typically completed within three months. Projected profitability on open production orders is reviewed and updated monthly. We elected the practical expedient to not disclose the partially satisfied performance obligation at the end of the period when the contract has an original expected duration of one year or less.\nWe also have a few steel structure customer orders in a fiscal year that require one or two years to complete, due to the quantity of structures. Burden rates and routed production hours, per structure, will be adjusted if and when actual costs incurred are significantly higher than what had been originally projected. This resets the timing of revenue recognition for future periods so it is better aligned with the new production schedule. For our offshore and other complex steel structures, we update the estimates of total costs to complete each order quarterly. Based on these updates, revenue in the current period may reflect adjustments for amounts that had been previously recognized. During fiscal 2018, there were no changes to inputs/estimates which resulted in adjustments to revenue for production that occurred prior to the beginning of the quarter. A provision for loss on the performance obligation is recognized if and when an order is projected to be at a loss, whether or not production has started.", "item_7_truncated": "The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment.

We assess the value of our reporting units using after-tax cash flows from operations (less capital expenses) discounted to present value and as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the discount rate and the projected cash flows. We also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units.\n\u2022acquisitions; and\nSteel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate, and zinc in the U.S. increased at a higher rate in 2018, as compared to 2017, resulting in higher LIFO expense.\n \u2022 a modification of the definition of \"EBITDA\" to add-back non-recurring cash and non-cash restructuring costs in an amount that does not exceed $75 million in any trailing twelve month period; \nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>ESS\n</td> <td>Utility\n</td> <td>Coatings\n</td> <td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,746.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>912.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>856.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>256.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>644.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>(100.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pricing/mix\n</td> <td>114.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition/(divestiture)\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency translation\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales - 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,757.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>967.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>855.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company divested of its grinding media business in the second quarter of 2018, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of approximately $6.1 million.

Lower near-term financial projections and an approximately 15% decline in the undiscounted terminal value applied in the 2018 annual impairment test, when compared to the 2017 annual impairment test, is a result of a challenging pricing environment for onshore wind and energy transmission structures that is difficult to predict when it will recover. As a result, a goodwill impairment was recorded in the third quarter of 2018 totaling $14.4 million, which represents all of the goodwill of the Offshore and other complex steel reporting unit.

The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows:\nOur effective income tax rate in 2017 and 2016 was 46.5% and 19.1%, respectively. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\" or Act\u201d) includes a number of changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that impact corporations beginning in 2018; including a reduction in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limiting or eliminating certain tax deductions, and changing the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings. Accordingly, the Company recorded a one-time charge of approximately $42 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the transition effects of the Act. Excluding this charge, our effective tax rate would have been 28.1% for 2017. The $42 million charge is comprised of (a) approximately $9.9 million of expense related to the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings, the federal portion of which is payable over eight (8) years beginning in 2018, (b) approximately $20.4 million of expense related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax balances to reflect the new U.S. corporate income tax rate, using a federal and state tax rate of 25.0%, and (c) approximately $11.7 million of deferred expenses related to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. These amounts are provisional and our estimates and overall impact of the Act may change for various reasons including, but not limited to, changes in our interpretation and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by governing authorities, and tax planning actions we may undertake. We continue to gather additional information to fully account for the Act. Any updates and changes in the estimates will be communicated in future quarterly financial statements.\nThe increase in sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, was due to improved roadway product sales volumes and communication product line sales volumes. Global lighting and traffic, and roadway product sales in 2017 were higher compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased sales volumes in roadway product sales, which is a product line outside of North America. In 2017, as compared to 2016, sales volumes in the U.S. were lower across commercial and transportation markets. The 2015 long-term U.S. highway bill has not yet provided a meaningful uplift for our North America structures business. Sales in Europe were lower in 2017 as the domestic markets in general remain subdued. The increase in sales for global lighting and traffic, and roadway product is also attributed to currency translation effects and the acquisition of Aircon in the third quarter of 2017.\nIn 2018, 2017, and 2016, we experienced higher average costs to produce inventory than in the prior year, due mainly to higher cost for steel and steel-related products. This resulted in higher costs of goods sold in 2018, 2017, and 2016 of approximately $9.9 million, $5.7 million, and $3.0 million, respectively, than if our entire inventory had been valued on the FIFO method.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales decreased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to restructuring costs incurred of $4.1 million and lower offshore and complex steel structures sales volumes. SG&A expense was higher in 2018, as compared with 2017, due to the goodwill and trade name impairment recorded for Offshore business of $15.8 million, restructuring expenses, and increased expenses related to the acquisition of Derit and Convert. Excluding restructuring expenses, expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the intangible asset impairment, operating income in 2018 was consistent with 2017.\n \u2022 currency translation effects of $1.9 million (higher SG&A) due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and South African rand against the U.S. dollar. \n \u2022 the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points, and \nGeneral\nUnconditional purchase commitments relate to purchase orders for zinc, aluminum and steel, all of which we plan to use in 2019, and certain capital investments planned for 2019. We believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period. The unconditional purchase commitments also includes the January 2019 purchase of the non-controlling interests of Walpar, LLC for $23.1 million as contractually required per the purchase agreement.\nRevenue Recognition\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome Tax Expense\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAt December 30, 2017, the Company had open foreign currency forward contracts that qualified as net investment hedges. The purpose of the net investment hedges were to mitigate foreign currency risk on a portion of our foreign subsidiary investments in the grinding media business that are denominated in British pounds and Australian dollars. The divestiture of our grinding media business was pending at the end of 2017 and was finalized in the second quarter of 2018. The forward contracts had a maturity date in the first quarter of 2018 and a notional amount to sell British pounds and Australian dollars and receive $24.1 million and $21.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts, the most significant of which was a one-year foreign currency forward contract which qualified as a net investment hedge, in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on a portion of our foreign subsidiary investments denominated in British pounds. The notional amount of this forward contract to sell British pounds was $44.0 million and the contract was settled in May 2017. Much of our cash in non-U.S. entities is denominated in foreign currencies, where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in U.S. dollar terms. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately $18.5 million in 2018 and $37.2 million in 2017.\nacquisitions totaling $143.0 million ($5.4 million in 2017) that was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the grinding media business of $62.5 million. We expect our capital spending for the 2019 fiscal year to be approximately $90.0 million.\nWe also announced our intention to manage our capital structure to maintain our investment grade debt rating. Our most recent ratings were Baa3 by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and BBB+ by Standard and Poor's Rating Services. We would be willing to allow our debt rating to fall to BBB- to finance a special acquisition or other opportunity. We expect to maintain a ratio of debt to invested capital which will support our current investment grade debt rating.\nThe approximate $14.8 million in pre-tax costs ($11.1 million after-tax) associated with refinancing of debt is due to the Company's repurchase through tender of $250.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes due 2020. This expense was comprised of the following:\nAverage steel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate were higher in North America and China in 2017, as compared to 2016, resulting in higher average cost of material. We expect that average selling prices will increase over time to offset the decrease in gross profit realized from the higher cost of steel for the Company. The Company acquired a highway business in India (\"Aircon\") in the third quarter of 2017 that is included in the ESS segment.\n \u2022 CSP Coating Systems (\"CSP Coatings\"), a coatings provider in New Zealand, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2018 that is included in the Coatings segment. \nThe decrease in other income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily due to the reversal of a contingent liability provision of approximately $16.6 million in 2016, out of \"Other noncurrent liabilities.\"\n\nAt a consolidated level, the reduction in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2017, as compared with 2016, was primarily due to higher cost of raw materials across most of our businesses. The Utility segment realized an increase in gross margin in 2017, while ESS, Irrigation, and Coatings realized a decrease in gross profit primarily due to sales pricing that did not fully recover higher raw material costs and unfavorable sales mix. Lower volumes for Coatings and Other also contributed to the reduction in gross margin through deleverage of fixed costs.\n \u2022 Cash prepayment expenses of approximately $15.8 million; plus \n \u2022 We are allowed to repurchase the notes subject to the payment of a make-whole premium. Both tranches of these notes are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries.  On October 18, 2017, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The credit facility provides for $600 million of committed unsecured revolving credit loans. We may increase the credit facility by up to an additional $200 million at any time, subject to lenders increasing the amount of their commitments. The Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries Valmont Industries Holland B.V. and Valmont Group Pty. Ltd., are authorized borrowers under the credit facility. The obligations arising under\nAs a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we reassessed our position with respect to the approximately $400 million of unremitted foreign earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our position is that the previously deferred earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries that were subject to the Transition Tax are not indefinitely reinvested. Further, in 2018 we have taken the position on non-U.S. subsidiaries we are not indefinitely reinvested on their 2018 unremitted foreign earnings. Of our cash balances of $313.2 million at December 29, 2018, approximately $203.6 million is held in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Consequently, with the change in our position on unremitted foreign earnings, if we distributed our foreign cash balances certain taxes would be applicable. At December 29, 2018, we have a liability for foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes of $3.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\nIf our assumptions on discount rates and future cash flows change as a result of events or circumstances, and we believe these assets may have declined in value, then we may record impairment charges, resulting in lower profits. Our reporting units are all cyclical and their sales and profitability may fluctuate from year to year. The Company continues to monitor changes in the global economy that could impact future operating results of its reporting units. If such conditions arise, the Company will test a given reporting unit for impairment prior to the annual test. In the evaluation of our reporting units, we look at the long-term prospects for the reporting unit and recognize that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value, which requires management judgment.\nIn April 2018, the Company completed the sale of Donhad, a mining consumable business with operations in Australia. The Company realized an approximate $6.1 million loss on the sale that is recorded in other income/expense, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\nEngineered Support Structures (ESS) segment\nEffective the first day of fiscal 2018, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Please see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new standard and the cumulative effect from the modified retrospective adjustment.\nWe have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment. These leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts. We also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts.\nIn the Utility segment, sales increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to improved volumes and higher sales prices due to steel cost increases and a favorable sales mix. A number of our sales contracts contain provisions that tie the sales price to published steel index pricing at the time our customer issues their purchase order. Improved sales demand in North America resulted in increased sales volumes in tons for both steel and concrete utility structures that also contributed to the increase in sales. International utility structures sales decreased in 2017 due to lower volumes.\nAccess Systems product line net sales decreased in 2018 by $2.7 million, as compared to 2017. The decrease can be attributed to lower sales volumes in Asia due to less large project work that was partially offset by improved demand in Australia, in part due to efforts to expand our sales reach into architectural and construction markets.\n \u2022 Walpar, a manufacturer of overhead sign structures, in the third quarter of 2018 that is included in the ESS segment. \nCoatings segment sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased sales prices to recover higher zinc costs globally. External sales volumes decreased while intercompany volumes increased in North America during 2017. In the Asia-Pacific region, improved demand/volume in Australia along with currency transaction effects led to an increase in sales in 2017 as compared to 2016.\n \u2022 higher deferred compensation expenses of $2.7 million, which was offset by a decrease of the same amount of other expense; and \n \u2022 Discount rate is based on the yields available on AA-rated corporate bonds with durational periods similar to that of the pension liabilities. \nUtility Support Structures (Utility) segment\nCorporate SG&A expense was lower in 2018 as compared to 2017. The decrease can be attributed to lower deferred compensation expenses of $5.0 million, which is offset by the same amount in other expense, and lower incentive expense. The decrease was partially offset by higher compensation expenses.\nPension Benefits\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names. We assess the values of these assets apart from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing. We use the relief-from-royalty method to evaluate our trade names, under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question. The royalty, which is based on a reasonable rate applied against estimated future sales, is tax-effected and discounted to present value. The most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales, the royalty rate and the after-tax discount rate. For our evaluation purposes, the royalty rates used vary between 0.5% and 1.5% of sales and the after-tax discount rate of 12.0% to 16.0%, which we estimate to be the after-tax cost of capital for such assets.\nFINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS\nWe manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities or by utilizing hedging instruments (as discussed above) where appropriate. The following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our most significant investments at year-end assuming a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.\nOther\nAt a consolidated level, the reduction in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2018, as compared with 2017, was primarily due to restructuring costs incurred in the ESS and Utility segments. The Irrigation and Coatings segments realized an increase in gross margin in 2018, while Utility, ESS, and Other realized a decrease in gross margin.\nAccounting for utility structures and wireless communication monopole contracts: Steel and concrete utility and wireless communication monopole structures are engineered to customer specifications resulting in limited ability to sell the structure to a different customer if an order is canceled after production commences. The continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment for work performed to-date plus a reasonable profit as the products do not have an alternative use to us. Since control is transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We have certain wireless communication structures customers' contracts where we do not have the right to payment for work performed. In those instances, we recognize revenue at a point in time which is time of shipment of the structure.\nThe following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements. We must make estimates on a number of items, such as impairments of long-lived assets, income taxes, revenue recognition for the product lines recognized over time, inventory obsolescence, and pension benefits. We base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Further, we re-evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change. Actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions. The selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed annually with our audit committee.\n \u2022 Derit Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (\"Derit\"), a manufacturing facility located in India that is included in both the Utility and Coatings segments. \nthe credit facility are guaranteed by the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries PiRod, Inc., Valmont Coatings, Inc., Valmont Newmark, Inc. and Valmont Queensland Pty. Ltd.\nCoatings segment sales increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to increased sales prices to recover higher zinc costs globally and higher sales volumes. The Company acquired Derit in the third quarter of 2018 and CSP Coatings in the fourth quarter of 2018 that also contributed to higher sales. Sales pricing and volume demand increased in North America in 2018, as compared to 2017. In the Asia-Pacific region, continued improvements in the Australia market along with overall higher sales pricing provided an increase in net sales.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nDelta Ltd. maintains a defined benefit pension plan for qualifying employees in the United Kingdom. There are no active employees as members in the plan. Independent actuaries assist in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with accounting for pension benefits to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses, we must make several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe have historically funded our growth, capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing. In May 2014, our Board of Directors approved and publicly announced a capital allocation philosophy with the following priorities for cash generated:\nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes.\n\nOn a consolidated basis, the increase in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, reflected higher sales in all reportable segments. The changes in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, were as follows: \nOperating income was lower for all reportable segments with the exception of Coatings in 2018, as compared to 2017. The decrease is attributed to the impairment of the goodwill and trade name of the Offshore business, restructuring costs incurred in the ESS and Utility segments, and the disposal of the grinding media business included in Other.\nFISCAL 2017 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2016\nWe previously considered the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no related deferred income taxes. Prior to the 2017 Tax Act, we had an excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, including unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $400 million. While the tax on these foreign earnings imposed by the 2017 Tax Act ( Transition Tax\u201d) resulted in the reduction of the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, an actual repatriation from our non-U.S. subsidiaries may still be subject to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes.\nThe Company saw an increase within SG&A expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to the following:\nNet interest expense for 2018 was consistent with 2017. The Company issued $200.0 million and $55.0 million of senior secured notes in June 2018 at 5.0% and 5.25%, respectively. Proceeds from the debt issuance were subsequently used to pay off the 2020 bonds in July 2018.\nCommunication product line sales were lower by $21.9 million in 2018, as compared with 2017. In North America, communication structure and component sales increased in 2018 due to strong demand from the network expansion by providers. In Asia-Pacific, sales volumes decreased due to much lower demand in China for new wireless communication structures.\nCapital Allocation Philosophy\n \u2022 $305 million face value ($297.4 million carrying value) of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 5.25% per annum and are due in October 2054. \n\u2022working capital and capital expenditure investments necessary for future sales growth;\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nTax expense in 2016 included $30.6 million of deferred income tax benefit attributable to the remeasurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Company's U.K. defined benefit pension plan. In addition, we recorded a $9.9 million valuation allowance against a tax credit for which we believe we are not likely to receive the benefit in 2016. Excluding these items as well as the impact of the reversal of the contingent liability of $16.6 million that is not taxable, our adjusted effective tax rate was 30.8% for 2016 versus the GAAP reported effective tax rate of 19.1%.\nNet corporate expense is similar when comparing 2017 to 2016. Approximately $4 million of increased incentive expense was offset by lower pension expense and better performance of the Company's U.S. medical plan as compared to 2016.\n\u2022dividends on common stock in the range of 15% of the prior year's fully diluted net earnings;\n\nIn 2017, as compared to 2016, operating income for all operating segments were higher except for the ESS segment and Other. The increase in operating income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily attributable to increased sales volumes in the Utility and Irrigation segments, along with restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 and the associated benefits of the restructuring activities.\nUtility Support Structures (Utility) segment\n (a) LIBOR (based on a 1, 2, 3 or 6 month interest period, as selected by us) plus 100 to 162.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; or  (b) the higher of\nInvesting Cash Flows-Capital spending in fiscal 2018 was $72.0 million, as compared with $55.3 million in fiscal 2017 and $57.9 million in fiscal 2016. Capital spending projects in 2018 included investments in machinery and equipment across all businesses. The increase in investing cash outflows in 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to business\n\n\nOur effective income tax rate in 2018 and 2017 was 30.1% and 46.5%, respectively. The 2018 tax rate was impacted by the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% offset by 2018 restructuring costs and impairment charges for which no tax benefits have been recorded. The 2017 tax rate was impacted by The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\" or Act\u201d) which resulted in a one-time fourth quarter of 2017 charge of approximately $42 million related to the transition effects of the Act. Excluding this charge, our effective tax rate would have been 28.1% for 2017.\n\n \u2022 the prime lending rate, \nOther Income/Expense\nOffshore and other complex structures sales decreased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes that were partially offset by favorable currency translation effects.\nAt December 29, 2018, we had approximately $56.9 million in deferred tax assets relating to tax credits and loss carryforwards, with a valuation allowance of $33.2 million, including $2.3 million in valuation allowances remaining in the Delta entities related to capital loss carryforwards, which are unlikely ever to be realized. If circumstances related to our deferred tax assets change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets, resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income.\nOur businesses are cyclical, but we have diversity in our markets, from a product, customer and a geographical standpoint. We have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage through business cycles and maintain liquidity. We have consistently generated operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures. Based on our available credit facilities, recent issuance of senior unsecured notes and our history of positive operational cash flows, we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs for fiscal 2019 and beyond.\nAt December 29, 2018, we had $5.7 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility has a maturity date of October 18, 2022 and contains certain financial covenants that may limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement. At December 29, 2018, we had the ability to borrow $579.7 million under this facility, after consideration of standby letters of credit of $14.6 million associated with certain insurance obligations. We also maintain certain short-term bank lines of credit totaling $137.7 million; $127.0 million of which was unused at December 29, 2018.\n\nGross profit, as a percentage of sales, and operating income for the segment were lower in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to restructuring costs incurred in 2018. In 2018, the segment incurred $14.3 million of restructuring costs within product cost of sales and $14.2 million within SG&A expense. In addition, approximately $8.0 million of asset impairment costs were incurred related to exiting certain local markets in 2018. SG&A spending was higher in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to restructuring costs and SG&A expenses of Walpar that was acquired in the third quarter of 2018. Operating income decreased primarily from the the $28.5 million of incurred restructuring costs.\nOverview\nCurrency Translation\nOur debt financing at December 29, 2018 consisted primarily of long-term debt. During 2018, the Company issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% senior notes due 2044 and $55 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% senior notes due 2054 and redeemed $250.2 million in remaining aggregate principal amount of the 2020 senior notes. Our long-term debt as of December 29, 2018, principally consists of:\nRisk Management\nIrrigation segment\nIn 2016, we executed a restructuring plan in Australia/New Zealand focused primarily on closing and consolidating locations within the ESS and Coatings segments (the \"2016 Plan\"). We incurred $7.8 million of restructuring expense consisting of $5.0 million in cost of goods sold and $2.8 million in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2016. The Plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2016.\n \u2022 Recognition of $2.0 million of the unamortized premium originally recorded upon the issuance of the 2020 notes. \nOur trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2018 using the relief-from-royalty valuation methodology. We determined that the value of the Valmont SM trade name (offshore and other complex steel reporting unit) was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of $1.4 million. No other trade names were determined to be impaired.\nCash Flows from Operations\nWe determine the appropriate revenue recognition for our contracts by analyzing the type, terms and conditions of each contract or arrangement with a customer. We have no contracts with customers, under any product line, where we could\nIn 2015, we executed a broad restructuring plan (the \"2015 Plan\") to respond to the market environment in certain of our businesses. During 2016, we incurred approximately $4.6 million of restructuring expense to complete the 2015 Plan consisting of $4.1 million in SG&A expense with the remainder recorded in cost of goods sold.\nSources of Financing\nChanges in Prices\n \u2022 Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions. Most of the assets in the pension plan are invested in corporate bonds, the expected return of which are estimated based on the yield available on AA rated corporate bonds. The long-term expected returns on equities are based on historic performance over the long-term. \n \u2022 restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 totaling $6.8 million; and \n \u2022 Leverage ratio - Interest-bearing debt is not to exceed 3.50x Adjusted EBITDA (or 3.75x Adjusted EBITDA after certain material acquisitions) of the prior four quarters; and \nNatural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories, especially in our Coatings segment galvanizing operations, where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot-dipped galvanizing process. Natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments. Our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for 0-50% of our U.S. natural gas requirements for the upcoming 6-12 months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on NYMEX futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged. The objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden, significant increases in the price of natural gas. At December 29, 2018, we have no natural gas swaps outstanding.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved pricing and sales mix and higher sales volumes in North America and improved factory performance for the offshore and other complex structures business. SG&A expense was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to higher incentive expense due to improved operations and commission expense attributed to the increased sales volumes. Operating income increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to the increased sales volumes and improved pricing and sales mix in North America.\nCoatings segment\nNet corporate expense\n \u2022 A majority ownership stake in Convert Italia SpA (\"Convert\"), a provider of engineered solar tracker solutions, also acquired during the third quarter of 2018 and included in the Utility segment. \nIn February 2018, the Company announced a restructuring plan related to certain operations in 2018, primarily in the ESS segment, through consolidation and other cost-reduction activities (the \"2018 Plan\"). The Company incurred pre-tax expenses from the 2018 Plan of $34.0 million. The decrease in 2018 gross profit and operating income due to restructuring expense by segment is as follows:\nThe Board of Directors in May 2014 authorized the purchase of up to $500 million of the Company's outstanding common stock from time to time over twelve months at prevailing market prices, through open market or privately-negotiated transactions. The Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million of share purchases, without an expiration date in both February 2015 and again in October 2018. The purchases will be funded from available working capital and short-term borrowings and will be made subject to market and economic conditions. We are not obligated to make any repurchases and may discontinue the program at any time. As of December 29, 2018, we have acquired approximately 5.4 million shares for approximately $732.6 million under these share repurchase programs.\nAt December 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements. The key covenant calculations at December 29, 2018 were as follows (amounts in thousands):\ntime, as market conditions indicate, we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with anticipated future transactions, current balance sheet positions, and foreign subsidiary investments that are in currencies other than the functional currencies of our businesses. At December 29, 2018, the Company had two oustanding foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate foreign currency risk of the Company's investment in its Australian dollar and Euro denominated businesses. The forward contracts, which qualify as net investment hedges, have a maturity date of May 2020 and notional amounts to sell Australian dollars and Euro to receive $100.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively. On August 24, 2018, the Company entered into three fixed-for-fixed cross currency swaps ( CCS\u201d), swapping U.S. dollar principal and interest payments on a portion of its 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2044 for Danish krone (DKK) and Euro denominated payments. The CCS were entered into in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on the Company's Euro and DKK investments and to reduce interest expense. The notional of the two Euro and DKK CCS are $35.0 million and $60.0 million, respectively, and they mature in 2020 to 2023.\nThe material amendments to the credit facility, which are set forth in the amended and restated credit agreement, include:an extension of the maturity date of the credit facility from October 17, 2019 to October 18, 2022;\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was higher in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved earnings for our majority-owned irrigation businesses.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial position. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\nThe change in other income/expense in 2018, as compared with 2017, was primarily due to the divestiture of our grinding media business that resulted in a loss of approximately $6.1 million. Excluding the divestiture, higher other income was driven by a periodic pension benefit in 2018 that resulted a beneficial change of $2.8 million. In addition, the change in market value of the Company's shares held of Delta EMD was an improvement of $0.8 million. The remaining change was due to more favorable foreign currency transaction gains/losses in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in other income was partially offset by a change in valuation of deferred compensation assets in 2018 which resulted in additional expense of $5.0 million. This amount is offset by a reduction of the same amount in SG&A expense.\nCommodity risk- Steel hot rolled coil is a significant commodity input used by all of our segments in the manufacture of our products, with the exception of Coatings. Steel prices are volatile and we may utilize derivative instruments to mitigate commodity price risk on fixed price orders. In 2018, the Company entered into steel hot rolled coil forward contracts which qualified as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash flows attributable to future steel purchases. The forward contracts had a notional amount of $8,469 for the purchase of 3,500 short tons for each month from July 2018 to September 2018 and a notional amount of $15,563 for the purchase of 6,500 short tons for each month from October 2018 to December 2018.\nLong-term debt mainly consisted of $755.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes. At December 29, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $5.7 million under our bank revolving credit agreement. Obligations under these agreements may be accelerated in event of non-compliance with debt covenants. The Delta pension plan contributions are\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our management and reporting structure changed to reflect management's expectations of future growth of certain product lines and to take into consideration the expected divestiture of the grinding media business, which historically was reported in the Energy and Mining segment. The access systems applications product line is now part of the Engineered Support Structures (\"ESS\") segment and the offshore and other complex structures product line is now part of the Utility segment. Grinding media will be reported in \"Other\" pending the completion of its divestiture. In the first quarter of 2017, we also changed our reportable segment operating income to separate out the LIFO expense (benefit). Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO method in the consolidated financial statements. Our segment discussions and segment financial information have been accordingly reclassified in this report to reflect this change, for all periods presented.\nThe Company acquired the following companies during 2018:\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nWe also have a few steel structure customer orders in a fiscal year that require one or two years to complete, due to the quantity of structures. Burden rates and routed production hours, per structure, will be adjusted if and when actual costs incurred are significantly higher than what had been originally projected. This resets the timing of revenue recognition for future periods so it is better aligned with the new production schedule. For our offshore and other complex steel structures, we update the estimates of total costs to complete each order quarterly. Based on these updates, revenue in the current period may reflect adjustments for amounts that had been previously recognized. During fiscal 2018, there were no changes to inputs/estimates which resulted in adjustments to revenue for production that occurred prior to the beginning of the quarter. A provision for loss on the performance obligation is recognized if and when an order is projected to be at a loss, whether or not production has started.\nThe discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation was 2.90% at December 29, 2018. The following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension expense for 2019 and the estimated impact on 2019 pension expense relative to a change in those assumptions:\nIncome Taxes\nSG&A was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. The increase can be attributed to higher incentive and commission costs due to improved business results, increased product development and promotional expenses, and currency translation effects related to the international irrigation business. Gross profit and operating income for the segment increased in 2017 over 2016, primarily due to North America and international irrigation sales volume increases and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nThe above increases were partially offset by the following decreases in SG&A expense in 2017 as compared to 2016:\n \u2022 reversal of $3.2 million of a contingent consideration liability in 2016 to the former owners of an acquired business; \nThe increase in Irrigation segment net sales in 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to sales volume increases for both domestic and international irrigation and currency translation effects. In North America, when comparing 2017 to 2016, sales volumes increased driven by markets outside the traditional corn-belt. In addition, higher equipment running times due to weather conditions resulted in higher service parts sales. International sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to volume increases in the Middle East and South America and favorable foreign currency translation effects for Brazil and South Africa.\n \u2022 Torrent Engineering and Equipment (\"Torrent\") in the first quarter of 2018 that is included in our Irrigation segment. \nAccess systems product line net sales in 2017 were higher than in 2016, due to higher average sales prices and favorable currency translation effects.\n\nFinancing Cash Flows-Our total interest-bearing debt decreased to $753.3 million at December 29, 2018, from $755.0 million at December 30, 2017. During 2018 and 2016, we acquired approximately 0.8 million shares and 0.4 million shares for $114.8 million and $53.8 million, respectively, under the share repurchase program. No shares were repurchased in 2017.\nLIFO expense\nIn 2017, we realized a benefit to operating profit, as compared with fiscal 2016, due to currency translation effects. The U.S. dollar primarily weakened against the Brazilian real and South African rand, resulting in more operating profit in U.S. dollar terms. The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows:\nA commitment fee is also required under the revolving credit facility which accrues at 10 to 25 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard and Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investor Services, Inc., on the average daily unused portion of the commitment under the revolving credit facility.\nWe are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the various countries in which we operate. The tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly consider the likelihood of additional income tax assessments in each of these taxing jurisdictions based on our experiences related to prior audits and our understanding of the facts and circumstances of the related tax issues. We include in current income tax expense any changes to accruals for potential tax deficiencies. If our judgments related to tax deficiencies differ from our actual experience, our income tax expense could increase or decrease in a given fiscal period.\nCurrency Translation\nWe have future financial obligations related to (1) payment of principal and interest on interest-bearing debt, (2) Delta pension plan contributions, (3) operating leases and (4) purchase obligations. These obligations at December 29, 2018 were as follows (in millions of dollars):\nInterest Rates-Our interest-bearing debt at December 29, 2018 was mostly fixed rate debt. Our notes payable and a small portion of our long-term debt accrue interest at a variable rate. Assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would have affected our interest expense in 2018 and 2017 by approximately $0.1 million. Likewise, we have excess cash balances on deposit in interest-bearing accounts in financial institutions. An increase or decrease in interest rates of ten basis points would have impacted our annual interest earnings in 2018 and 2017 by approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\n \u2022 Recognition of $1.0 million of expense comprised of the write-offs of unamortized loss on the cash flow hedge and deferred financing costs; less \nThese debt agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities, including capital expenditures. These debt agreements allow us to add estimated EBITDA from acquired businesses for periods we did not own the acquired businesses. The debt agreements also provide for an adjustment to EBITDA, subject to certain specified limitations, for non-cash charges or gains that are non-recurring in nature.\nWorking Capital and Operating Cash Flows-Net working capital was $931.6 million at December 29, 2018, as compared with $1,069.6 million at December 30, 2017. The decrease in net working capital in 2018 mainly resulted from lower cash balances mostly attributed to the investing outflow for acquisitions and financing outflow for stock repurchases, and an increase in accrued expense for the Convert contingent consideration liability. Operating cash flow was $153.0 million in 2018, as compared with $133.1 million in 2017 and $232.8 million in 2016. The increase in operating cash flow in 2018, as compared to 2017, was due to lower contributions to the Delta Pension Plan in 2018 partially offset by lower net earnings.\nIn the Utility segment, sales decreased in 2018, as compared with 2017, due to lower sales volumes in North America that are offset by sales price increases to cover higher steel costs and the acquisition of Convert and Derit in the\nCoatings segment\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions. We have assigned useful lives to our property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from 3 to 40 years. Impairment losses were recorded in 2018 as facilities were closed and certain fixed assets are no longer expected to be used as a result of our restructuring plans.\nOther Income/Expense\nCertain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price. The most significant materials are steel, aluminum, zinc and natural gas. Over the last several years, prices for these commodities have been volatile. The volatility in these prices was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply and demand conditions, government tariffs and the costs of steel-making inputs. Steel is most significant for our utility support structures segment where the cost of steel has been approximately 50% of the net sales, on average. In 2018, we began using steel hot rolled coil derivative contracts on a limited basis to mitigate the impact of rising steel prices on operating income. Assuming a similar sales mix, a hypothetical 20% change in the price of steel would have affected our net sales from our utility support structures segment by approximately $64 million for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nWe previously considered the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no related deferred income tax liabilities. The 2017 Tax Act, enacted in December 2017, subjected our unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $400 million to tax at certain specified rates. We made a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation of $9.9 million in 2017. Further, deferred taxes of $11.7 million related to these unremitted foreign earnings were recorded in 2017 for future taxes that will be incurred when cash is repatriated. In 2018, as a result of additional guidance we finalized the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our finalized unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $394 million concluding the transitional tax obligation was $9.3 million. In addition, we have taken the position that on non-U.S. subsidiaries we are not indefinitely reinvested on their 2018 unremitted foreign earnings. Therefore, we recorded income tax expense for foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes of $0.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively during 2018.\nNet corporate expense\nGrinding media sales decreased from lower volumes. A decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by higher sales pricing and favorable currency translation effects. Gross profit and operating income were lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes.\nearn variable consideration. With the exception of our Utility segment and the wireless communication structures product line, our inventory is interchangeable for a variety of the product line's customers. There is one performance obligation for revenue recognition. Our Irrigation and Coatings segments recognize revenue at a point in time, which is when the service has been performed or when the goods ship; this is the same time that the customer is billed. Lighting, traffic, highway safety, and access system product lines within the ESS segment recognize revenue and bill customers at a point in time, which is typically when the product ships or when it is delivered, as stipulated in the customer contract.\nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nThe Company saw an increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to impairment of the goodwill and trade name of the Offshore and other complex structures (\"Offshore\") business totaling $15.8 million, restructuring costs incurred of $15.6 million, SG&A from recently acquired businesses of $9.0 million, and acquisition diligence expenses of $4.4 million. The increase was partially offset by lower deferred compensation expenses of $5.0 million (offset recognized in other expense as described below) and $3.6 million of SG&A in 2017 from the grinding media business divested in 2018.\n \u2022 Inflation is based on the estimated change in the consumer price index ( CPI\u201d) or the retail price index ( RPI\u201d), depending on the relevant plan provisions.  We modified the method used to estimate the interest cost components of the net periodic pension expense in 2017. The new method uses the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the present value of the benefit plan obligations to relevant projected cash outflows for the corresponding year. Prior to 2017, the interest cost components were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate. The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit plan obligation at year-end as the change in interest cost will be offset by an equivalent but opposite change in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).\n \u2022 Interest earned ratio - Adjusted EBITDA over the prior four quarters must be at least 2.50x our interest expense over the same period. \nWe write down slow-moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses, the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory. If our ability to realize value on slow-moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed, additional inventory write downs may be required.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nCommunication product line sales were higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. In North America and Asia-Pacific, communication structure and component sales increased due to higher demand from the continued network expansion by providers.\n \u2022 reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million related to land of a former galvanizing operation in Australia that was sold in 2017. \nOffshore and other complex structures sales decreased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to lower sales volumes that were partially offset by positive effects from currency translation.\nManagement's discussion and analysis, and other sections of this annual report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that management has made in light of experience in the industries in which the Company operates, as well as management's perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions. Many factors could affect the Company's actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things, risk factors described from time to time in the Company's reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as future economic and market circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results, operating efficiencies, availability and price of raw materials, availability and market acceptance of new products, product pricing, domestic and international competitive environments, and actions and policy changes of domestic and foreign governments.\nOverview\nManagement must make assumptions and estimates regarding manufacturing labor hours and wages, the usage and cost of materials, and manufacturing burden / overhead recovery rates for each production facility. For our steel, concrete and wireless communication structures, production of an order, once started, is typically completed within three months. Projected profitability on open production orders is reviewed and updated monthly. We elected the practical expedient to not disclose the partially satisfied performance obligation at the end of the period when the contract has an original expected duration of one year or less.\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income expectations and tax-planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we estimate a deferred tax asset is not likely to be fully realized in the future, a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net earnings in the period the determination was made. Likewise, if we subsequently determine that we are able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made.\nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nOur cash flows provided by operations was $133.1 million in 2017, as compared with $232.8 million provided by operations in 2016. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to less favorable working capital changes driven by higher receivables and inventory and higher contributions to the Delta Pension Plan in 2017.\nSG&A was lower in 2018, as compared to 2017. The decrease can be attributed to lower incentives from reduced business operations and currency translation effects which were partially offset by expenses associated with the 2018 acquisitions. Operating income for the segment decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, due to lower sales volumes and the associated operating deleverage of fixed costs and currency translation effects.\n \u2022 a modification of the leverage ratio permitting it to increase from 3.5X to 3.75X for the four consecutive fiscal quarters after certain material acquisitions; and \n \u2022 higher employee incentives of $5.0 million due to improved business operations; \nWe use the last-in first-out (LIFO) method to determine the value of approximately 37% of our inventory. The remaining 63% of our inventory is valued on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis. In periods of rising costs to produce inventory, the LIFO method will result in lower profits than FIFO, because higher recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the FIFO method. Conversely, in periods of falling costs to produce inventory, the LIFO method will result in higher profits than the FIFO method.\nFISCAL 2018 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017\nSG&A expense was lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower compensation costs and no restructuring expense in 2017. Both 2017 and 2016 had non-recurring transactions recognized as reductions in SG&A. A former galvanizing operation in Australia was sold in 2017 allowing for a reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million. In 2016, a contingent consideration liability to the former owners of an acquired business was reduced $3.2 million due to changes in estimated earnings over the earn-out period. Operating income was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to lower SG&A expenses.\nGlobal lighting and traffic, and highway safety product sales in 2018 were $73.4 million higher as compared to 2017, due to higher sales pricing and increased sales volumes. Sales volumes and pricing in North America were higher across commercial and transportation markets and also increased due to the acquisition of Walpar in the third quarter of 2018. Improved sales volumes in Europe contributed to higher sales in 2018, as compared to 2017, along with favorable currency translation effects as the value of the euro appreciated against the U.S. dollar. Sales volumes in Asia-Pacific were higher in India due to improved demand, offset by lower demand in China for lighting and traffic products. Highway safety product sales increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to higher demand in Australia and the acquisition of Aircon in the third quarter of 2017.\nCash Flows from Operations\nThe following provides additional information about our contracts with utility and wireless communication structures customers, where the revenue is recognized over time, the judgments we make in accounting for those contracts, and the resulting amounts recognized in our financial statements.\nWe have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years. Our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to reduce the volatility in our purchase prices and sales price increases where possible. We use natural gas swap contracts on a limited basis to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income.\nrelated to the current cash funding commitments to the plan with the plan's trustees. Operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe calculation of Adjusted EBITDA-last four quarters is presented under the column for fiscal 2018 in footnote (b) to the table \"Selected Five-Year Financial Data\" in Item 6 - Selected Financial Data.\nRestructuring Plan\nOur senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreement each contain cross-default provisions which permit the acceleration of our indebtedness to them if we default on other indebtedness that results in, or permits, the acceleration of such other indebtedness.\nOur key debt covenants are as follows:\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was consistent in 2018 and 2017.\nForeign Exchange-Exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency are not material, and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings, fair value and cash flows from these transactions are not material. The Company is also exposed to investment risk related to foreign operations. From time to\nCash Flows\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIFO expense\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nEngineered Support Structures (ESS) segment\nThe decrease in Irrigation segment net sales in 2018, as compared to 2017, is primarily due to sales volume decreases, particularly in the international markets. The decrease in international sales can be attributed to project delays and lower overall large project work across most regions. In addition, the weakening of the Brazilian real and Argentina peso in 2018 resulted in lower sales due to currency translation. North America sales increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to higher sales pricing and recent acquisitions. Sales volumes in North America for the year were lower due to continued weak farm income levels. Recent proposed tariffs also caused uncertainly leading farmers to delay irrigation purchases.\nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes. On the first day of fiscal 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard (\"ASC 606\"). Within the Utility Support Structures segment, the steel and concrete product lines now recognize revenue over time whereas in 2017 and years prior, their revenue was recognized at a point in time, which was typically upon product delivery to the customer. The impact of the adoption of ASC 606 in 2018 was an increase in sales of $36.4 million and an increase in operating income of $6.2 million primarily in the Utility segment. It is not practicable to estimate the sales volumes attributable to the adoption of ASC 606 and thus is not a separate line item in the table above. Information on the adoption of the revenue standard can be found under Critical Accounting Policies within Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nMARKET RISK\n\u2022return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases.\n \u2022 $450 million face value ($436.1 million carrying value) of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 5.00% per annum and are due in October 2044. \nNet interest expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, was lower as interest income increased due to more cash on hand to invest. Long-term and short-term borrowings were consistent year-over-year.\nAverage steel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate were higher in North America and China in 2018, as compared to 2017, resulting in higher average cost of material. In general, the average selling prices increased during the year to mitigate decrease in gross profit realized from the higher cost of steel for the Company.\n \u2022 LIBOR (based on a 1 month interest period) plus 100 basis points (inclusive of facility fees),  plus, in each case, 0 to 62.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\nSteel index prices for both hot rolled coil, plate, and zinc in the U.S. increased at a higher rate in 2017, as compared to 2016, which drove higher LIFO expense.\n \u2022 updating the credit facility with certain market provisions.  The interest rate on our borrowings will be, at our option, either:\n \u2022 increased project and promotional expenses of $3.2 million, primarily in the irrigation segment; \nOur cash flows provided by operations was $153.0 million in 2018, as compared with $133.1 million provided by operations in 2017. The increase in operating cash flows was due to lower contributions to the Delta pension plan partially offset by lower net earnings.\nAt December 29, 2018, we had approximately $13.0 million of various long-term liabilities related to certain income tax and other matters. These items are not scheduled above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any potential payments. The contingent consideration payment for Convert Italia SpA has also been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule as the payment is not fixed but dependent on the business exceeding a profitability target for calendar 2018. The $11.6 million accrual at December 29, 2018 is an estimate which will be finalized during the second quarter of 2019.", "item_7_text": "The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment. For our steel and concrete utility and wireless communication structure product lines, we recognize revenue on an inputs basis, using total production hours incurred to-date for each order as a percentage of total hours estimated to produce the order. The completion percentage is applied to the order's total revenue and total estimated costs to determine reported revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit. Our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system captures the total costs incurred to-date and the total production hours, both incurred to-date and forecast to complete. Revenue from the offshore and other complex steel structures business is also recognized using an inputs method, based on the cost-to-cost measure of progress. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation.\nThe increase in net sales in 2018, as compared with 2017, was due to higher sales in the ESS and Coatings segments that were offset by lower sales in the Irrigation, Utility, and Other segments. The changes in net sales in 2018, as compared with 2017, were as follows: \nWe identified thirteen reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill and we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter, which usually coincides with our strategic planning process. We assess the value of our reporting units using after-tax cash flows from operations (less capital expenses) discounted to present value and as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the discount rate and the projected cash flows. We also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units.\n\u2022acquisitions; and\nSteel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate, and zinc in the U.S. increased at a higher rate in 2018, as compared to 2017, resulting in higher LIFO expense.\n \u2022 a modification of the definition of \"EBITDA\" to add-back non-recurring cash and non-cash restructuring costs in an amount that does not exceed $75 million in any trailing twelve month period; \nThe Company divested of its grinding media business in the second quarter of 2018, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of approximately $6.1 million. The grinding media business is reported in Other and the loss was recorded in other income (expenses) on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nMarket Risk-The principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. At times, we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures, but we do not use derivatives for trading purposes.\nSG&A expense was higher in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to higher compensation costs related to improved business operations and currency translation effects. Non-recurring items were recognized in 2018 and 2017 which reduced SG&A. 2018 included the reversal of an environmental remediation liability related to one of our North America galvanizing locations of $1.9 million; in 2017 the business recorded a reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million due to the sale of a former galvanizing operation in Australia. Operating income was higher in 2018 compared to 2017, due to improved sales volumes and the associated operating leverage of fixed costs and improved sales pricing.\nInventories\nWe evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually. Key assumptions are based on the following factors:\nThe $42 million charge was comprised of (a) approximately $9.9 million of expense related to the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings (\"transition tax\"), the federal portion of which is payable over eight (8) years beginning in 2018, (b) approximately $20.4 million of expense related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax balances to reflect the new U.S. corporate income tax rate, using a federal and state tax rate of 25.0%, and (c) approximately $11.7 million of deferred expenses related to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. During 2018, the Company finalized the transition tax which resulted in a credit to tax expense of $0.5 million.\n \u2022 an increase in the available borrowings in foreign currencies from $200 million to $400 million; \nGross profit, as a percentage of sales, and operating income for the segment were lower in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to margin contraction from higher raw material costs that the business was not able to fully recover through higher sales pricing. SG&A spending was lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to lower commissions owed on communication product line sales, reduced incentives due to decreased operating performance, and restructuring costs and activities undertaken in 2016 to reduce the cost structure primarily in the access systems business in Australia.\nRestructuring Plan\nOur most recent impairment test calculated an estimated fair value of our Offshore and other complex steel structures reporting unit that was lower than its carrying value. Lower near-term financial projections and an approximately 15% decline in the undiscounted terminal value applied in the 2018 annual impairment test, when compared to the 2017 annual impairment test, is a result of a challenging pricing environment for onshore wind and energy transmission structures that is difficult to predict when it will recover. As a result, a goodwill impairment was recorded in the third quarter of 2018 totaling $14.4 million, which represents all of the goodwill of the Offshore and other complex steel reporting unit. All of our other reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value, so no additional goodwill was impaired.\nthird quarter of 2018. A number of our sales contracts in North America contain provisions that tie the sales price to published steel index pricing at the time our customer issues their purchase order. Measured in tonnages, sales volumes for steel utility structures in North America were lower whereas concrete utility structure sales volumes were higher in 2018, as compared to 2017. The Company adopted new revenue recognition guidance effective the first day of fiscal 2018; steel and concrete reported sales in 2017 were recognized upon delivery to customers (point in time) whereas reported revenue for 2018 is based on progress of production on customer orders (over time).\nOther\nIrrigation segment\nThe increase in sales in 2018, as compared with 2017, was due to higher sales pricing to cover the higher costs of steel and sales volume increases from acquisitions in 2018.\nIn 2018, we realized a reduction in operating profit, as compared with fiscal 2017, due to currency translation effects. The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows:\nOur effective income tax rate in 2017 and 2016 was 46.5% and 19.1%, respectively. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\" or Act\u201d) includes a number of changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that impact corporations beginning in 2018; including a reduction in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limiting or eliminating certain tax deductions, and changing the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings. Accordingly, the Company recorded a one-time charge of approximately $42 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the transition effects of the Act. Excluding this charge, our effective tax rate would have been 28.1% for 2017. The $42 million charge is comprised of (a) approximately $9.9 million of expense related to the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings, the federal portion of which is payable over eight (8) years beginning in 2018, (b) approximately $20.4 million of expense related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax balances to reflect the new U.S. corporate income tax rate, using a federal and state tax rate of 25.0%, and (c) approximately $11.7 million of deferred expenses related to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. These amounts are provisional and our estimates and overall impact of the Act may change for various reasons including, but not limited to, changes in our interpretation and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by governing authorities, and tax planning actions we may undertake. We continue to gather additional information to fully account for the Act. Any updates and changes in the estimates will be communicated in future quarterly financial statements.\nThe increase in sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, was due to improved roadway product sales volumes and communication product line sales volumes. Global lighting and traffic, and roadway product sales in 2017 were higher compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased sales volumes in roadway product sales, which is a product line outside of North America. In 2017, as compared to 2016, sales volumes in the U.S. were lower across commercial and transportation markets. The 2015 long-term U.S. highway bill has not yet provided a meaningful uplift for our North America structures business. Sales in Europe were lower in 2017 as the domestic markets in general remain subdued. The increase in sales for global lighting and traffic, and roadway product is also attributed to currency translation effects and the acquisition of Aircon in the third quarter of 2017.\nIn 2018, 2017, and 2016, we experienced higher average costs to produce inventory than in the prior year, due mainly to higher cost for steel and steel-related products. This resulted in higher costs of goods sold in 2018, 2017, and 2016 of approximately $9.9 million, $5.7 million, and $3.0 million, respectively, than if our entire inventory had been valued on the FIFO method.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales decreased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to restructuring costs incurred of $4.1 million and lower offshore and complex steel structures sales volumes. SG&A expense was higher in 2018, as compared with 2017, due to the goodwill and trade name impairment recorded for Offshore business of $15.8 million, restructuring expenses, and increased expenses related to the acquisition of Derit and Convert. Excluding restructuring expenses, expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the intangible asset impairment, operating income in 2018 was consistent with 2017.\n \u2022 currency translation effects of $1.9 million (higher SG&A) due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and South African rand against the U.S. dollar. \n \u2022 the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points, and \nGeneral\nUnconditional purchase commitments relate to purchase orders for zinc, aluminum and steel, all of which we plan to use in 2019, and certain capital investments planned for 2019. We believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period. The unconditional purchase commitments also includes the January 2019 purchase of the non-controlling interests of Walpar, LLC for $23.1 million as contractually required per the purchase agreement.\nRevenue Recognition\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome Tax Expense\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAt December 30, 2017, the Company had open foreign currency forward contracts that qualified as net investment hedges. The purpose of the net investment hedges were to mitigate foreign currency risk on a portion of our foreign subsidiary investments in the grinding media business that are denominated in British pounds and Australian dollars. The divestiture of our grinding media business was pending at the end of 2017 and was finalized in the second quarter of 2018. The forward contracts had a maturity date in the first quarter of 2018 and a notional amount to sell British pounds and Australian dollars and receive $24.1 million and $21.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts, the most significant of which was a one-year foreign currency forward contract which qualified as a net investment hedge, in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on a portion of our foreign subsidiary investments denominated in British pounds. The notional amount of this forward contract to sell British pounds was $44.0 million and the contract was settled in May 2017. Much of our cash in non-U.S. entities is denominated in foreign currencies, where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in U.S. dollar terms. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately $18.5 million in 2018 and $37.2 million in 2017.\nacquisitions totaling $143.0 million ($5.4 million in 2017) that was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the grinding media business of $62.5 million. We expect our capital spending for the 2019 fiscal year to be approximately $90.0 million.\nWe also announced our intention to manage our capital structure to maintain our investment grade debt rating. Our most recent ratings were Baa3 by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and BBB+ by Standard and Poor's Rating Services. We would be willing to allow our debt rating to fall to BBB- to finance a special acquisition or other opportunity. We expect to maintain a ratio of debt to invested capital which will support our current investment grade debt rating.\nThe approximate $14.8 million in pre-tax costs ($11.1 million after-tax) associated with refinancing of debt is due to the Company's repurchase through tender of $250.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes due 2020. This expense was comprised of the following:\nAverage steel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate were higher in North America and China in 2017, as compared to 2016, resulting in higher average cost of material. We expect that average selling prices will increase over time to offset the decrease in gross profit realized from the higher cost of steel for the Company. The Company acquired a highway business in India (\"Aircon\") in the third quarter of 2017 that is included in the ESS segment.\n \u2022 CSP Coating Systems (\"CSP Coatings\"), a coatings provider in New Zealand, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2018 that is included in the Coatings segment. \nThe decrease in other income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily due to the reversal of a contingent liability provision of approximately $16.6 million in 2016, out of \"Other noncurrent liabilities.\"\n\nAt a consolidated level, the reduction in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2017, as compared with 2016, was primarily due to higher cost of raw materials across most of our businesses. The Utility segment realized an increase in gross margin in 2017, while ESS, Irrigation, and Coatings realized a decrease in gross profit primarily due to sales pricing that did not fully recover higher raw material costs and unfavorable sales mix. Lower volumes for Coatings and Other also contributed to the reduction in gross margin through deleverage of fixed costs.\n \u2022 Cash prepayment expenses of approximately $15.8 million; plus \n \u2022 We are allowed to repurchase the notes subject to the payment of a make-whole premium. Both tranches of these notes are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries.  On October 18, 2017, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The credit facility provides for $600 million of committed unsecured revolving credit loans. We may increase the credit facility by up to an additional $200 million at any time, subject to lenders increasing the amount of their commitments. The Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries Valmont Industries Holland B.V. and Valmont Group Pty. Ltd., are authorized borrowers under the credit facility. The obligations arising under\nAs a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we reassessed our position with respect to the approximately $400 million of unremitted foreign earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our position is that the previously deferred earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries that were subject to the Transition Tax are not indefinitely reinvested. Further, in 2018 we have taken the position on non-U.S. subsidiaries we are not indefinitely reinvested on their 2018 unremitted foreign earnings. Of our cash balances of $313.2 million at December 29, 2018, approximately $203.6 million is held in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Consequently, with the change in our position on unremitted foreign earnings, if we distributed our foreign cash balances certain taxes would be applicable. At December 29, 2018, we have a liability for foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes of $3.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\nIf our assumptions on discount rates and future cash flows change as a result of events or circumstances, and we believe these assets may have declined in value, then we may record impairment charges, resulting in lower profits. Our reporting units are all cyclical and their sales and profitability may fluctuate from year to year. The Company continues to monitor changes in the global economy that could impact future operating results of its reporting units. If such conditions arise, the Company will test a given reporting unit for impairment prior to the annual test. In the evaluation of our reporting units, we look at the long-term prospects for the reporting unit and recognize that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value, which requires management judgment.\nIn April 2018, the Company completed the sale of Donhad, a mining consumable business with operations in Australia. The Company realized an approximate $6.1 million loss on the sale that is recorded in other income/expense, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\nEngineered Support Structures (ESS) segment\nEffective the first day of fiscal 2018, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Please see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new standard and the cumulative effect from the modified retrospective adjustment.\nWe have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment. These leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts. We also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts.\nIn the Utility segment, sales increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to improved volumes and higher sales prices due to steel cost increases and a favorable sales mix. A number of our sales contracts contain provisions that tie the sales price to published steel index pricing at the time our customer issues their purchase order. Improved sales demand in North America resulted in increased sales volumes in tons for both steel and concrete utility structures that also contributed to the increase in sales. International utility structures sales decreased in 2017 due to lower volumes.\nAccess Systems product line net sales decreased in 2018 by $2.7 million, as compared to 2017. The decrease can be attributed to lower sales volumes in Asia due to less large project work that was partially offset by improved demand in Australia, in part due to efforts to expand our sales reach into architectural and construction markets.\n \u2022 Walpar, a manufacturer of overhead sign structures, in the third quarter of 2018 that is included in the ESS segment. \nCoatings segment sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased sales prices to recover higher zinc costs globally. External sales volumes decreased while intercompany volumes increased in North America during 2017. In the Asia-Pacific region, improved demand/volume in Australia along with currency transaction effects led to an increase in sales in 2017 as compared to 2016.\n \u2022 higher deferred compensation expenses of $2.7 million, which was offset by a decrease of the same amount of other expense; and \n \u2022 Discount rate is based on the yields available on AA-rated corporate bonds with durational periods similar to that of the pension liabilities. \nUtility Support Structures (Utility) segment\nCorporate SG&A expense was lower in 2018 as compared to 2017. The decrease can be attributed to lower deferred compensation expenses of $5.0 million, which is offset by the same amount in other expense, and lower incentive expense. The decrease was partially offset by higher compensation expenses.\nPension Benefits\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names. We assess the values of these assets apart from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing. We use the relief-from-royalty method to evaluate our trade names, under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question. The royalty, which is based on a reasonable rate applied against estimated future sales, is tax-effected and discounted to present value. The most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales, the royalty rate and the after-tax discount rate. For our evaluation purposes, the royalty rates used vary between 0.5% and 1.5% of sales and the after-tax discount rate of 12.0% to 16.0%, which we estimate to be the after-tax cost of capital for such assets.\nFINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS\nWe manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities or by utilizing hedging instruments (as discussed above) where appropriate. The following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our most significant investments at year-end assuming a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.\nOther\nAt a consolidated level, the reduction in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in 2018, as compared with 2017, was primarily due to restructuring costs incurred in the ESS and Utility segments. The Irrigation and Coatings segments realized an increase in gross margin in 2018, while Utility, ESS, and Other realized a decrease in gross margin.\nAccounting for utility structures and wireless communication monopole contracts: Steel and concrete utility and wireless communication monopole structures are engineered to customer specifications resulting in limited ability to sell the structure to a different customer if an order is canceled after production commences. The continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment for work performed to-date plus a reasonable profit as the products do not have an alternative use to us. Since control is transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We have certain wireless communication structures customers' contracts where we do not have the right to payment for work performed. In those instances, we recognize revenue at a point in time which is time of shipment of the structure.\nThe following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements. We must make estimates on a number of items, such as impairments of long-lived assets, income taxes, revenue recognition for the product lines recognized over time, inventory obsolescence, and pension benefits. We base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Further, we re-evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change. Actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions. The selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed annually with our audit committee.\n \u2022 Derit Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (\"Derit\"), a manufacturing facility located in India that is included in both the Utility and Coatings segments. \nthe credit facility are guaranteed by the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries PiRod, Inc., Valmont Coatings, Inc., Valmont Newmark, Inc. and Valmont Queensland Pty. Ltd.\nCoatings segment sales increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to increased sales prices to recover higher zinc costs globally and higher sales volumes. The Company acquired Derit in the third quarter of 2018 and CSP Coatings in the fourth quarter of 2018 that also contributed to higher sales. Sales pricing and volume demand increased in North America in 2018, as compared to 2017. In the Asia-Pacific region, continued improvements in the Australia market along with overall higher sales pricing provided an increase in net sales.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nDelta Ltd. maintains a defined benefit pension plan for qualifying employees in the United Kingdom. There are no active employees as members in the plan. Independent actuaries assist in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with accounting for pension benefits to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses, we must make several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe have historically funded our growth, capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing. In May 2014, our Board of Directors approved and publicly announced a capital allocation philosophy with the following priorities for cash generated:\nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes.\n\nOn a consolidated basis, the increase in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, reflected higher sales in all reportable segments. The changes in net sales in 2017, as compared with 2016, were as follows: \nOperating income was lower for all reportable segments with the exception of Coatings in 2018, as compared to 2017. The decrease is attributed to the impairment of the goodwill and trade name of the Offshore business, restructuring costs incurred in the ESS and Utility segments, and the disposal of the grinding media business included in Other.\nFISCAL 2017 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2016\nWe previously considered the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no related deferred income taxes. Prior to the 2017 Tax Act, we had an excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, including unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $400 million. While the tax on these foreign earnings imposed by the 2017 Tax Act ( Transition Tax\u201d) resulted in the reduction of the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, an actual repatriation from our non-U.S. subsidiaries may still be subject to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes.\nThe Company saw an increase within SG&A expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to the following:\nNet interest expense for 2018 was consistent with 2017. The Company issued $200.0 million and $55.0 million of senior secured notes in June 2018 at 5.0% and 5.25%, respectively. Proceeds from the debt issuance were subsequently used to pay off the 2020 bonds in July 2018.\nCommunication product line sales were lower by $21.9 million in 2018, as compared with 2017. In North America, communication structure and component sales increased in 2018 due to strong demand from the network expansion by providers. In Asia-Pacific, sales volumes decreased due to much lower demand in China for new wireless communication structures.\nCapital Allocation Philosophy\n \u2022 $305 million face value ($297.4 million carrying value) of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 5.25% per annum and are due in October 2054. \n\u2022working capital and capital expenditure investments necessary for future sales growth;\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nTax expense in 2016 included $30.6 million of deferred income tax benefit attributable to the remeasurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Company's U.K. defined benefit pension plan. In addition, we recorded a $9.9 million valuation allowance against a tax credit for which we believe we are not likely to receive the benefit in 2016. Excluding these items as well as the impact of the reversal of the contingent liability of $16.6 million that is not taxable, our adjusted effective tax rate was 30.8% for 2016 versus the GAAP reported effective tax rate of 19.1%.\nNet corporate expense is similar when comparing 2017 to 2016. Approximately $4 million of increased incentive expense was offset by lower pension expense and better performance of the Company's U.S. medical plan as compared to 2016.\n\u2022dividends on common stock in the range of 15% of the prior year's fully diluted net earnings;\n\nIn 2017, as compared to 2016, operating income for all operating segments were higher except for the ESS segment and Other. The increase in operating income in 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily attributable to increased sales volumes in the Utility and Irrigation segments, along with restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 and the associated benefits of the restructuring activities.\nUtility Support Structures (Utility) segment\n (a) LIBOR (based on a 1, 2, 3 or 6 month interest period, as selected by us) plus 100 to 162.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; or  (b) the higher of\nInvesting Cash Flows-Capital spending in fiscal 2018 was $72.0 million, as compared with $55.3 million in fiscal 2017 and $57.9 million in fiscal 2016. Capital spending projects in 2018 included investments in machinery and equipment across all businesses. The increase in investing cash outflows in 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to business\n\n\nOur effective income tax rate in 2018 and 2017 was 30.1% and 46.5%, respectively. The 2018 tax rate was impacted by the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% offset by 2018 restructuring costs and impairment charges for which no tax benefits have been recorded. The 2017 tax rate was impacted by The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\" or Act\u201d) which resulted in a one-time fourth quarter of 2017 charge of approximately $42 million related to the transition effects of the Act. Excluding this charge, our effective tax rate would have been 28.1% for 2017.\n\n \u2022 the prime lending rate, \nOther Income/Expense\nOffshore and other complex structures sales decreased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes that were partially offset by favorable currency translation effects.\nAt December 29, 2018, we had approximately $56.9 million in deferred tax assets relating to tax credits and loss carryforwards, with a valuation allowance of $33.2 million, including $2.3 million in valuation allowances remaining in the Delta entities related to capital loss carryforwards, which are unlikely ever to be realized. If circumstances related to our deferred tax assets change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets, resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income.\nOur businesses are cyclical, but we have diversity in our markets, from a product, customer and a geographical standpoint. We have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage through business cycles and maintain liquidity. We have consistently generated operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures. Based on our available credit facilities, recent issuance of senior unsecured notes and our history of positive operational cash flows, we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs for fiscal 2019 and beyond.\nAt December 29, 2018, we had $5.7 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility has a maturity date of October 18, 2022 and contains certain financial covenants that may limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement. At December 29, 2018, we had the ability to borrow $579.7 million under this facility, after consideration of standby letters of credit of $14.6 million associated with certain insurance obligations. We also maintain certain short-term bank lines of credit totaling $137.7 million; $127.0 million of which was unused at December 29, 2018.\n\nGross profit, as a percentage of sales, and operating income for the segment were lower in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to restructuring costs incurred in 2018. In 2018, the segment incurred $14.3 million of restructuring costs within product cost of sales and $14.2 million within SG&A expense. In addition, approximately $8.0 million of asset impairment costs were incurred related to exiting certain local markets in 2018. SG&A spending was higher in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to restructuring costs and SG&A expenses of Walpar that was acquired in the third quarter of 2018. Operating income decreased primarily from the the $28.5 million of incurred restructuring costs.\nOverview\nCurrency Translation\nOur debt financing at December 29, 2018 consisted primarily of long-term debt. During 2018, the Company issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% senior notes due 2044 and $55 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% senior notes due 2054 and redeemed $250.2 million in remaining aggregate principal amount of the 2020 senior notes. Our long-term debt as of December 29, 2018, principally consists of:\nRisk Management\nIrrigation segment\nIn 2016, we executed a restructuring plan in Australia/New Zealand focused primarily on closing and consolidating locations within the ESS and Coatings segments (the \"2016 Plan\"). We incurred $7.8 million of restructuring expense consisting of $5.0 million in cost of goods sold and $2.8 million in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2016. The Plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2016.\n \u2022 Recognition of $2.0 million of the unamortized premium originally recorded upon the issuance of the 2020 notes. \nOur trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2018 using the relief-from-royalty valuation methodology. We determined that the value of the Valmont SM trade name (offshore and other complex steel reporting unit) was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of $1.4 million. No other trade names were determined to be impaired.\nCash Flows from Operations\nWe determine the appropriate revenue recognition for our contracts by analyzing the type, terms and conditions of each contract or arrangement with a customer. We have no contracts with customers, under any product line, where we could\nIn 2015, we executed a broad restructuring plan (the \"2015 Plan\") to respond to the market environment in certain of our businesses. During 2016, we incurred approximately $4.6 million of restructuring expense to complete the 2015 Plan consisting of $4.1 million in SG&A expense with the remainder recorded in cost of goods sold.\nSources of Financing\nChanges in Prices\n \u2022 Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions. Most of the assets in the pension plan are invested in corporate bonds, the expected return of which are estimated based on the yield available on AA rated corporate bonds. The long-term expected returns on equities are based on historic performance over the long-term. \n \u2022 restructuring expenses incurred in 2016 totaling $6.8 million; and \n \u2022 Leverage ratio - Interest-bearing debt is not to exceed 3.50x Adjusted EBITDA (or 3.75x Adjusted EBITDA after certain material acquisitions) of the prior four quarters; and \nNatural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories, especially in our Coatings segment galvanizing operations, where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot-dipped galvanizing process. Natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments. Our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for 0-50% of our U.S. natural gas requirements for the upcoming 6-12 months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on NYMEX futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged. The objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden, significant increases in the price of natural gas. At December 29, 2018, we have no natural gas swaps outstanding.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved pricing and sales mix and higher sales volumes in North America and improved factory performance for the offshore and other complex structures business. SG&A expense was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to higher incentive expense due to improved operations and commission expense attributed to the increased sales volumes. Operating income increased in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to the increased sales volumes and improved pricing and sales mix in North America.\nCoatings segment\nNet corporate expense\n \u2022 A majority ownership stake in Convert Italia SpA (\"Convert\"), a provider of engineered solar tracker solutions, also acquired during the third quarter of 2018 and included in the Utility segment. \nIn February 2018, the Company announced a restructuring plan related to certain operations in 2018, primarily in the ESS segment, through consolidation and other cost-reduction activities (the \"2018 Plan\"). The Company incurred pre-tax expenses from the 2018 Plan of $34.0 million. The decrease in 2018 gross profit and operating income due to restructuring expense by segment is as follows:\nThe Board of Directors in May 2014 authorized the purchase of up to $500 million of the Company's outstanding common stock from time to time over twelve months at prevailing market prices, through open market or privately-negotiated transactions. The Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million of share purchases, without an expiration date in both February 2015 and again in October 2018. The purchases will be funded from available working capital and short-term borrowings and will be made subject to market and economic conditions. We are not obligated to make any repurchases and may discontinue the program at any time. As of December 29, 2018, we have acquired approximately 5.4 million shares for approximately $732.6 million under these share repurchase programs.\nAt December 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements. The key covenant calculations at December 29, 2018 were as follows (amounts in thousands):\ntime, as market conditions indicate, we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with anticipated future transactions, current balance sheet positions, and foreign subsidiary investments that are in currencies other than the functional currencies of our businesses. At December 29, 2018, the Company had two oustanding foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate foreign currency risk of the Company's investment in its Australian dollar and Euro denominated businesses. The forward contracts, which qualify as net investment hedges, have a maturity date of May 2020 and notional amounts to sell Australian dollars and Euro to receive $100.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively. On August 24, 2018, the Company entered into three fixed-for-fixed cross currency swaps ( CCS\u201d), swapping U.S. dollar principal and interest payments on a portion of its 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2044 for Danish krone (DKK) and Euro denominated payments. The CCS were entered into in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on the Company's Euro and DKK investments and to reduce interest expense. The notional of the two Euro and DKK CCS are $35.0 million and $60.0 million, respectively, and they mature in 2020 to 2023.\nThe material amendments to the credit facility, which are set forth in the amended and restated credit agreement, include:an extension of the maturity date of the credit facility from October 17, 2019 to October 18, 2022;\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was higher in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to improved earnings for our majority-owned irrigation businesses.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial position. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\nThe change in other income/expense in 2018, as compared with 2017, was primarily due to the divestiture of our grinding media business that resulted in a loss of approximately $6.1 million. Excluding the divestiture, higher other income was driven by a periodic pension benefit in 2018 that resulted a beneficial change of $2.8 million. In addition, the change in market value of the Company's shares held of Delta EMD was an improvement of $0.8 million. The remaining change was due to more favorable foreign currency transaction gains/losses in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in other income was partially offset by a change in valuation of deferred compensation assets in 2018 which resulted in additional expense of $5.0 million. This amount is offset by a reduction of the same amount in SG&A expense.\nCommodity risk- Steel hot rolled coil is a significant commodity input used by all of our segments in the manufacture of our products, with the exception of Coatings. Steel prices are volatile and we may utilize derivative instruments to mitigate commodity price risk on fixed price orders. In 2018, the Company entered into steel hot rolled coil forward contracts which qualified as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash flows attributable to future steel purchases. The forward contracts had a notional amount of $8,469 for the purchase of 3,500 short tons for each month from July 2018 to September 2018 and a notional amount of $15,563 for the purchase of 6,500 short tons for each month from October 2018 to December 2018.\nLong-term debt mainly consisted of $755.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes. At December 29, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $5.7 million under our bank revolving credit agreement. Obligations under these agreements may be accelerated in event of non-compliance with debt covenants. The Delta pension plan contributions are\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our management and reporting structure changed to reflect management's expectations of future growth of certain product lines and to take into consideration the expected divestiture of the grinding media business, which historically was reported in the Energy and Mining segment. The access systems applications product line is now part of the Engineered Support Structures (\"ESS\") segment and the offshore and other complex structures product line is now part of the Utility segment. Grinding media will be reported in \"Other\" pending the completion of its divestiture. In the first quarter of 2017, we also changed our reportable segment operating income to separate out the LIFO expense (benefit). Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO method in the consolidated financial statements. Our segment discussions and segment financial information have been accordingly reclassified in this report to reflect this change, for all periods presented.\nThe Company acquired the following companies during 2018:\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nWe also have a few steel structure customer orders in a fiscal year that require one or two years to complete, due to the quantity of structures. Burden rates and routed production hours, per structure, will be adjusted if and when actual costs incurred are significantly higher than what had been originally projected. This resets the timing of revenue recognition for future periods so it is better aligned with the new production schedule. For our offshore and other complex steel structures, we update the estimates of total costs to complete each order quarterly. Based on these updates, revenue in the current period may reflect adjustments for amounts that had been previously recognized. During fiscal 2018, there were no changes to inputs/estimates which resulted in adjustments to revenue for production that occurred prior to the beginning of the quarter. A provision for loss on the performance obligation is recognized if and when an order is projected to be at a loss, whether or not production has started.\nThe discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation was 2.90% at December 29, 2018. The following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension expense for 2019 and the estimated impact on 2019 pension expense relative to a change in those assumptions:\nIncome Taxes\nSG&A was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. The increase can be attributed to higher incentive and commission costs due to improved business results, increased product development and promotional expenses, and currency translation effects related to the international irrigation business. Gross profit and operating income for the segment increased in 2017 over 2016, primarily due to North America and international irrigation sales volume increases and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nThe above increases were partially offset by the following decreases in SG&A expense in 2017 as compared to 2016:\n \u2022 reversal of $3.2 million of a contingent consideration liability in 2016 to the former owners of an acquired business; \nThe increase in Irrigation segment net sales in 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to sales volume increases for both domestic and international irrigation and currency translation effects. In North America, when comparing 2017 to 2016, sales volumes increased driven by markets outside the traditional corn-belt. In addition, higher equipment running times due to weather conditions resulted in higher service parts sales. International sales increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to volume increases in the Middle East and South America and favorable foreign currency translation effects for Brazil and South Africa.\n \u2022 Torrent Engineering and Equipment (\"Torrent\") in the first quarter of 2018 that is included in our Irrigation segment. \nAccess systems product line net sales in 2017 were higher than in 2016, due to higher average sales prices and favorable currency translation effects.\n\nFinancing Cash Flows-Our total interest-bearing debt decreased to $753.3 million at December 29, 2018, from $755.0 million at December 30, 2017. During 2018 and 2016, we acquired approximately 0.8 million shares and 0.4 million shares for $114.8 million and $53.8 million, respectively, under the share repurchase program. No shares were repurchased in 2017.\nLIFO expense\nIn 2017, we realized a benefit to operating profit, as compared with fiscal 2016, due to currency translation effects. The U.S. dollar primarily weakened against the Brazilian real and South African rand, resulting in more operating profit in U.S. dollar terms. The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows:\nA commitment fee is also required under the revolving credit facility which accrues at 10 to 25 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard and Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investor Services, Inc., on the average daily unused portion of the commitment under the revolving credit facility.\nWe are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the various countries in which we operate. The tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly consider the likelihood of additional income tax assessments in each of these taxing jurisdictions based on our experiences related to prior audits and our understanding of the facts and circumstances of the related tax issues. We include in current income tax expense any changes to accruals for potential tax deficiencies. If our judgments related to tax deficiencies differ from our actual experience, our income tax expense could increase or decrease in a given fiscal period.\nCurrency Translation\nWe have future financial obligations related to (1) payment of principal and interest on interest-bearing debt, (2) Delta pension plan contributions, (3) operating leases and (4) purchase obligations. These obligations at December 29, 2018 were as follows (in millions of dollars):\nInterest Rates-Our interest-bearing debt at December 29, 2018 was mostly fixed rate debt. Our notes payable and a small portion of our long-term debt accrue interest at a variable rate. Assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would have affected our interest expense in 2018 and 2017 by approximately $0.1 million. Likewise, we have excess cash balances on deposit in interest-bearing accounts in financial institutions. An increase or decrease in interest rates of ten basis points would have impacted our annual interest earnings in 2018 and 2017 by approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\n \u2022 Recognition of $1.0 million of expense comprised of the write-offs of unamortized loss on the cash flow hedge and deferred financing costs; less \nThese debt agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities, including capital expenditures. These debt agreements allow us to add estimated EBITDA from acquired businesses for periods we did not own the acquired businesses. The debt agreements also provide for an adjustment to EBITDA, subject to certain specified limitations, for non-cash charges or gains that are non-recurring in nature.\nWorking Capital and Operating Cash Flows-Net working capital was $931.6 million at December 29, 2018, as compared with $1,069.6 million at December 30, 2017. The decrease in net working capital in 2018 mainly resulted from lower cash balances mostly attributed to the investing outflow for acquisitions and financing outflow for stock repurchases, and an increase in accrued expense for the Convert contingent consideration liability. Operating cash flow was $153.0 million in 2018, as compared with $133.1 million in 2017 and $232.8 million in 2016. The increase in operating cash flow in 2018, as compared to 2017, was due to lower contributions to the Delta Pension Plan in 2018 partially offset by lower net earnings.\nIn the Utility segment, sales decreased in 2018, as compared with 2017, due to lower sales volumes in North America that are offset by sales price increases to cover higher steel costs and the acquisition of Convert and Derit in the\nCoatings segment\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions. We have assigned useful lives to our property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from 3 to 40 years. Impairment losses were recorded in 2018 as facilities were closed and certain fixed assets are no longer expected to be used as a result of our restructuring plans.\nOther Income/Expense\nCertain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price. The most significant materials are steel, aluminum, zinc and natural gas. Over the last several years, prices for these commodities have been volatile. The volatility in these prices was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply and demand conditions, government tariffs and the costs of steel-making inputs. Steel is most significant for our utility support structures segment where the cost of steel has been approximately 50% of the net sales, on average. In 2018, we began using steel hot rolled coil derivative contracts on a limited basis to mitigate the impact of rising steel prices on operating income. Assuming a similar sales mix, a hypothetical 20% change in the price of steel would have affected our net sales from our utility support structures segment by approximately $64 million for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nWe previously considered the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no related deferred income tax liabilities. The 2017 Tax Act, enacted in December 2017, subjected our unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $400 million to tax at certain specified rates. We made a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation of $9.9 million in 2017. Further, deferred taxes of $11.7 million related to these unremitted foreign earnings were recorded in 2017 for future taxes that will be incurred when cash is repatriated. In 2018, as a result of additional guidance we finalized the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our finalized unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $394 million concluding the transitional tax obligation was $9.3 million. In addition, we have taken the position that on non-U.S. subsidiaries we are not indefinitely reinvested on their 2018 unremitted foreign earnings. Therefore, we recorded income tax expense for foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes of $0.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively during 2018.\nNet corporate expense\nGrinding media sales decreased from lower volumes. A decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by higher sales pricing and favorable currency translation effects. Gross profit and operating income were lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower volumes.\nearn variable consideration. With the exception of our Utility segment and the wireless communication structures product line, our inventory is interchangeable for a variety of the product line's customers. There is one performance obligation for revenue recognition. Our Irrigation and Coatings segments recognize revenue at a point in time, which is when the service has been performed or when the goods ship; this is the same time that the customer is billed. Lighting, traffic, highway safety, and access system product lines within the ESS segment recognize revenue and bill customers at a point in time, which is typically when the product ships or when it is delivered, as stipulated in the customer contract.\nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nThe Company saw an increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to impairment of the goodwill and trade name of the Offshore and other complex structures (\"Offshore\") business totaling $15.8 million, restructuring costs incurred of $15.6 million, SG&A from recently acquired businesses of $9.0 million, and acquisition diligence expenses of $4.4 million. The increase was partially offset by lower deferred compensation expenses of $5.0 million (offset recognized in other expense as described below) and $3.6 million of SG&A in 2017 from the grinding media business divested in 2018.\n \u2022 Inflation is based on the estimated change in the consumer price index ( CPI\u201d) or the retail price index ( RPI\u201d), depending on the relevant plan provisions.  We modified the method used to estimate the interest cost components of the net periodic pension expense in 2017. The new method uses the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the present value of the benefit plan obligations to relevant projected cash outflows for the corresponding year. Prior to 2017, the interest cost components were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate. The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit plan obligation at year-end as the change in interest cost will be offset by an equivalent but opposite change in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).\n \u2022 Interest earned ratio - Adjusted EBITDA over the prior four quarters must be at least 2.50x our interest expense over the same period. \nWe write down slow-moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses, the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory. If our ability to realize value on slow-moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed, additional inventory write downs may be required.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nCommunication product line sales were higher in 2017, as compared with 2016. In North America and Asia-Pacific, communication structure and component sales increased due to higher demand from the continued network expansion by providers.\n \u2022 reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million related to land of a former galvanizing operation in Australia that was sold in 2017. \nOffshore and other complex structures sales decreased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to lower sales volumes that were partially offset by positive effects from currency translation.\nManagement's discussion and analysis, and other sections of this annual report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that management has made in light of experience in the industries in which the Company operates, as well as management's perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions. Many factors could affect the Company's actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things, risk factors described from time to time in the Company's reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as future economic and market circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results, operating efficiencies, availability and price of raw materials, availability and market acceptance of new products, product pricing, domestic and international competitive environments, and actions and policy changes of domestic and foreign governments.\nOverview\nManagement must make assumptions and estimates regarding manufacturing labor hours and wages, the usage and cost of materials, and manufacturing burden / overhead recovery rates for each production facility. For our steel, concrete and wireless communication structures, production of an order, once started, is typically completed within three months. Projected profitability on open production orders is reviewed and updated monthly. We elected the practical expedient to not disclose the partially satisfied performance obligation at the end of the period when the contract has an original expected duration of one year or less.\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income expectations and tax-planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we estimate a deferred tax asset is not likely to be fully realized in the future, a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net earnings in the period the determination was made. Likewise, if we subsequently determine that we are able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made.\nGross Profit, SG&A, and Operating Income\nOur cash flows provided by operations was $133.1 million in 2017, as compared with $232.8 million provided by operations in 2016. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to less favorable working capital changes driven by higher receivables and inventory and higher contributions to the Delta Pension Plan in 2017.\nSG&A was lower in 2018, as compared to 2017. The decrease can be attributed to lower incentives from reduced business operations and currency translation effects which were partially offset by expenses associated with the 2018 acquisitions. Operating income for the segment decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, due to lower sales volumes and the associated operating deleverage of fixed costs and currency translation effects.\n \u2022 a modification of the leverage ratio permitting it to increase from 3.5X to 3.75X for the four consecutive fiscal quarters after certain material acquisitions; and \n \u2022 higher employee incentives of $5.0 million due to improved business operations; \nWe use the last-in first-out (LIFO) method to determine the value of approximately 37% of our inventory. The remaining 63% of our inventory is valued on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis. In periods of rising costs to produce inventory, the LIFO method will result in lower profits than FIFO, because higher recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the FIFO method. Conversely, in periods of falling costs to produce inventory, the LIFO method will result in higher profits than the FIFO method.\nFISCAL 2018 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017\nSG&A expense was lower in 2017, as compared to 2016, due to lower compensation costs and no restructuring expense in 2017. Both 2017 and 2016 had non-recurring transactions recognized as reductions in SG&A. A former galvanizing operation in Australia was sold in 2017 allowing for a reversal of an environmental remediation liability of $2.6 million. In 2016, a contingent consideration liability to the former owners of an acquired business was reduced $3.2 million due to changes in estimated earnings over the earn-out period. Operating income was higher in 2017, as compared with 2016, due to lower SG&A expenses.\nGlobal lighting and traffic, and highway safety product sales in 2018 were $73.4 million higher as compared to 2017, due to higher sales pricing and increased sales volumes. Sales volumes and pricing in North America were higher across commercial and transportation markets and also increased due to the acquisition of Walpar in the third quarter of 2018. Improved sales volumes in Europe contributed to higher sales in 2018, as compared to 2017, along with favorable currency translation effects as the value of the euro appreciated against the U.S. dollar. Sales volumes in Asia-Pacific were higher in India due to improved demand, offset by lower demand in China for lighting and traffic products. Highway safety product sales increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to higher demand in Australia and the acquisition of Aircon in the third quarter of 2017.\nCash Flows from Operations\nThe following provides additional information about our contracts with utility and wireless communication structures customers, where the revenue is recognized over time, the judgments we make in accounting for those contracts, and the resulting amounts recognized in our financial statements.\nWe have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years. Our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to reduce the volatility in our purchase prices and sales price increases where possible. We use natural gas swap contracts on a limited basis to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income.\nrelated to the current cash funding commitments to the plan with the plan's trustees. Operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe calculation of Adjusted EBITDA-last four quarters is presented under the column for fiscal 2018 in footnote (b) to the table \"Selected Five-Year Financial Data\" in Item 6 - Selected Financial Data.\nRestructuring Plan\nOur senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreement each contain cross-default provisions which permit the acceleration of our indebtedness to them if we default on other indebtedness that results in, or permits, the acceleration of such other indebtedness.\nOur key debt covenants are as follows:\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was consistent in 2018 and 2017.\nForeign Exchange-Exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency are not material, and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings, fair value and cash flows from these transactions are not material. The Company is also exposed to investment risk related to foreign operations. From time to\nCash Flows\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIFO expense\nNet Interest Expense and Debt\nEngineered Support Structures (ESS) segment\nThe decrease in Irrigation segment net sales in 2018, as compared to 2017, is primarily due to sales volume decreases, particularly in the international markets. The decrease in international sales can be attributed to project delays and lower overall large project work across most regions. In addition, the weakening of the Brazilian real and Argentina peso in 2018 resulted in lower sales due to currency translation. North America sales increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due to higher sales pricing and recent acquisitions. Sales volumes in North America for the year were lower due to continued weak farm income levels. Recent proposed tariffs also caused uncertainly leading farmers to delay irrigation purchases.\nVolume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes. On the first day of fiscal 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard (\"ASC 606\"). Within the Utility Support Structures segment, the steel and concrete product lines now recognize revenue over time whereas in 2017 and years prior, their revenue was recognized at a point in time, which was typically upon product delivery to the customer. The impact of the adoption of ASC 606 in 2018 was an increase in sales of $36.4 million and an increase in operating income of $6.2 million primarily in the Utility segment. It is not practicable to estimate the sales volumes attributable to the adoption of ASC 606 and thus is not a separate line item in the table above. Information on the adoption of the revenue standard can be found under Critical Accounting Policies within Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nMARKET RISK\n\u2022return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases.\n \u2022 $450 million face value ($436.1 million carrying value) of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 5.00% per annum and are due in October 2044. \nNet interest expense in 2017, as compared to 2016, was lower as interest income increased due to more cash on hand to invest. Long-term and short-term borrowings were consistent year-over-year.\nAverage steel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate were higher in North America and China in 2018, as compared to 2017, resulting in higher average cost of material. In general, the average selling prices increased during the year to mitigate decrease in gross profit realized from the higher cost of steel for the Company.\n \u2022 LIBOR (based on a 1 month interest period) plus 100 basis points (inclusive of facility fees),  plus, in each case, 0 to 62.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating of our senior debt published by Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\nSteel index prices for both hot rolled coil, plate, and zinc in the U.S. increased at a higher rate in 2017, as compared to 2016, which drove higher LIFO expense.\n \u2022 updating the credit facility with certain market provisions.  The interest rate on our borrowings will be, at our option, either:\n \u2022 increased project and promotional expenses of $3.2 million, primarily in the irrigation segment; \nOur cash flows provided by operations was $153.0 million in 2018, as compared with $133.1 million provided by operations in 2017. The increase in operating cash flows was due to lower contributions to the Delta pension plan partially offset by lower net earnings.\nAt December 29, 2018, we had approximately $13.0 million of various long-term liabilities related to certain income tax and other matters. These items are not scheduled above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any potential payments. The contingent consideration payment for Convert Italia SpA has also been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule as the payment is not fixed but dependent on the business exceeding a profitability target for calendar 2018. The $11.6 million accrual at December 29, 2018 is an estimate which will be finalized during the second quarter of 2019.", "item_7_tables": "Table 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Its business is cyclical but diversified across products, customers and geographies. \n\n- Revenue in 2018 was $2.8 billion, relatively flat compared to 2017. Operating income decreased 24% to $202 million due to restructuring costs, impairment charges, and the disposal of a business unit.\n\n- Gross margin declined in 2018 due to higher restructuring costs and lower offshore structures volumes. SG&A increased due to impairment charges, restructuring costs and expenses from recent acquisitions. \n\n- The company has debt of $753 million and credit facilities providing additional borrowing capacity of $580 million. It generates positive cash flow from operations and believes it has adequate liquidity.\n\n- The company is exposed to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. It uses derivative instruments on a limited basis to mitigate some of these risks.\n\n- Revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and goodwill, estimation of tax liabilities, and valuation of inventory using LIFO are identified as critical accounting policies involving significant judgments and estimates.\n\nIn summary, the company showed a decline in profitability in 2018 but maintains adequate liquidity. It continues to face risks from market volatility and uncertain global economic conditions. Critical accounting estimates impact reported results."}
