The merger transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approvals by both DuPont and Dow shareholders. The combined company will be named DowDuPont.\nDuPont and Dow intend to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the board of directors of DowDuPont, the separation of the combined company's agriculture business, specialty products business and material science business through a series of one or more tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the Business Separations.)\nIn connection with the planned merger, the company incurred $10 million in transaction related costs, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSee the discussion entitled Dow DuPont Merger of Equals under Part 1, Item 1 Business of this report, Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details and a discussion of some of the risks related to the transaction.\nPurpose DuPont's businesses serve markets where the increasing demand for more and healthier food, renewably sourced materials and fuels, and advanced industrial materials is creating substantial growth opportunities. The company's unique combination of sciences, proven research and development (R&D) engine, broad global reach, and deep market penetration are distinctive competitive advantages that position the company to continue capitalizing on this enormous potential.\nStrategy DuPont's near term focus is to deliver earnings growth while positioning the businesses to compete successfully over the long term; continue to improve capital allocation and working capital performance; and complete the proposed merger of equals with Dow.\nDuPont has dramatically refined its portfolio to focus investment in areas of significant opportunity and secular growth; enhanced its innovation platform to deliver substantial revenues from new products; increased focus on efficiency, cost discipline, and accountability; and expanded markets geographically. The company is better connecting its laboratories and the marketplace, and striving for faster, more effective execution in delivering innovative solutions for customers.\nThe goal is to increase agility and responsiveness to market conditions, a necessity to win in a globally competitive environment, and drive growth across three strategic priorities: extending leadership in agriculture and nutrition, strengthening and growing advanced materials capabilities, and leveraging science to develop a world leading bio-based industrial business.\nThe company is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth.\nResults Net sales of $25.1 billion, were down 12 percent versus prior year, principally reflecting 7 percent negative impact from currency, 3 percent lower volume and 2 percent negative impact from portfolio changes. Income from continuing operations after income taxes declined from $3.1 billion to $1.9 billion, reflecting lower segment operating earnings, the absence of prior year gains on businesses and other assets, and higher restructuring charges, partially offset by costs savings associated with the 2014 redesign initiative and restructuring plan. Total pre-tax segment operating earnings of $4.2 billion, were 16 percent below last year, principally due to the negative impact of currency of about $785 million and lower volumes driven by weakness in agriculture markets, partially offset by costs savings associated with the 2014 operational redesign initiative and restructuring plan.\nAnalysis of Operations\n2016 Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Plan On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs in 2016 compared with 2015, which represents a reduction of operating costs on a run-rate basis of about $1.0 billion by end of 2016. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them. In connection with the restructuring actions, the company recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of $798 million in the fourth quarter 2015, comprised of $656 million of severance and related benefit costs, $109 million of asset related charges, and $33 million of contract termination costs. Future cash expenditures related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $680 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits. The restructuring actions associated with this charge are expected to impact approximately 10 percent of DuPont's workforce and to be substantially complete in 2016. The company anticipates additional charges could occur in relation to the restructuring actions, which it cannot reasonably estimate at this time.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nRedesign Initiative and 2014 Restructuring Plan In June 2014, DuPont announced its global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to reduce costs and improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions. DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 pre-tax (benefits) charges of $(21) million and $541 million, respectively, were recorded. Cost reductions from the 2014 operational redesign are essentially complete and for full year 2015, the company delivered incremental cost savings of approximately $0.40 per share year over year. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSeparation of Performance Chemicals In October 2013, DuPont announced its intention to separate its Performance Chemicals segment through a U.S. tax-free spin-off to shareholders, subject to customary closing conditions. In July 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (Chemours).\nDivestiture of Performance Coatings In August 2012, the company entered into a definitive agreement with Flash Bermuda Co. Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited liability company formed by affiliates of The Carlyle Group (collectively referred to as \"Carlyle\") in which Carlyle agreed to purchase certain subsidiaries and assets comprising the company's Performance Coatings business. In February 2013, the sale was completed resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax). The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nPart II\nITEM 7.

Lower volume principally reflects a 6 percent decline in Agriculture that was primarily driven by lower seed volume and reduced demand for insect control products in Latin America, and a 7 percent decline in volumes for Electronics & Communications, primarily driven by competitive pressures impacting sales of Solamet\u00ae paste. These declines more than offset volume growth for Performance Materials, Nutrition & Health, and Industrial Biosciences. Portfolio and other reflects the impact of the prior year sales of Glass Laminating Solutions/Vinyls within the Performance Materials segment and Sontara\u00ae within the Safety & Protection segment. The impact from local prices and product mix was about even with prior year as 3 percent higher Agriculture prices were offset primarily by lower prices in Performance Materials and Electronics & Communications. Net sales in developing markets were $8.2 billion, 33 percent of total company net sales versus 34 percent in 2014, representing a slight decline principally due to lower Agriculture volume in Latin America. Developing markets include China, India, countries located in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and South East Asia.\n2014 versus 2013 The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2014 consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from 2013:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change Due to:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in billions)\n</td> <td>2014\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>Percent\nChange vs.\n</td> <td>Local\nPrice and Product Mix\n</td> <td>Currency\n</td> <td>Volume\n</td> <td>Portfolio and Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worldwide\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. & Canada\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA1\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales of $28.4 billion were 2 percent below prior year including a 1 percent reduction from portfolio changes, primarily in the Performance Materials Segment, and a 1 percent negative currency impact reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Local prices were flat as 1 percent higher Agriculture prices were offset by lower prices in Electronics & Communication, primarily from lower metals prices. In developing markets, sales declined 1 percent to $9.7 billion. Sales in developing markets represented 34 percent of total company sales in 2014 and 2013.\nPart II\nITEM 7.

The actions associated with this charge and all related payments are substantially complete.\nThe $112 million in charges recorded during 2013 in employee separation / asset related charges, net consisted of a net $17 million restructuring benefit and a $129 million asset impairment charge discussed below. The net $17 million restructuring benefit consisted of a $26 million benefit associated with prior year restructuring programs offset by a $9 million charge resulting from restructuring actions related to a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. The majority of the $26 million benefit was due to the achievement of work force reductions through non-severance programs associated with the 2012 restructuring program.\nAsset Impairments\nDuring 2015, the company recorded an impairment charge of $38 million in the Other segment, the majority relating to an impairment of a cost basis investment.\nDuring 2013, the company recorded an asset impairment charge of $129 million to write-down the carrying value of an asset group, within the Electronics & Communications segment, to fair value.\nAdditional details related to the restructuring programs and asset impairments discussed above can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBelow is a summary of the net impact related to items recorded in employee separation / asset related charges, net:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015 (Charges) and Credits\n</td> <td>2014 (Charges) and Credits\n</td> <td>2013 (Charges) and Credits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agriculture\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(164\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(134\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electronics & Communications\n</td> <td>(78\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(84\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial Biosciences\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nutrition & Health\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Materials\n</td> <td>(58\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Safety & Protection\n</td> <td>(49\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses\n</td> <td>(319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(810\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(112\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $0.7 billion, reflecting a $0.5 billion decrease from 2014. The decrease was largely due to the impact associated with the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations, the absence of 2014 gains on sales of businesses and other assets in the Performance Materials and Agriculture segments, as well as increased tax benefits on employee separation/asset related charges.\nIn 2014, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $1.2 billion, reflecting a $0.8 billion increase from 2013, largely due to the impact associated with the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary\nPart II\nITEM 7.

These impacts were partially offset by increased tax benefits on employee separation/asset related charges. The higher effective tax rate principally reflects the impact of foreign exchange losses on net monetary assets for which no corresponding tax benefit is realized, in addition to the impact of the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation which is also nondeductible.\nSee Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the provision for income taxes on continuing operations, as well as items that significantly impact the company's effective income tax rate.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AFTER INCOME TAXES\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome from continuing operations after income taxes for 2015 was $1.9 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2014 and $2.2 billion in 2013.

The company expects headwinds from currency due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar which is expected to be most significant in the first half of 2016. Growth in emerging markets is expected to slow, leading to a shift in the company's earnings mix to higher tax jurisdictions. The company expects income from continuing operations in 2016 will benefit from $730 million reduction in costs as a result of the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. These cost reductions will be weighted toward the second half of 2016 reflecting implementation of specific actions during the first and second quarters. In addition, the company expects income from continuing operations in 2016 to be impacted by transaction related costs associated with the proposed merger with Dow. See additional information regarding 2016 outlook under \"Segment Reviews\" beginning on page 30.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nSegment Reviews\nSegment operating earnings is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes excluding significant pre-tax benefits (charges), non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and interest. Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs includes all of the components of net periodic benefit cost from continuing operations with the exception of the service cost component. Reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year classifications. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details related to significant pre-tax benefits (charges) excluded from segment operating earnings. All references to prices are on a U.S. dollar (USD) basis, including the impact of currency, unless otherwise noted.\nA reconciliation of segment operating earnings to income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2015, 2014 and 2013 is included in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuPont Sustainable Solutions, within the company's Safety & Protection segment, is comprised of two business units: clean technologies and consulting solutions. Effective January 1, 2016, the clean technologies business unit will become part of the Industrial Biosciences segment with the focus on working with customers to improve the performance, productivity and sustainability of their products and processes. The company will explore a range of options to maximize the growth of the consulting solutions business unit which effective January 1, 2016 will be reported within Other. Sustainable solutions net sales accounted for about 2 percent of the company's total consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Segment results and 2016 segment outlook information are not reflective of the 2016 reporting change.\nPart II\nITEM 7.

In Brazil, lower corn seed volume reflects the impact of a reduction in summer planted hectares of corn and fall armyworm resistance impacting performance of certain corn hybrids. In North America, lower soybean volume reflects between 1 and 2 points of share loss and lower soybean planted area; lower corn planted area was partially offset by higher local corn seed prices. Lower crop protection volume is primarily due to low expected insect pressure, the adoption of insect protected soybean varieties, higher inventories, and a challenging macro environment. Insect control volumes were also impacted by the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility in Texas.\n2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin decreased primarily due to the negative impact of currency of $538 million, lower sales, and an approximately $120 million negative impact of the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility and the absence of prior year impacts from performance-based compensation adjustments, partially offset by cost reductions and continued productivity improvements.\n2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $11.3 billion decreased $0.4 billion, or 4 percent, primarily due to lower corn seed volumes in Brazil and North America and the negative impact of currency, which was partly offset by an increase in crop protection volumes and higher local corn seed prices. In Brazil, corn seed market share and price were lower reflecting the impact of fall armyworm resistance and a reduction in planted hectares of corn. Higher volumes in insecticides were driven by continued growth in Rynaxypyr\u00ae insecticide and from successful launches of Cyazypyr\u00ae insecticide and new seed treatments in several markets.\n2014 operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower corn seed volumes and the negative impact of currency which were partially offset by higher crop protection volumes, lower performance-based compensation expense of approximately $110 million, higher local seed prices and lower seed input costs. Operating earnings margin was about the same in each period.\nOutlook Farmer net returns for row crops continue to trend down as land and rent prices have lagged the transition on lower commodity prices as grain stocks remain at elevated levels. The company expects the economic environment in the agriculture sector to remain challenged with corn and soybean commodity prices at the low end of normal until demand accelerates or there is a disruption in global production. Volatile currency markets are expected to continue to present headwinds given the size of DuPont Agriculture's businesses in Europe and Latin America. As farmers look to relative economics between crop alternatives, the company expects a slight year over year increase in Brazil Safrinha and North America corn area, provided weather cooperates during planting. Pioneer's order book in North America suggests a modest improvement in corn demand at the expense of soybeans in a highly competitive seed market. In crop protection, continued weak demand for foliar-applied insecticides in Brazil and elevated distributor inventories will continue to present challenges.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nFor the first half of 2016, which reflects the majority of the northern hemisphere season, the company expects Agriculture sales to be mid-single digits percent lower with operating earnings in the low-teens percent below 2015 as local price gains and the benefit of cost actions are more than offset by lower insecticide and soybean volumes and currency. Crop protection's volume forecast assumes a continued impact from the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility. Volumes will be more challenged in the first quarter, due to the strong start in North America corn seed which benefited the fourth quarter of 2015, and due to crop protection in Brazil.\nFull year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be down mid-single digits percent and full year operating earnings are expected to be about flat as local price gains and cost actions are offset by currency headwinds and lower volumes.\nELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATIONS\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings margin\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in net sales from prior period due to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Local Price and Product Mix\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio and Other\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $2.1 billion decreased $0.3 billion, or 13 percent, primarily due to competitive pressures impacting Solamet\u00ae paste and lower pricing from the pass-through of lower metals prices and the negative impact of currency, partially offset by volume growth in Tedlar\u00ae film photovoltaics and products for the consumer electronics market.\n2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements more than offset lower sales.\n2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $2.4 billion decreased $0.2 billion, or 6 percent, as volume growth in several product lines was more than offset by pass-through of lower metals prices and by competitive pressures impacting Solamet\u00ae paste.\n2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased due to volume growth and productivity improvements. These were partly offset by the absence of $20 million of OLED technology licensing income realized during 2013.\nOutlook In 2016 the company expects the photovoltaic market to remain strong with module installations forecasted to increase mid-teens percent driving strong growth in Tedlar\u00ae film in photovoltaics. Segment results are expected to continue to be negatively impacted by declines in Solamet\u00ae paste with the impact lessening in the second half of the year due to more favorable year-over-year comparisons and expected new product introductions. The company anticipates consumer electronics markets will have a weaker start to the year but strengthen in the second half as channel inventories are worked off.\nFull year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be about flat as strong volume growth in Tedlar\u00ae film for photovoltaics is offset by lower sales of Solamet\u00ae paste and lower metals pricing.

The company continually reviews its sources of liquidity and debt portfolio and occasionally may make adjustments to one or both to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum debt maturity schedule.\nThe company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings are as follows:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Long-term\n</td> <td>Short-term\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>Credit Watch Negative\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch Ratings\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>F1\n</td> <td>Rating Watch Negative\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn May 2015, Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) downgraded the company's long-term rating to A3 from A2, and the short-term rating to P-2 from P-1. In October 2015, Standard and Poor's Rating Services (Standard and Poor's) downgraded the company's long-term rating to A- from A, and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. In December 2015 following the announcement of the Merger Agreement with Dow, Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings placed the outlook on the company's long-term and the short-term rating on negative watch and Moody's placed the company on negative outlook.\nThe company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt maturities and other cash needs and that its current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings continue to provide access as needed to the capital markets. While the company expects that capacity for its commercial paper could be reduced as a result of its current short-term credit ratings, the company's liquidity needs can continue to be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing, committed receivable repurchase facilities and asset sales.\nThe company has access to approximately $4.9 billion in unused credit lines, which includes a $4 billion revolving credit facility to support its commercial paper program, with several major financial institutions. These unused credit lines provide additional support to meet short-term liquidity needs and general corporate purposes including letters of credit.\nIn February 2016, in line with seasonal agricultural working capital requirements, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase agreement of up to $1 billion (the repurchase facility) that expires on November 30, 2016. Under the facility, the company may sell a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables within the Agriculture segment to participating institutions and simultaneously agree to repurchase at a future date. See further discussion of this facility in Item 9B, Other Information and Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nThe company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are $6.2 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. of $4.2 billion and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are generally utilized to fund local operating activities and capital expenditure requirements and are expected to support non-U.S. liquidity needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. The company expects domestic liquidity needs, for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter, will be met through existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. and the various sources of liquidity discussed above. Therefore, the company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic liquidity to support its assumption that undistributed earnings at December 31, 2015 can be considered reinvested indefinitely.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $1.4 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the absence of Chemours in the second half of 2015 compared with a full year of results in 2014 for an impact of approximately $1.0 billion and a lower cash earnings contribution from continuing operations of approximately $0.3 billion.\nCash provided by operating activities increased $0.5 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower year over year income tax payments associated with the sale of businesses and higher insurance recoveries and lower claims payments related to Imprelis\u00ae (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used for) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,828\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(337\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash used for investing activities in 2015 increased by $1.5 billion compared to 2014. The change was primarily due to lower proceeds received from the sale of businesses in 2015 compared to 2014 and increase purchases of marketable securities in 2015 compared to 2014. This was partially offset by lower purchases of property, plant and equipment, mainly due to the absence of Chemours in the second half of 2015 which accounted for $0.3 billion. See Note 20 for further discussion of marketable securities outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCash used for investing activities in 2014 decreased $3.3 billion compared to 2013.

Dividends per share of common stock were $1.72, $1.84, and $1.78 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In January 2016, the Board of Directors declared a first quarter common stock dividend of $0.38 per share. With the first quarter 2016 dividend, the company has paid quarterly consecutive dividends since the company's first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nIn the first quarter 2015, DuPont announced its intention to buy back shares of about $4 billion using the distribution proceeds received from Chemours. In connection with the completion of the spin-off of Chemours, the Board of Directors authorized the use of the distribution proceeds to buy back shares of the company's common stock as follows: $2 billion to be purchased and retired by December 31, 2015 with the remainder to be purchased and retired by December 31, 2016. In August 2015, the company entered an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. Under the terms of the August 2015 ASR agreement, the company paid $2 billion to the financial institution and received and retired 35 million shares at an average price of $57.16 per share. See Part I, Item 5 Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDuPont's objective continues to be to complete the remaining $2 billion stock buyback by year end December 31, 2016. However, as a result of the planned merger of equals with Dow, the company expects it will have limited opportunities to enter the market prior to the shareholder vote on the merger. After the vote, the company plans to make repurchases.\nIn January 2014, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan. In February and August 2014, the company entered into two separate ASR agreements. The February 2014 ASR agreement was completed in the second quarter of 2014, under which the company purchased and retired 15.1 million shares for $1 billion. The August 2014 ASR agreement was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, under which the company purchased and retired 10.4 million shares for $700 million. In addition to the ASR agreements, in 2014, the company repurchased and retired 4.7 million shares in the open market for a total cost of $300 million. In 2015, the company repurchased and retired 4.6 million shares in the open market for a total cost of $353 million. As a result, the company has completed $2.4 billion of repurchases as of December 31, 2015. The remainder of the $5 billion share buyback will be purchased in future periods as there is no required completion date for purchases under the 2014 plan.\nIn December 2012, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share buyback plan. In 2013, the company entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution under which the company used $1 billion of the proceeds from the sale of Performance Coatings for the purchase and retirement 20.4 million shares of common stock.\nSee Note 17 Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the above share buyback plans.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>(1,629\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2,020\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,882\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow is a measurement not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, and therefore indicates operating cash flow available for payment of dividends, other investing activities and other financing activities. Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process.\nFor further information relating to the change in cash provided by operating activities, see discussion above under cash provided by operating activities.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nLong-term Employee Benefits\nAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.\nAbout 80 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S. the discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plan's actuary as of the measurement date. For non-U.S. benefit plans, the company utilizes prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date.\nWithin the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plans' assets.\nIn determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in billions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market-related value of assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of plan assets\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nThe company changed the method it used to estimate the 2016 service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. benefit plans. For these plans, the company has historically estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve and cash flow for measurement of the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The company will utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these 2016 components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The company made this change as it believes it is a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The company considers this a change in estimate, and, accordingly, will account for it prospectively starting in 2016. This change does not affect the measure of the total benefit obligation. See information with the respect to the impact of the change in method on 2016 pension expense under \"Long-term Employee Benefits\" beginning on page 45.\nThe following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)\n(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>1/2 Percentage\nPoint\nIncrease\n</td> <td>1/2 Percentage\nPoint\nDecrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn October 2014, the Society of Actuaries released final reports of new mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale for measurement of retirement program obligations in the U.S. The company adopted these tables in measuring the 2014 long-term employee benefit obligations. This adoption increased the benefit obligation at December 31, 2014 by approximately $1.7 billion. The effect of this adoption was amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2015. In October 2015, the Society of Actuaries released an updated mortality improvement scale reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the October 2014 release. This release was adopted by the company in measuring the 2015 long-term employee benefit obligations in the U.S. This adoption decreased the benefit obligation at December 31, 2015 by approximately $0.4 billion. The effect of this adoption will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2016.\nAdditional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under \"Long-term Employee Benefits\" beginning on page 45 and in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nDuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company has recorded a liability of $492 million as of December 31, 2015; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $1.0 billion above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2015.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nLegal Contingencies\nThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIndemnification Assets\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the distribution. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these indemnified matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the Separation Agreement and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as solvency of Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable.\nIncome Taxes\nThe breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that net reductions to the company's global unrecognized tax benefits could be in the range of $225 million to $250 million within the next 12 months with the majority due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions with various tax authorities.\nDeferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material.\nAt December 31, 2015, the company had a deferred tax asset balance of $3.4 billion, net of valuation allowance of $1.5 billion. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax asset balance.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nValuation of Assets\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.\nAssessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets, investments in affiliates and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.\nBased on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test, completed in the third quarter 2015, we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The company's methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units is using the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction analyses. There can be no assurance that the company's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow and revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate.\nIn the fourth quarter 2015, the company elected to defer further testing and deployment of a multi-year, phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. At December 31, 2015, the company has capitalized costs associated with the ERP system of approximately $435 million which have not yet been placed in service. It remains probable that the ERP system will be completed and placed in service.\nPart II\nITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nLong-term Employee Benefits\nThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other long-term employee benefits). Approximately 80 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.\nThe majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.\nBenefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. No contributions were made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2015 and the company expects to contribute $230 million to this plan in 2016.\nFunding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $164 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan in 2015.\nU.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $144 million to its unfunded plans in 2015.\nThe company's other long-term employee benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $237 million, $233 million and $207 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.\nIn 2016, the company expects to contribute about the same as 2015 for pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, its remaining plans with no plan assets and its other long-term employee benefit plans.\nThe company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as other long-term employee benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term employee benefit plan charges 1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>The long-term employee benefit plan charges include discontinued operations of $(245), $96 and $113 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2015 is due to a curtailment gain partially offset by a decrease in discount rate. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2014 is primarily related to higher discount rates and better than expected pension asset returns. See \"Long-term Employee Benefits\" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 40 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nThe company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2016, long term employee benefits expense from continuing operations is expected to decrease by about $230 million due to the adoption of the full yield curve approach and a higher discount rate which will be partially offset by a lower expected return on plan assets for the US pension plan from 8.5% to 8.0%. The adoption of the full yield curve approach will reduce 2016 expense by $210 million as a result of a $10 million and $200 million reduction in service and interest cost components, respectively. The estimated 2016 long term employee benefit expense from continuing operations does not include the impact of any settlement losses or curtailment gains resulting from actions associated with the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring program, as it cannot be estimated at this time.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future.\nPre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations are summarized below:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental operating costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in remediation accrual\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAbout 75 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2015 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.\nEnvironmental Operating Costs\nAs a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials.\nRemediation Accrual\nChanges in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remediation payments\n</td> <td>(75\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in remediation accrual\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remediation payments\n</td> <td>(104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in remediation accrual\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>492\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nConsiderable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $1.0 billion above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2015. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company.\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters, included in the liability of $492 million, that have an estimated liability of $291 million as of December 31, 2015 and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately $610 million above the amount accrued. As such, the company has recorded an indemnification asset of $291 million corresponding to the company's accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 100 sites for which DuPont does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at approximately 140 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 190 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in \"de minimis buyouts\" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at one new site during 2015 compared with three and five similar notices in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nEnvironmental Capital Expenditures\nIn 2015, the company spent approximately $20 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be about $40 million in 2016. In the U.S., additional capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding estimates for future capital expenditures. However, management does not believe that the costs to comply with these requirements will have a material impact on the financial position or liquidity of the company.\nClimate Change\nThe company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. Expanding upon significant global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2010, as of 2014 the company reduced its environmental footprint, achieving reductions of 9 percent in GHG emissions intensity and 8 percent in water consumption versus a 2010 baseline. In addition, as of 2014, the company achieved an 11 percent reduction in energy intensity from non-renewable resources versus a 2010 baseline. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy.\nThe company is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. Such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate.\nThere are existing efforts to address GHG emissions at the national and regional levels. Several of the company's facilities in the European Union (EU) are regulated under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. China has begun pilot programs for carbon taxes and trading of GHG emissions in selected areas. The current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., where many company facilities are located, adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions, particularly those relating to long-term capital investments.\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nIn 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a phased-in scheme to regulate GHG emissions first from large stationary sources under the existing CAA permitting requirements administered by state and local authorities. Large capital investments may be required to install Best Available Control Technology on major new or modified sources of GHG emissions. In 2015, the EPA promulgated regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from new and reconstructed/modified Electric Generating Units (EGU's). In 2015, the EPA also promulgated new regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from existing EGUs that would be based on individual state emission reduction programs. These regulations are currently being challenged in the U.S. federal court. If the regulations survive these challenges, they may affect the long term price and supply of electricity and natural gas and demand for products that contribute to energy efficiency and renewable energy. The precise impact of the aforementioned regulations is uncertain due to the flexibility provided to the states in developing their programs and anticipated legal challenges to this regulatory approach. A comprehensive national policy that addresses climate change by relying on market-based mechanisms to drive reductions in greenhouse gases is likely to be more economically efficient than the facility-by-facility controls that would result from implementation of recently promulgated rules under EPA's existing authorities.\nAt the international level, significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace, highlighting the need for coordinated global policy actions. An effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology, while maintaining open and competitive global markets.\nPart II", "item_7_truncated": "2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $1.2 billion increased 3 percent, primarily due to increased enzyme demand, principally for ethanol production, food and animal nutrition, driven by new product offerings.

In addition, pre-tax exchange gains decreased $166 million compared to prior year driven by lower gains on foreign currency exchange contracts. See Note 5 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by $145 million gain associated with the company's settlement of a legal claim related to the Safety & Protection segment and $85 million increase in equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to the absence of $65 million for charges associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment recorded in 2014.\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change Due to:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in billions)\n</td> <td>2014\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>Percent\nChange vs.\n</td> <td>Local\nPrice and Product Mix\n</td> <td>Currency\n</td> <td>Volume\n</td> <td>Portfolio and Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worldwide\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. & Canada\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA1\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuPont Sustainable Solutions, within the company's Safety & Protection segment, is comprised of two business units: clean technologies and consulting solutions.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $3.5 billion decreased $0.4 billion, or 9 percent, primarily due to the negative impact of currency, the portfolio impact of the Sontara\u00ae divestiture, and lower volume. Decreased demand for Sustainable Solution offerings, Nomex\u00ae thermal resistant fiber and Kevlar\u00ae high strength materials was driven by a weakened oil and gas industry and military spending delays, partially offset by volume growth for Tyvek\u00ae protective material, including medical packaging.\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $9.8 billion decreased $1.5 billion, or 13 percent, primarily due to the negative impact of currency and lower seed and crop protection volumes, primarily in Brazil and North America, which were partly offset by higher local corn seed prices. In Brazil, lower corn seed volume reflects the impact of a reduction in summer planted hectares of corn and fall armyworm resistance impacting performance of certain corn hybrids. In North America, lower soybean volume reflects between 1 and 2 points of share loss and lower soybean planted area; lower corn planted area was partially offset by higher local corn seed prices. Lower crop protection volume is primarily due to low expected insect pressure, the adoption of insect protected soybean varieties, higher inventories, and a challenging macro environment. Insect control volumes were also impacted by the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility in Texas.\nDuPont's objective continues to be to complete the remaining $2 billion stock buyback by year end December 31, 2016.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material.\n\nSee Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the the Imprelis\u00ae matter.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings margin\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPart II\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMPLOYEE SEPARATION/ASSET RELATED CHARGES, NET\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\n 2.

The August 2014 ASR agreement was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, under which the company purchased and retired 10.4 million shares for $700 million. In addition to the ASR agreements, in 2014, the company repurchased and retired 4.7 million shares in the open market for a total cost of $300 million. In 2015, the company repurchased and retired 4.6 million shares in the open market for a total cost of $353 million. As a result, the company has completed $2.4 billion of repurchases as of December 31, 2015.

Partially offsetting the declines are increased ethylene volumes due to the prior year scheduled outage at the ethylene unit in Orange, Texas and increased demand for Performance Polymers offerings in automotive markets, primarily in the U.S. and Europe in the second half of 2015.\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $2.1 billion decreased $0.3 billion, or 13 percent, primarily due to competitive pressures impacting Solamet\u00ae paste and lower pricing from the pass-through of lower metals prices and the negative impact of currency, partially offset by volume growth in Tedlar\u00ae film photovoltaics and products for the consumer electronics market.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nIn 2014, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $1.2 billion, reflecting a $0.8 billion increase from 2013, largely due to the impact associated with the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary\nPart II\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nAnalysis of Operations\nAdditional details related to the restructuring programs and asset impairments discussed above can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nIn 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a phased-in scheme to regulate GHG emissions first from large stationary sources under the existing CAA permitting requirements administered by state and local authorities. Large capital investments may be required to install Best Available Control Technology on major new or modified sources of GHG emissions. In 2015, the EPA promulgated regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from new and reconstructed/modified Electric Generating Units (EGU's). In 2015, the EPA also promulgated new regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from existing EGUs that would be based on individual state emission reduction programs. These regulations are currently being challenged in the U.S. federal court. If the regulations survive these challenges, they may affect the long term price and supply of electricity and natural gas and demand for products that contribute to energy efficiency and renewable energy. The precise impact of the aforementioned regulations is uncertain due to the flexibility provided to the states in developing their programs and anticipated legal challenges to this regulatory approach. A comprehensive national policy that addresses climate change by relying on market-based mechanisms to drive reductions in greenhouse gases is likely to be more economically efficient than the facility-by-facility controls that would result from implementation of recently promulgated rules under EPA's existing authorities.\n 1. The long-term employee benefit plan charges include discontinued operations of $(245), $96 and $113 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nIncome from continuing operations after income taxes for 2015 was $1.9 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2014 and $2.2 billion in 2013. The changes between periods were due to the reasons noted above.\n2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $3.9 billion were essentially equal to prior year, as increased demand for Nomex\u00ae thermal resistant fiber and Kevlar\u00ae high strength materials was offset by impact of portfolio changes and lower sales for clean technologies offerings.\n2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $3.5 billion increased 2 percent, as volume growth in specialty proteins, cultures and probiotics, was partially offset by a negative impact from currency.\n2016 Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Plan On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs in 2016 compared with 2015, which represents a reduction of operating costs on a run-rate basis of about $1.0 billion by end of 2016. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them. In connection with the restructuring actions, the company recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of $798 million in the fourth quarter 2015, comprised of $656 million of severance and related benefit costs, $109 million of asset related charges, and $33 million of contract termination costs. Future cash expenditures related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $680 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits. The restructuring actions associated with this charge are expected to impact approximately 10 percent of DuPont's workforce and to be substantially complete in 2016. The company anticipates additional charges could occur in relation to the restructuring actions, which it cannot reasonably estimate at this time.\nThe $810 million in charges recorded during 2015 in employee separation / asset related charges, net consist of a $793 million charge related to the 2016 restructuring plan discussed below, a $38 million impairment charge discussed below, partly offset by a $21 million net benefit related to the 2014 restructuring plan. The $21 million net benefit was recorded to adjust the estimated costs associated with the 2014 restructuring program due to lower than estimated individual severance costs and workforce reductions achieved through non-severance programs, offset by the identification of additional projects in certain segments.\nCash provided by operating activities increased $0.5 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower year over year income tax payments associated with the sale of businesses and higher insurance recoveries and lower claims payments related to Imprelis\u00ae (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\n\nIn the fourth quarter 2015, the company elected to defer further testing and deployment of a multi-year, phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. At December 31, 2015, the company has capitalized costs associated with the ERP system of approximately $435 million which have not yet been placed in service. It remains probable that the ERP system will be completed and placed in service.\n 5. Pension and other long-term employee benefit obligations have been excluded from the table above. Expected 2016 funding for the principal U.S. pension plan and non-U.S. plans with plan assets is disclosed below within Long Term Employee Benefits. Contributions beyond 2016 are expected to be made, however, the amount of contributions are dependent on the future economic environment, investment returns on pension trust assets, as well as rules and regulations of the respective country in which the plans operate. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets and other long-term employee benefits plans are paid from operating cash flows. The benefit payments for these plans are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of benefit payments are uncertain. The estimated benefit payments in 2016 for these plans are disclosed below within Long Term Employee Benefits. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. \nOutlook Farmer net returns for row crops continue to trend down as land and rent prices have lagged the transition on lower commodity prices as grain stocks remain at elevated levels. The company expects the economic environment in the agriculture sector to remain challenged with corn and soybean commodity prices at the low end of normal until demand accelerates or there is a disruption in global production. Volatile currency markets are expected to continue to present headwinds given the size of DuPont Agriculture's businesses in Europe and Latin America. As farmers look to relative economics between crop alternatives, the company expects a slight year over year increase in Brazil Safrinha and North America corn area, provided weather cooperates during planting. Pioneer's order book in North America suggests a modest improvement in corn demand at the expense of soybeans in a highly competitive seed market. In crop protection, continued weak demand for foliar-applied insecticides in Brazil and elevated distributor inventories will continue to present challenges.\nPart II\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nFor some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements, see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 10.\nassets and liabilities of its operations, gains on sales of businesses and other assets in the Performance Materials and Agriculture segments, and the impact of Imprelis\u00ae charges in 2013 versus additional insurance recoveries in 2014. These impacts were partially offset by increased tax benefits on employee separation/asset related charges. The higher effective tax rate principally reflects the impact of foreign exchange losses on net monetary assets for which no corresponding tax benefit is realized, in addition to the impact of the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation which is also nondeductible.\nAdditional information related to the company's other income, net is included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPart II\nConsiderable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $1.0 billion above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2015. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 100 sites for which DuPont does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at approximately 140 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 190 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in \"de minimis buyouts\" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at one new site during 2015 compared with three and five similar notices in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nChanges in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:\nDuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company has recorded a liability of $492 million as of December 31, 2015; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $1.0 billion above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2015.\nContractual Obligations\n2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin decreased primarily due to the negative impact of currency of $538 million, lower sales, and an approximately $120 million negative impact of the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility and the absence of prior year impacts from performance-based compensation adjustments, partially offset by cost reductions and continued productivity improvements.\nIn connection with the planned merger, the company incurred $10 million in transaction related costs, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nSegment Reviews\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nPart II\nAsset Impairments\nThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other long-term employee benefits). Approximately 80 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nSegment operating earnings is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes excluding significant pre-tax benefits (charges), non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and interest. Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs includes all of the components of net periodic benefit cost from continuing operations with the exception of the service cost component. Reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year classifications. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details related to significant pre-tax benefits (charges) excluded from segment operating earnings. All references to prices are on a U.S. dollar (USD) basis, including the impact of currency, unless otherwise noted.\n2015 versus 2014 The $276 million decrease was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus global currencies, cost savings from the company's operational redesign initiative, and lower selling and commission expense, mainly within the Agriculture segment, partially offset by an increase in pension and OPEB costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 1 percent, primarily due to lower sales and higher pension and OPEB costs.\nValuation of Assets\n\nCurrent difficult global economic conditions in agriculture and slower growth in emerging markets are expected to continue challenging the company's sales growth in 2016. The company expects headwinds from currency due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar which is expected to be most significant in the first half of 2016. Growth in emerging markets is expected to slow, leading to a shift in the company's earnings mix to higher tax jurisdictions. The company expects income from continuing operations in 2016 will benefit from $730 million reduction in costs as a result of the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. These cost reductions will be weighted toward the second half of 2016 reflecting implementation of specific actions during the first and second quarters. In addition, the company expects income from continuing operations in 2016 to be impacted by transaction related costs associated with the proposed merger with Dow. See additional information regarding 2016 outlook under \"Segment Reviews\" beginning on page 30.\n\n2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased due to volume growth and productivity improvements. These were partly offset by the absence of $20 million of OLED technology licensing income realized during 2013.\n \u2022 Conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, including economic factors such as inflation, deflation, fluctuation in currency rates, interest rates and commodity prices; \nBenefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. No contributions were made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2015 and the company expects to contribute $230 million to this plan in 2016.\n2014 versus 2013 Other operating charges decreased $577 million to $645 million, and decreased as a percentage of sales by 2 percent, principally due to the absence of prior year charges for Imprelis\u00ae herbicide claims and current year insurance recoveries.\nDuPont has dramatically refined its portfolio to focus investment in areas of significant opportunity and secular growth; enhanced its innovation platform to deliver substantial revenues from new products; increased focus on efficiency, cost discipline, and accountability; and expanded markets geographically. The company is better connecting its laboratories and the marketplace, and striving for faster, more effective execution in delivering innovative solutions for customers.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\n\nPart II\nThere are existing efforts to address GHG emissions at the national and regional levels. Several of the company's facilities in the European Union (EU) are regulated under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. China has begun pilot programs for carbon taxes and trading of GHG emissions in selected areas. The current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., where many company facilities are located, adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions, particularly those relating to long-term capital investments.\nFor further information relating to the change in cash provided by operating activities, see discussion above under cash provided by operating activities.\nThe majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.\n2015 versus 2014 Other operating charges decreased $186 million, or 29 percent, principally reflecting $130 million reduction in the estimated liability related to Imprelis\u00ae herbicide claims, cost savings from the company's operational redesign initiative partially offset by lower insurance recoveries year over year related to Imprelis\u00ae herbicide claims.\nThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThis report contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words like plans,\u201d expects,\u201d will,\u201d anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d intends,\u201d projects,\u201d estimates\u201d or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company's strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position, anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions, timing of anticipated benefits from restructuring actions, outcome of contingencies, such as litigation and environmental matters, expenditures, financial results, and timing of, as well as expected benefits, including synergies, from the proposed merger with The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) and intended post-merger separations, are forward-looking statements.\nThe following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015:\n2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $2.4 billion decreased $0.2 billion, or 6 percent, as volume growth in several product lines was more than offset by pass-through of lower metals prices and by competitive pressures impacting Solamet\u00ae paste.\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.\n 1. Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). \nInformation related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table:\n\n\nIn May 2015, Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) downgraded the company's long-term rating to A3 from A2, and the short-term rating to P-2 from P-1. In October 2015, Standard and Poor's Rating Services (Standard and Poor's) downgraded the company's long-term rating to A- from A, and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. In December 2015 following the announcement of the Merger Agreement with Dow, Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings placed the outlook on the company's long-term and the short-term rating on negative watch and Moody's placed the company on negative outlook.\nIn 2015, the company spent approximately $20 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be about $40 million in 2016. In the U.S., additional capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding estimates for future capital expenditures. However, management does not believe that the costs to comply with these requirements will have a material impact on the financial position or liquidity of the company.\n 4. Primarily represents remaining minimum payments under DuPont Pioneer license agreements. \n \u2022 Ability to discover, develop and protect new technologies and enforce the company's intellectual property rights; and \nIn determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:\nThe $476 million in charges recorded during 2014 in employee separation / asset related charges, net related to the 2014 global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions. DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2014, a pre-tax charge of $541 million was recorded, consisting of $476 million in employee separation / asset related charges, net and $65 million in other income, net. The charges consisted of $301 million severance and related benefit costs, $17 million of other non-personnel costs, and $223 million of asset related costs, including $65 million of costs associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. The actions associated with this charge and all related payments are substantially complete.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nThe company has access to approximately $4.9 billion in unused credit lines, which includes a $4 billion revolving credit facility to support its commercial paper program, with several major financial institutions. These unused credit lines provide additional support to meet short-term liquidity needs and general corporate purposes including letters of credit.\nDivestiture of Performance Coatings In August 2012, the company entered into a definitive agreement with Flash Bermuda Co. Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited liability company formed by affiliates of The Carlyle Group (collectively referred to as \"Carlyle\") in which Carlyle agreed to purchase certain subsidiaries and assets comprising the company's Performance Coatings business. In February 2013, the sale was completed resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax). The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn 2015, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $0.7 billion, reflecting a $0.5 billion decrease from 2014. The decrease was largely due to the impact associated with the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations, the absence of 2014 gains on sales of businesses and other assets in the Performance Materials and Agriculture segments, as well as increased tax benefits on employee separation/asset related charges.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nLong-term Employee Benefits\n\nAt the international level, significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace, highlighting the need for coordinated global policy actions. An effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology, while maintaining open and competitive global markets.\n2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased primarily due to cost reductions and continued productivity improvements, partially offset by lower sales.\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.\nPre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations are summarized below:\nIndemnification Assets\nOn December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs compared to 2015. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2015, a pre-tax charge of $798 million was recorded, consisting of $793 million of employee separation / asset related charges, net and $5 million in other income, net. The charges consisted of $656 million in severance and related benefit costs, $109 million in asset related charges, and $33 million in contract termination charges. Future cash expenditures related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $680 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits. The restructuring actions associated with this charge are expected to impact approximately 10 percent of DuPont's workforce and to be substantially complete in 2016.\n\nPart II\n\nThe $112 million in charges recorded during 2013 in employee separation / asset related charges, net consisted of a net $17 million restructuring benefit and a $129 million asset impairment charge discussed below. The net $17 million restructuring benefit consisted of a $26 million benefit associated with prior year restructuring programs offset by a $9 million charge resulting from restructuring actions related to a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. The majority of the $26 million benefit was due to the achievement of work force reductions through non-severance programs associated with the 2012 restructuring program.\n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $1.6 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The company expects 2016 purchases of property, plant and equipment to about $1.1 billion.\n\n2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased due primarily to increased automotive demand, partially offset by the portfolio impact of the sale of GLS/Vinyls.\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nIn 2016, the company expects to contribute about the same as 2015 for pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, its remaining plans with no plan assets and its other long-term employee benefit plans.\nPERFORMANCE MATERIALS\nIn the first quarter 2015, DuPont announced its intention to buy back shares of about $4 billion using the distribution proceeds received from Chemours. In connection with the completion of the spin-off of Chemours, the Board of Directors authorized the use of the distribution proceeds to buy back shares of the company's common stock as follows: $2 billion to be purchased and retired by December 31, 2015 with the remainder to be purchased and retired by December 31, 2016. In August 2015, the company entered an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. Under the terms of the August 2015 ASR agreement, the company paid $2 billion to the financial institution and received and retired 35 million shares at an average price of $57.16 per share. See Part I, Item 5 Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe company is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. Such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate.\nPart II\nPart II\nU.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $144 million to its unfunded plans in 2015.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\n\n \u2022 Successful integration of acquired businesses and separation of underperforming or non-strategic assets or businesses. \nPart II\nPart II\nBased on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test, completed in the third quarter 2015, we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The company's methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units is using the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction analyses. There can be no assurance that the company's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow and revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate.\n2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased from higher volumes and improved product mix as discussed above.\nPart II\nAssessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets, investments in affiliates and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nCash used for investing activities in 2015 increased by $1.5 billion compared to 2014. The change was primarily due to lower proceeds received from the sale of businesses in 2015 compared to 2014 and increase purchases of marketable securities in 2015 compared to 2014. This was partially offset by lower purchases of property, plant and equipment, mainly due to the absence of Chemours in the second half of 2015 which accounted for $0.3 billion. See Note 20 for further discussion of marketable securities outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nThe company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings are as follows:\nRedesign Initiative and 2014 Restructuring Plan In June 2014, DuPont announced its global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to reduce costs and improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions. DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 pre-tax (benefits) charges of $(21) million and $541 million, respectively, were recorded. Cost reductions from the 2014 operational redesign are essentially complete and for full year 2015, the company delivered incremental cost savings of approximately $0.40 per share year over year. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe above charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2015 is due to a curtailment gain partially offset by a decrease in discount rate. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2014 is primarily related to higher discount rates and better than expected pension asset returns. See \"Long-term Employee Benefits\" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 40 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.\nFunding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $164 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan in 2015.\n\n\nSeparation of Performance Chemicals In October 2013, DuPont announced its intention to separate its Performance Chemicals segment through a U.S. tax-free spin-off to shareholders, subject to customary closing conditions. In July 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (Chemours).\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $1.4 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the absence of Chemours in the second half of 2015 compared with a full year of results in 2014 for an impact of approximately $1.0 billion and a lower cash earnings contribution from continuing operations of approximately $0.3 billion.\nStrategy DuPont's near term focus is to deliver earnings growth while positioning the businesses to compete successfully over the long term; continue to improve capital allocation and working capital performance; and complete the proposed merger of equals with Dow.\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $1.2 billion decreased 6 percent, primarily due to the negative impact of currency, lower prices and demand for biomaterials, partially offset by volume growth in enzymes, principally for home and personal care, food markets and ethanol production.\n2015 operating earnings decreased $68 million, or 9 percent, as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by the negative impact of currency of $53 million and lower sales. 2015 operating earnings margin was flat from prior year as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were offset by lower sales.\nEnvironmental Capital Expenditures\nOutlook Full year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be down in the low-single digits percent and full year operating earnings are expected to be down about 10 percent as volume growth will be more than offset by lower ethylene price and the negative impact of currency.\n2014 operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower corn seed volumes and the negative impact of currency which were partially offset by higher crop protection volumes, lower performance-based compensation expense of approximately $110 million, higher local seed prices and lower seed input costs. Operating earnings margin was about the same in each period.\nRemediation Accrual\nPart II\nLegal Contingencies\nAdditional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under \"Long-term Employee Benefits\" beginning on page 45 and in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPart II\nThe company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. Expanding upon significant global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2010, as of 2014 the company reduced its environmental footprint, achieving reductions of 9 percent in GHG emissions intensity and 8 percent in water consumption versus a 2010 baseline. In addition, as of 2014, the company achieved an 11 percent reduction in energy intensity from non-renewable resources versus a 2010 baseline. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy.\nFull year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be down mid-single digits percent and full year operating earnings are expected to be about flat as local price gains and cost actions are offset by currency headwinds and lower volumes.\nForward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be accurate or realized. Forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control. Some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements are:\n\nAbout 80 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S. the discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plan's actuary as of the measurement date. For non-U.S. benefit plans, the company utilizes prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date.\n2015 operating earnings decreased as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by the negative impact of currency of $132 million and lower selling prices. 2015 operating earnings includes $49 million of benefits, comprised of a net benefit from a joint venture, the sale of a business and the realization of tax benefits associated with a manufacturing site. Operating earnings margin increased due primarily to cost reductions and continued productivity improvements.\nThe company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2016, long term employee benefits expense from continuing operations is expected to decrease by about $230 million due to the adoption of the full yield curve approach and a higher discount rate which will be partially offset by a lower expected return on plan assets for the US pension plan from 8.5% to 8.0%. The adoption of the full yield curve approach will reduce 2016 expense by $210 million as a result of a $10 million and $200 million reduction in service and interest cost components, respectively. The estimated 2016 long term employee benefit expense from continuing operations does not include the impact of any settlement losses or curtailment gains resulting from actions associated with the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring program, as it cannot be estimated at this time.\nThe company's other long-term employee benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $237 million, $233 million and $207 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.\nThe $71 million decrease in 2014 was due to lower average borrowings as average interest rates were essentially unchanged in each year.\n2015 versus 2014 The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2015 consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from prior year:\n \u2022 Failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; \nThe company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are $6.2 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. of $4.2 billion and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are generally utilized to fund local operating activities and capital expenditure requirements and are expected to support non-U.S. liquidity needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. The company expects domestic liquidity needs, for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter, will be met through existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. and the various sources of liquidity discussed above. Therefore, the company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic liquidity to support its assumption that undistributed earnings at December 31, 2015 can be considered reinvested indefinitely.\nThe company changed the method it used to estimate the 2016 service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. benefit plans. For these plans, the company has historically estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve and cash flow for measurement of the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The company will utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these 2016 components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The company made this change as it believes it is a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The company considers this a change in estimate, and, accordingly, will account for it prospectively starting in 2016. This change does not affect the measure of the total benefit obligation. See information with the respect to the impact of the change in method on 2016 pension expense under \"Long-term Employee Benefits\" beginning on page 45.\nIn February 2016, in line with seasonal agricultural working capital requirements, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase agreement of up to $1 billion (the repurchase facility) that expires on November 30, 2016. Under the facility, the company may sell a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables within the Agriculture segment to participating institutions and simultaneously agree to repurchase at a future date. See further discussion of this facility in Item 9B, Other Information and Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that net reductions to the company's global unrecognized tax benefits could be in the range of $225 million to $250 million within the next 12 months with the majority due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions with various tax authorities.\nFree cash flow is a measurement not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, and therefore indicates operating cash flow available for payment of dividends, other investing activities and other financing activities. Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process.\n\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee the discussion entitled Dow DuPont Merger of Equals under Part 1, Item 1 Business of this report, Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details and a discussion of some of the risks related to the transaction.\nAs a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\n2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements and volume gains were mostly offset by the negative impact from currency of $53 million and the absence of the prior year $18 million gain from the termination of a distribution agreement.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 Impact of business disruptions, including supply disruptions, and security threats, regardless of cause, including acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, terrorism or war, natural disasters and weather events and patterns which could affect demand as well as availability of product, particularly in the Agriculture segment; \n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nOutlook Full year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be up by the low single digits percent with volume growth partially offset by the negative impact of currency. Full year operating earnings are expected to be up by the mid teens percent, on cost reductions and productivity improvements, leading to operating margin expansion for the year.\nNet sales of $25.1 billion were down 12 percent versus prior year reflecting a 7 percent negative impact from weaker currencies, particularly the Brazilian Real and the European Euro, 3 percent lower volume and a 2 percent negative impact from the absence of sales from divested businesses. Lower volume principally reflects a 6 percent decline in Agriculture that was primarily driven by lower seed volume and reduced demand for insect control products in Latin America, and a 7 percent decline in volumes for Electronics & Communications, primarily driven by competitive pressures impacting sales of Solamet\u00ae paste. These declines more than offset volume growth for Performance Materials, Nutrition & Health, and Industrial Biosciences. Portfolio and other reflects the impact of the prior year sales of Glass Laminating Solutions/Vinyls within the Performance Materials segment and Sontara\u00ae within the Safety & Protection segment. The impact from local prices and product mix was about even with prior year as 3 percent higher Agriculture prices were offset primarily by lower prices in Performance Materials and Electronics & Communications. Net sales in developing markets were $8.2 billion, 33 percent of total company net sales versus 34 percent in 2014, representing a slight decline principally due to lower Agriculture volume in Latin America. Developing markets include China, India, countries located in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and South East Asia.\n\nAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.\nThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future.\nNet sales of $28.4 billion were 2 percent below prior year including a 1 percent reduction from portfolio changes, primarily in the Performance Materials Segment, and a 1 percent negative currency impact reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Local prices were flat as 1 percent higher Agriculture prices were offset by lower prices in Electronics & Communication, primarily from lower metals prices. In developing markets, sales declined 1 percent to $9.7 billion. Sales in developing markets represented 34 percent of total company sales in 2014 and 2013.\n 1. Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). \nPart II\nPart II\n\n\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $3.3 billion decreased 8 percent, primarily due to the negative impact of currency. Volume growth in probiotics, ingredient systems, texturants and cultures was partially offset by lower volumes in specialty proteins due to competitive challenges.\n\nCertain Guarantee Contracts\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters, included in the liability of $492 million, that have an estimated liability of $291 million as of December 31, 2015 and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately $610 million above the amount accrued. As such, the company has recorded an indemnification asset of $291 million corresponding to the company's accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 Failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues; \n2014 versus 2013 COGS decreased 4 percent to $17.0 billion and decreased as a percentage of sales by 1 percent, principally due to portfolio changes, lower pension and OPEB costs and lower costs for metals and other raw materials.\nPart II\nThe company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt maturities and other cash needs and that its current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings continue to provide access as needed to the capital markets. While the company expects that capacity for its commercial paper could be reduced as a result of its current short-term credit ratings, the company's liquidity needs can continue to be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing, committed receivable repurchase facilities and asset sales.\nPart II\n 3. Includes raw material obligations related to supply agreements with Koch Industries, Inc. (INVISTA). \n2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $11.3 billion decreased $0.4 billion, or 4 percent, primarily due to lower corn seed volumes in Brazil and North America and the negative impact of currency, which was partly offset by an increase in crop protection volumes and higher local corn seed prices. In Brazil, corn seed market share and price were lower reflecting the impact of fall armyworm resistance and a reduction in planted hectares of corn. Higher volumes in insecticides were driven by continued growth in Rynaxypyr\u00ae insecticide and from successful launches of Cyazypyr\u00ae insecticide and new seed treatments in several markets.\n2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements more than offset lower sales.\nFor plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets.\nThe company is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth.\nDuPont Dow Merger of Equals On December 11, 2015, DuPont and Dow announced entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals. The merger transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approvals by both DuPont and Dow shareholders. The combined company will be named DowDuPont.\nThe $3.3 billion decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2015 was primarily due to the distribution of Chemours borrowings to the company as part of the separation, partially offset by a reduction in short term borrowings, and an increase in the repurchase of common stock.\nPart II\n 7. Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other long-term employee benefits. \n2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased from improved product mix, volume growth, productivity improvements and a gain of $18 million from the termination of a distribution agreement, partially offset by the negative impact from currency.\nPart II\nIncome Taxes\nThe goal is to increase agility and responsiveness to market conditions, a necessity to win in a globally competitive environment, and drive growth across three strategic priorities: extending leadership in agriculture and nutrition, strengthening and growing advanced materials capabilities, and leveraging science to develop a world leading bio-based industrial business.\nDuPont and Dow intend to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the board of directors of DowDuPont, the separation of the combined company's agriculture business, specialty products business and material science business through a series of one or more tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the Business Separations.)\nOutlook In 2016 the company expects the photovoltaic market to remain strong with module installations forecasted to increase mid-teens percent driving strong growth in Tedlar\u00ae film in photovoltaics. Segment results are expected to continue to be negatively impacted by declines in Solamet\u00ae paste with the impact lessening in the second half of the year due to more favorable year-over-year comparisons and expected new product introductions. The company anticipates consumer electronics markets will have a weaker start to the year but strengthen in the second half as channel inventories are worked off.\nFor the first half of 2016, which reflects the majority of the northern hemisphere season, the company expects Agriculture sales to be mid-single digits percent lower with operating earnings in the low-teens percent below 2015 as local price gains and the benefit of cost actions are more than offset by lower insecticide and soybean volumes and currency. Crop protection's volume forecast assumes a continued impact from the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility. Volumes will be more challenged in the first quarter, due to the strong start in North America corn seed which benefited the fourth quarter of 2015, and due to crop protection in Brazil.\n\nDuring 2015, the company recorded an impairment charge of $38 million in the Other segment, the majority relating to an impairment of a cost basis investment.\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the distribution. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these indemnified matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the Separation Agreement and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as solvency of Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable.\nPart II\nWithin the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plans' assets.", "item_7_text": "2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $1.2 billion increased 3 percent, primarily due to increased enzyme demand, principally for ethanol production, food and animal nutrition, driven by new product offerings. In 2014, ethanol industry fundamentals were adjusting to a lower energy cost environment but demand for the company's novel enzymes and other functional bio products designed to increase production rates, yield and efficiency remained steady.\n\nAGRICULTURE\n2015 versus 2014 The $580 million decrease was primarily due to the absence of prior year gains on sales of businesses and other assets, including a $391 million gain on the sale of GLS/Vinyls, within the Performance Materials segment, and a $240 million gain on the sale of copper fungicides and land management businesses, both within the Agriculture segment, partially offset by gains on sales of businesses and assets in 2015, primarily in the Agriculture and Performance Materials segments. In addition, pre-tax exchange gains decreased $166 million compared to prior year driven by lower gains on foreign currency exchange contracts. See Note 5 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by $145 million gain associated with the company's settlement of a legal claim related to the Safety & Protection segment and $85 million increase in equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to the absence of $65 million for charges associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment recorded in 2014.\nDuPont Sustainable Solutions, within the company's Safety & Protection segment, is comprised of two business units: clean technologies and consulting solutions. Effective January 1, 2016, the clean technologies business unit will become part of the Industrial Biosciences segment with the focus on working with customers to improve the performance, productivity and sustainability of their products and processes. The company will explore a range of options to maximize the growth of the consulting solutions business unit which effective January 1, 2016 will be reported within Other. Sustainable solutions net sales accounted for about 2 percent of the company's total consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Segment results and 2016 segment outlook information are not reflective of the 2016 reporting change.\nThe company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as other long-term employee benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:\nAbout 75 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2015 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\n 1. Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nClimate Change\nEnvironmental Operating Costs\nFull year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be about flat as strong volume growth in Tedlar\u00ae film for photovoltaics is offset by lower sales of Solamet\u00ae paste and lower metals pricing. Full year operating earnings are expected to be in the low-twenty percent range higher from increased volume and cost reductions and continued productivity improvements.\nDividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.7 billion in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.72, $1.84, and $1.78 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In January 2016, the Board of Directors declared a first quarter common stock dividend of $0.38 per share. With the first quarter 2016 dividend, the company has paid quarterly consecutive dividends since the company's first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904.\nITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nThe $3.6 billion increase in cash used for financing activities in 2014 was primarily due to lower borrowings and higher payments for the repurchase of common stock.\nThe $35 million decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower average borrowings partially offset by slightly higher average interest rates compared to prior year.\nResults Net sales of $25.1 billion, were down 12 percent versus prior year, principally reflecting 7 percent negative impact from currency, 3 percent lower volume and 2 percent negative impact from portfolio changes. Income from continuing operations after income taxes declined from $3.1 billion to $1.9 billion, reflecting lower segment operating earnings, the absence of prior year gains on businesses and other assets, and higher restructuring charges, partially offset by costs savings associated with the 2014 redesign initiative and restructuring plan. Total pre-tax segment operating earnings of $4.2 billion, were 16 percent below last year, principally due to the negative impact of currency of about $785 million and lower volumes driven by weakness in agriculture markets, partially offset by costs savings associated with the 2014 operational redesign initiative and restructuring plan.\nCorporate Outlook\n \u2022 Outcome of significant litigation and environmental matters, including those related to divested businesses, including realization of associated indemnification assets, if any; \nAt December 31, 2015, the company had a deferred tax asset balance of $3.4 billion, net of valuation allowance of $1.5 billion. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets.

Full year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be down low-single digits percent as volume growth, driven by investments in probiotics and cultures, is more than offset by the negative impact of currency. Full year operating earnings are expected to be up high-teens percent benefiting from cost reductions and productivity improvements, further expanding operating margins.\nPart II\n 8. Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the timing of certain payments of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $3.5 billion decreased $0.4 billion, or 9 percent, primarily due to the negative impact of currency, the portfolio impact of the Sontara\u00ae divestiture, and lower volume. Decreased demand for Sustainable Solution offerings, Nomex\u00ae thermal resistant fiber and Kevlar\u00ae high strength materials was driven by a weakened oil and gas industry and military spending delays, partially offset by volume growth for Tyvek\u00ae protective material, including medical packaging.\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $9.8 billion decreased $1.5 billion, or 13 percent, primarily due to the negative impact of currency and lower seed and crop protection volumes, primarily in Brazil and North America, which were partly offset by higher local corn seed prices. In Brazil, lower corn seed volume reflects the impact of a reduction in summer planted hectares of corn and fall armyworm resistance impacting performance of certain corn hybrids. In North America, lower soybean volume reflects between 1 and 2 points of share loss and lower soybean planted area; lower corn planted area was partially offset by higher local corn seed prices. Lower crop protection volume is primarily due to low expected insect pressure, the adoption of insect protected soybean varieties, higher inventories, and a challenging macro environment. Insect control volumes were also impacted by the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility in Texas.\nDuPont's objective continues to be to complete the remaining $2 billion stock buyback by year end December 31, 2016. However, as a result of the planned merger of equals with Dow, the company expects it will have limited opportunities to enter the market prior to the shareholder vote on the merger. After the vote, the company plans to make repurchases.\n2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $6.1 billion decreased $0.1 billion, or 2 percent, due primarily to the impact of the sale of GLS/Vinyls and decreased ethylene volumes as a result of the second quarter scheduled outage at the Orange, Texas ethylene unit. This was partially offset by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China, Europe and North America.\n\n2014 versus 2013 The $79 million decrease was primarily attributable to lower pension and OPEB costs and lower spending for Agriculture and Electronic & Communications programs.\nCash used for investing activities in 2014 decreased $3.3 billion compared to 2013. The change was primarily due to lower proceeds received from the sale of businesses in 2014 compared to 2013.\n \u2022 Ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for its products especially in the Agriculture segment; \nPart II\nDeferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material.\n\nSee Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the the Imprelis\u00ae matter.\nPart II\n\n 2. Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement. \n2015 versus 2014 Cost of goods sold (COGS) decreased $1.9 billion, or 11 percent, principally reflecting declines from currency due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar verses global currencies, productivity improvements, impacts of portfolio changes, lower volume and lower raw material costs. COGS as a percent of sales was unchanged from prior year at 60 percent as the benefit of productivity improvements offset the negative impact of currency which decreased sales by 7 percent and COGS by 4 percent.\n2014 versus 2013 The $451 million decrease was largely attributable to lower pension and OPEB costs and lower sales commissions within the Agriculture segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 1 percent, primarily due to lower pension and OPEB costs.\nPart II\nOutlook Full year 2016 segment net sales are expected to increase in the low-single digits percent, driven by volume improvement, pricing and the impact of new product introductions in bioactives, including increased penetration in food markets. Full year operating earnings are expected to be about flat, reflecting cost savings and productivity improvements offset by higher product costs and currency.\n\nIn October 2014, the Society of Actuaries released final reports of new mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale for measurement of retirement program obligations in the U.S. The company adopted these tables in measuring the 2014 long-term employee benefit obligations. This adoption increased the benefit obligation at December 31, 2014 by approximately $1.7 billion. The effect of this adoption was amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2015. In October 2015, the Society of Actuaries released an updated mortality improvement scale reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the October 2014 release. This release was adopted by the company in measuring the 2015 long-term employee benefit obligations in the U.S. This adoption decreased the benefit obligation at December 31, 2015 by approximately $0.4 billion. The effect of this adoption will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2016.\n\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nIn January 2014, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan. In February and August 2014, the company entered into two separate ASR agreements. The February 2014 ASR agreement was completed in the second quarter of 2014, under which the company purchased and retired 15.1 million shares for $1 billion. The August 2014 ASR agreement was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, under which the company purchased and retired 10.4 million shares for $700 million. In addition to the ASR agreements, in 2014, the company repurchased and retired 4.7 million shares in the open market for a total cost of $300 million. In 2015, the company repurchased and retired 4.6 million shares in the open market for a total cost of $353 million. As a result, the company has completed $2.4 billion of repurchases as of December 31, 2015. The remainder of the $5 billion share buyback will be purchased in future periods as there is no required completion date for purchases under the 2014 plan.\nThe company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations.\nNUTRITION & HEALTH\n \u2022 Risks related to the agreement between DuPont and Dow to effect an all-stock merger of equals, including the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, the ability to fully and timely realize the expected benefits of the proposed transaction and risks related to the intended business separations contemplated to occur after the completion of the proposed transaction; \n2015 versus 2014 The $60 million decrease was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus global currencies, cost savings from the company's operational redesign initiative, partially offset by higher pension and OPEB costs. Research and development expense as a percent of sales increased due to lower sales.\n \u2022 Failure to appropriately respond to market acceptance, government rules, regulations and policies affecting products based on biotechnology; \n\n\nINDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES\n\n \u2022 Effect of changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations or political conditions in the United States of America (U.S.) and other countries in which the company operates; \nPart II\n2014 versus 2013 The $906 million increase was primarily due to $710 million of gains on sales of businesses and other assets, including a $391 million gain on the sale of GLS/Vinyls, within the Performance Materials segment, and a $240 million gain on the sale of copper fungicides and land management businesses, both within the Agriculture segment. There were additional net exchange gains of $297 million, partially offset by $65 million for charges associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment and the absence of the $26 million re-measurement gain on equity method investment in 2013.\n2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased, due primarily to the above mentioned increase in volumes, productivity improvements and lower product costs, partially offset by lower sales from clean technologies offerings, a negative currency impact, and the portfolio impact of the Sontara\u00ae divestiture.\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\nPursuant to its cash discipline policy, the company seeks first to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. The company continually reviews its sources of liquidity and debt portfolio and occasionally may make adjustments to one or both to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum debt maturity schedule.\nPart II\nITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nIn December 2012, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share buyback plan. In 2013, the company entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution under which the company used $1 billion of the proceeds from the sale of Performance Coatings for the purchase and retirement 20.4 million shares of common stock.\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $5.3 billion decreased $0.8 billion, or 12 percent, primarily due to the negative impact of currency, lower ethylene pricing and the portfolio impact of the sale of Glass Laminating Solutions/Vinyls (GLS/Vinyls) in June 2014 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Partially offsetting the declines are increased ethylene volumes due to the prior year scheduled outage at the ethylene unit in Orange, Texas and increased demand for Performance Polymers offerings in automotive markets, primarily in the U.S. and Europe in the second half of 2015.\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $2.1 billion decreased $0.3 billion, or 13 percent, primarily due to competitive pressures impacting Solamet\u00ae paste and lower pricing from the pass-through of lower metals prices and the negative impact of currency, partially offset by volume growth in Tedlar\u00ae film photovoltaics and products for the consumer electronics market.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nIn 2014, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $1.2 billion, reflecting a $0.8 billion increase from 2013, largely due to the impact associated with the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary\nPart II\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements.\nITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nIn 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a phased-in scheme to regulate GHG emissions first from large stationary sources under the existing CAA permitting requirements administered by state and local authorities. Large capital investments may be required to install Best Available Control Technology on major new or modified sources of GHG emissions. In 2015, the EPA promulgated regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from new and reconstructed/modified Electric Generating Units (EGU's). In 2015, the EPA also promulgated new regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from existing EGUs that would be based on individual state emission reduction programs. These regulations are currently being challenged in the U.S. federal court. If the regulations survive these challenges, they may affect the long term price and supply of electricity and natural gas and demand for products that contribute to energy efficiency and renewable energy. The precise impact of the aforementioned regulations is uncertain due to the flexibility provided to the states in developing their programs and anticipated legal challenges to this regulatory approach. A comprehensive national policy that addresses climate change by relying on market-based mechanisms to drive reductions in greenhouse gases is likely to be more economically efficient than the facility-by-facility controls that would result from implementation of recently promulgated rules under EPA's existing authorities.\n 1. The long-term employee benefit plan charges include discontinued operations of $(245), $96 and $113 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nIncome from continuing operations after income taxes for 2015 was $1.9 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2014 and $2.2 billion in 2013. The changes between periods were due to the reasons noted above.\n2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $3.9 billion were essentially equal to prior year, as increased demand for Nomex\u00ae thermal resistant fiber and Kevlar\u00ae high strength materials was offset by impact of portfolio changes and lower sales for clean technologies offerings.\n2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $3.5 billion increased 2 percent, as volume growth in specialty proteins, cultures and probiotics, was partially offset by a negative impact from currency.\n2016 Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Plan On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs in 2016 compared with 2015, which represents a reduction of operating costs on a run-rate basis of about $1.0 billion by end of 2016. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them. In connection with the restructuring actions, the company recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of $798 million in the fourth quarter 2015, comprised of $656 million of severance and related benefit costs, $109 million of asset related charges, and $33 million of contract termination costs. Future cash expenditures related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $680 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits. The restructuring actions associated with this charge are expected to impact approximately 10 percent of DuPont's workforce and to be substantially complete in 2016. The company anticipates additional charges could occur in relation to the restructuring actions, which it cannot reasonably estimate at this time.\nThe $810 million in charges recorded during 2015 in employee separation / asset related charges, net consist of a $793 million charge related to the 2016 restructuring plan discussed below, a $38 million impairment charge discussed below, partly offset by a $21 million net benefit related to the 2014 restructuring plan. The $21 million net benefit was recorded to adjust the estimated costs associated with the 2014 restructuring program due to lower than estimated individual severance costs and workforce reductions achieved through non-severance programs, offset by the identification of additional projects in certain segments.\nCash provided by operating activities increased $0.5 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower year over year income tax payments associated with the sale of businesses and higher insurance recoveries and lower claims payments related to Imprelis\u00ae (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\n\nIn the fourth quarter 2015, the company elected to defer further testing and deployment of a multi-year, phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. At December 31, 2015, the company has capitalized costs associated with the ERP system of approximately $435 million which have not yet been placed in service. It remains probable that the ERP system will be completed and placed in service.\n 5. Pension and other long-term employee benefit obligations have been excluded from the table above. Expected 2016 funding for the principal U.S. pension plan and non-U.S. plans with plan assets is disclosed below within Long Term Employee Benefits. Contributions beyond 2016 are expected to be made, however, the amount of contributions are dependent on the future economic environment, investment returns on pension trust assets, as well as rules and regulations of the respective country in which the plans operate. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets and other long-term employee benefits plans are paid from operating cash flows. The benefit payments for these plans are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of benefit payments are uncertain. The estimated benefit payments in 2016 for these plans are disclosed below within Long Term Employee Benefits. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. \nOutlook Farmer net returns for row crops continue to trend down as land and rent prices have lagged the transition on lower commodity prices as grain stocks remain at elevated levels. The company expects the economic environment in the agriculture sector to remain challenged with corn and soybean commodity prices at the low end of normal until demand accelerates or there is a disruption in global production. Volatile currency markets are expected to continue to present headwinds given the size of DuPont Agriculture's businesses in Europe and Latin America. As farmers look to relative economics between crop alternatives, the company expects a slight year over year increase in Brazil Safrinha and North America corn area, provided weather cooperates during planting. Pioneer's order book in North America suggests a modest improvement in corn demand at the expense of soybeans in a highly competitive seed market. In crop protection, continued weak demand for foliar-applied insecticides in Brazil and elevated distributor inventories will continue to present challenges.\nPart II\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nFor some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements, see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 10.\nassets and liabilities of its operations, gains on sales of businesses and other assets in the Performance Materials and Agriculture segments, and the impact of Imprelis\u00ae charges in 2013 versus additional insurance recoveries in 2014. These impacts were partially offset by increased tax benefits on employee separation/asset related charges. The higher effective tax rate principally reflects the impact of foreign exchange losses on net monetary assets for which no corresponding tax benefit is realized, in addition to the impact of the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation which is also nondeductible.\nAdditional information related to the company's other income, net is included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPart II\nConsiderable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $1.0 billion above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2015. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 100 sites for which DuPont does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at approximately 140 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 190 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in \"de minimis buyouts\" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at one new site during 2015 compared with three and five similar notices in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nChanges in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:\nDuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company has recorded a liability of $492 million as of December 31, 2015; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $1.0 billion above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2015.\nContractual Obligations\n2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin decreased primarily due to the negative impact of currency of $538 million, lower sales, and an approximately $120 million negative impact of the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility and the absence of prior year impacts from performance-based compensation adjustments, partially offset by cost reductions and continued productivity improvements.\nIn connection with the planned merger, the company incurred $10 million in transaction related costs, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nSegment Reviews\nPart II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nPart II\nAsset Impairments\nThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other long-term employee benefits). Approximately 80 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nSegment operating earnings is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes excluding significant pre-tax benefits (charges), non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and interest. Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs includes all of the components of net periodic benefit cost from continuing operations with the exception of the service cost component. Reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year classifications. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details related to significant pre-tax benefits (charges) excluded from segment operating earnings. All references to prices are on a U.S. dollar (USD) basis, including the impact of currency, unless otherwise noted.\n2015 versus 2014 The $276 million decrease was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus global currencies, cost savings from the company's operational redesign initiative, and lower selling and commission expense, mainly within the Agriculture segment, partially offset by an increase in pension and OPEB costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 1 percent, primarily due to lower sales and higher pension and OPEB costs.\nValuation of Assets\n\nCurrent difficult global economic conditions in agriculture and slower growth in emerging markets are expected to continue challenging the company's sales growth in 2016. The company expects headwinds from currency due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar which is expected to be most significant in the first half of 2016. Growth in emerging markets is expected to slow, leading to a shift in the company's earnings mix to higher tax jurisdictions. The company expects income from continuing operations in 2016 will benefit from $730 million reduction in costs as a result of the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. These cost reductions will be weighted toward the second half of 2016 reflecting implementation of specific actions during the first and second quarters. In addition, the company expects income from continuing operations in 2016 to be impacted by transaction related costs associated with the proposed merger with Dow. See additional information regarding 2016 outlook under \"Segment Reviews\" beginning on page 30.\n\n2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased due to volume growth and productivity improvements. These were partly offset by the absence of $20 million of OLED technology licensing income realized during 2013.\n \u2022 Conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, including economic factors such as inflation, deflation, fluctuation in currency rates, interest rates and commodity prices; \nBenefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. No contributions were made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2015 and the company expects to contribute $230 million to this plan in 2016.\n2014 versus 2013 Other operating charges decreased $577 million to $645 million, and decreased as a percentage of sales by 2 percent, principally due to the absence of prior year charges for Imprelis\u00ae herbicide claims and current year insurance recoveries.\nDuPont has dramatically refined its portfolio to focus investment in areas of significant opportunity and secular growth; enhanced its innovation platform to deliver substantial revenues from new products; increased focus on efficiency, cost discipline, and accountability; and expanded markets geographically. The company is better connecting its laboratories and the marketplace, and striving for faster, more effective execution in delivering innovative solutions for customers.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\n\nPart II\nThere are existing efforts to address GHG emissions at the national and regional levels. Several of the company's facilities in the European Union (EU) are regulated under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. China has begun pilot programs for carbon taxes and trading of GHG emissions in selected areas. The current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., where many company facilities are located, adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions, particularly those relating to long-term capital investments.\nFor further information relating to the change in cash provided by operating activities, see discussion above under cash provided by operating activities.\nThe majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.\n2015 versus 2014 Other operating charges decreased $186 million, or 29 percent, principally reflecting $130 million reduction in the estimated liability related to Imprelis\u00ae herbicide claims, cost savings from the company's operational redesign initiative partially offset by lower insurance recoveries year over year related to Imprelis\u00ae herbicide claims.\nThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThis report contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words like plans,\u201d expects,\u201d will,\u201d anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d intends,\u201d projects,\u201d estimates\u201d or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company's strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position, anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions, timing of anticipated benefits from restructuring actions, outcome of contingencies, such as litigation and environmental matters, expenditures, financial results, and timing of, as well as expected benefits, including synergies, from the proposed merger with The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) and intended post-merger separations, are forward-looking statements.\nThe following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015:\n2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $2.4 billion decreased $0.2 billion, or 6 percent, as volume growth in several product lines was more than offset by pass-through of lower metals prices and by competitive pressures impacting Solamet\u00ae paste.\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.\n 1. Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). \nInformation related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table:\n\n\nIn May 2015, Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) downgraded the company's long-term rating to A3 from A2, and the short-term rating to P-2 from P-1. In October 2015, Standard and Poor's Rating Services (Standard and Poor's) downgraded the company's long-term rating to A- from A, and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. In December 2015 following the announcement of the Merger Agreement with Dow, Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings placed the outlook on the company's long-term and the short-term rating on negative watch and Moody's placed the company on negative outlook.\nIn 2015, the company spent approximately $20 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be about $40 million in 2016. In the U.S., additional capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding estimates for future capital expenditures. However, management does not believe that the costs to comply with these requirements will have a material impact on the financial position or liquidity of the company.\n 4. Primarily represents remaining minimum payments under DuPont Pioneer license agreements. \n \u2022 Ability to discover, develop and protect new technologies and enforce the company's intellectual property rights; and \nIn determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:\nThe $476 million in charges recorded during 2014 in employee separation / asset related charges, net related to the 2014 global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions. DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2014, a pre-tax charge of $541 million was recorded, consisting of $476 million in employee separation / asset related charges, net and $65 million in other income, net. The charges consisted of $301 million severance and related benefit costs, $17 million of other non-personnel costs, and $223 million of asset related costs, including $65 million of costs associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. The actions associated with this charge and all related payments are substantially complete.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nThe company has access to approximately $4.9 billion in unused credit lines, which includes a $4 billion revolving credit facility to support its commercial paper program, with several major financial institutions. These unused credit lines provide additional support to meet short-term liquidity needs and general corporate purposes including letters of credit.\nDivestiture of Performance Coatings In August 2012, the company entered into a definitive agreement with Flash Bermuda Co. Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited liability company formed by affiliates of The Carlyle Group (collectively referred to as \"Carlyle\") in which Carlyle agreed to purchase certain subsidiaries and assets comprising the company's Performance Coatings business. In February 2013, the sale was completed resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax). The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn 2015, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $0.7 billion, reflecting a $0.5 billion decrease from 2014. The decrease was largely due to the impact associated with the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations, the absence of 2014 gains on sales of businesses and other assets in the Performance Materials and Agriculture segments, as well as increased tax benefits on employee separation/asset related charges.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nLong-term Employee Benefits\n\nAt the international level, significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace, highlighting the need for coordinated global policy actions. An effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology, while maintaining open and competitive global markets.\n2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased primarily due to cost reductions and continued productivity improvements, partially offset by lower sales.\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.\nPre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations are summarized below:\nIndemnification Assets\nOn December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs compared to 2015. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2015, a pre-tax charge of $798 million was recorded, consisting of $793 million of employee separation / asset related charges, net and $5 million in other income, net. The charges consisted of $656 million in severance and related benefit costs, $109 million in asset related charges, and $33 million in contract termination charges. Future cash expenditures related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $680 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits. The restructuring actions associated with this charge are expected to impact approximately 10 percent of DuPont's workforce and to be substantially complete in 2016.\n\nPart II\n\nThe $112 million in charges recorded during 2013 in employee separation / asset related charges, net consisted of a net $17 million restructuring benefit and a $129 million asset impairment charge discussed below. The net $17 million restructuring benefit consisted of a $26 million benefit associated with prior year restructuring programs offset by a $9 million charge resulting from restructuring actions related to a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. The majority of the $26 million benefit was due to the achievement of work force reductions through non-severance programs associated with the 2012 restructuring program.\n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $1.6 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The company expects 2016 purchases of property, plant and equipment to about $1.1 billion.\n\n2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased due primarily to increased automotive demand, partially offset by the portfolio impact of the sale of GLS/Vinyls.\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nIn 2016, the company expects to contribute about the same as 2015 for pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, its remaining plans with no plan assets and its other long-term employee benefit plans.\nPERFORMANCE MATERIALS\nIn the first quarter 2015, DuPont announced its intention to buy back shares of about $4 billion using the distribution proceeds received from Chemours. In connection with the completion of the spin-off of Chemours, the Board of Directors authorized the use of the distribution proceeds to buy back shares of the company's common stock as follows: $2 billion to be purchased and retired by December 31, 2015 with the remainder to be purchased and retired by December 31, 2016. In August 2015, the company entered an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. Under the terms of the August 2015 ASR agreement, the company paid $2 billion to the financial institution and received and retired 35 million shares at an average price of $57.16 per share. See Part I, Item 5 Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe company is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. Such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate.\nPart II\nPart II\nU.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $144 million to its unfunded plans in 2015.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\n\n \u2022 Successful integration of acquired businesses and separation of underperforming or non-strategic assets or businesses. \nPart II\nPart II\nBased on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test, completed in the third quarter 2015, we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The company's methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units is using the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction analyses. There can be no assurance that the company's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow and revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate.\n2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased from higher volumes and improved product mix as discussed above.\nPart II\nAssessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets, investments in affiliates and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nCash used for investing activities in 2015 increased by $1.5 billion compared to 2014. The change was primarily due to lower proceeds received from the sale of businesses in 2015 compared to 2014 and increase purchases of marketable securities in 2015 compared to 2014. This was partially offset by lower purchases of property, plant and equipment, mainly due to the absence of Chemours in the second half of 2015 which accounted for $0.3 billion. See Note 20 for further discussion of marketable securities outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nThe company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings are as follows:\nRedesign Initiative and 2014 Restructuring Plan In June 2014, DuPont announced its global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to reduce costs and improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions. DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 pre-tax (benefits) charges of $(21) million and $541 million, respectively, were recorded. Cost reductions from the 2014 operational redesign are essentially complete and for full year 2015, the company delivered incremental cost savings of approximately $0.40 per share year over year. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe above charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2015 is due to a curtailment gain partially offset by a decrease in discount rate. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2014 is primarily related to higher discount rates and better than expected pension asset returns. See \"Long-term Employee Benefits\" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 40 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.\nFunding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $164 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan in 2015.\n\n\nSeparation of Performance Chemicals In October 2013, DuPont announced its intention to separate its Performance Chemicals segment through a U.S. tax-free spin-off to shareholders, subject to customary closing conditions. In July 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (Chemours).\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $1.4 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the absence of Chemours in the second half of 2015 compared with a full year of results in 2014 for an impact of approximately $1.0 billion and a lower cash earnings contribution from continuing operations of approximately $0.3 billion.\nStrategy DuPont's near term focus is to deliver earnings growth while positioning the businesses to compete successfully over the long term; continue to improve capital allocation and working capital performance; and complete the proposed merger of equals with Dow.\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $1.2 billion decreased 6 percent, primarily due to the negative impact of currency, lower prices and demand for biomaterials, partially offset by volume growth in enzymes, principally for home and personal care, food markets and ethanol production.\n2015 operating earnings decreased $68 million, or 9 percent, as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by the negative impact of currency of $53 million and lower sales. 2015 operating earnings margin was flat from prior year as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were offset by lower sales.\nEnvironmental Capital Expenditures\nOutlook Full year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be down in the low-single digits percent and full year operating earnings are expected to be down about 10 percent as volume growth will be more than offset by lower ethylene price and the negative impact of currency.\n2014 operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower corn seed volumes and the negative impact of currency which were partially offset by higher crop protection volumes, lower performance-based compensation expense of approximately $110 million, higher local seed prices and lower seed input costs. Operating earnings margin was about the same in each period.\nRemediation Accrual\nPart II\nLegal Contingencies\nAdditional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under \"Long-term Employee Benefits\" beginning on page 45 and in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPart II\nThe company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. Expanding upon significant global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2010, as of 2014 the company reduced its environmental footprint, achieving reductions of 9 percent in GHG emissions intensity and 8 percent in water consumption versus a 2010 baseline. In addition, as of 2014, the company achieved an 11 percent reduction in energy intensity from non-renewable resources versus a 2010 baseline. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy.\nFull year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be down mid-single digits percent and full year operating earnings are expected to be about flat as local price gains and cost actions are offset by currency headwinds and lower volumes.\nForward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be accurate or realized. Forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control. Some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements are:\n\nAbout 80 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S. the discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plan's actuary as of the measurement date. For non-U.S. benefit plans, the company utilizes prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date.\n2015 operating earnings decreased as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by the negative impact of currency of $132 million and lower selling prices. 2015 operating earnings includes $49 million of benefits, comprised of a net benefit from a joint venture, the sale of a business and the realization of tax benefits associated with a manufacturing site. Operating earnings margin increased due primarily to cost reductions and continued productivity improvements.\nThe company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2016, long term employee benefits expense from continuing operations is expected to decrease by about $230 million due to the adoption of the full yield curve approach and a higher discount rate which will be partially offset by a lower expected return on plan assets for the US pension plan from 8.5% to 8.0%. The adoption of the full yield curve approach will reduce 2016 expense by $210 million as a result of a $10 million and $200 million reduction in service and interest cost components, respectively. The estimated 2016 long term employee benefit expense from continuing operations does not include the impact of any settlement losses or curtailment gains resulting from actions associated with the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring program, as it cannot be estimated at this time.\nThe company's other long-term employee benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $237 million, $233 million and $207 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.\nThe $71 million decrease in 2014 was due to lower average borrowings as average interest rates were essentially unchanged in each year.\n2015 versus 2014 The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2015 consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from prior year:\n \u2022 Failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; \nThe company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are $6.2 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. of $4.2 billion and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are generally utilized to fund local operating activities and capital expenditure requirements and are expected to support non-U.S. liquidity needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. The company expects domestic liquidity needs, for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter, will be met through existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. and the various sources of liquidity discussed above. Therefore, the company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic liquidity to support its assumption that undistributed earnings at December 31, 2015 can be considered reinvested indefinitely.\nThe company changed the method it used to estimate the 2016 service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. benefit plans. For these plans, the company has historically estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve and cash flow for measurement of the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The company will utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these 2016 components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The company made this change as it believes it is a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The company considers this a change in estimate, and, accordingly, will account for it prospectively starting in 2016. This change does not affect the measure of the total benefit obligation. See information with the respect to the impact of the change in method on 2016 pension expense under \"Long-term Employee Benefits\" beginning on page 45.\nIn February 2016, in line with seasonal agricultural working capital requirements, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase agreement of up to $1 billion (the repurchase facility) that expires on November 30, 2016. Under the facility, the company may sell a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables within the Agriculture segment to participating institutions and simultaneously agree to repurchase at a future date. See further discussion of this facility in Item 9B, Other Information and Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that net reductions to the company's global unrecognized tax benefits could be in the range of $225 million to $250 million within the next 12 months with the majority due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions with various tax authorities.\nFree cash flow is a measurement not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, and therefore indicates operating cash flow available for payment of dividends, other investing activities and other financing activities. Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process.\n\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee the discussion entitled Dow DuPont Merger of Equals under Part 1, Item 1 Business of this report, Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details and a discussion of some of the risks related to the transaction.\nAs a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\n2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements and volume gains were mostly offset by the negative impact from currency of $53 million and the absence of the prior year $18 million gain from the termination of a distribution agreement.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 Impact of business disruptions, including supply disruptions, and security threats, regardless of cause, including acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, terrorism or war, natural disasters and weather events and patterns which could affect demand as well as availability of product, particularly in the Agriculture segment; \n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued\nOutlook Full year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be up by the low single digits percent with volume growth partially offset by the negative impact of currency. Full year operating earnings are expected to be up by the mid teens percent, on cost reductions and productivity improvements, leading to operating margin expansion for the year.\nNet sales of $25.1 billion were down 12 percent versus prior year reflecting a 7 percent negative impact from weaker currencies, particularly the Brazilian Real and the European Euro, 3 percent lower volume and a 2 percent negative impact from the absence of sales from divested businesses. Lower volume principally reflects a 6 percent decline in Agriculture that was primarily driven by lower seed volume and reduced demand for insect control products in Latin America, and a 7 percent decline in volumes for Electronics & Communications, primarily driven by competitive pressures impacting sales of Solamet\u00ae paste. These declines more than offset volume growth for Performance Materials, Nutrition & Health, and Industrial Biosciences. Portfolio and other reflects the impact of the prior year sales of Glass Laminating Solutions/Vinyls within the Performance Materials segment and Sontara\u00ae within the Safety & Protection segment. The impact from local prices and product mix was about even with prior year as 3 percent higher Agriculture prices were offset primarily by lower prices in Performance Materials and Electronics & Communications. Net sales in developing markets were $8.2 billion, 33 percent of total company net sales versus 34 percent in 2014, representing a slight decline principally due to lower Agriculture volume in Latin America. Developing markets include China, India, countries located in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and South East Asia.\n\nAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.\nThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future.\nNet sales of $28.4 billion were 2 percent below prior year including a 1 percent reduction from portfolio changes, primarily in the Performance Materials Segment, and a 1 percent negative currency impact reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Local prices were flat as 1 percent higher Agriculture prices were offset by lower prices in Electronics & Communication, primarily from lower metals prices. In developing markets, sales declined 1 percent to $9.7 billion. Sales in developing markets represented 34 percent of total company sales in 2014 and 2013.\n 1. Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). \nPart II\nPart II\n\n\n2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $3.3 billion decreased 8 percent, primarily due to the negative impact of currency. Volume growth in probiotics, ingredient systems, texturants and cultures was partially offset by lower volumes in specialty proteins due to competitive challenges.\n\nCertain Guarantee Contracts\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters, included in the liability of $492 million, that have an estimated liability of $291 million as of December 31, 2015 and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately $610 million above the amount accrued. As such, the company has recorded an indemnification asset of $291 million corresponding to the company's accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 Failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues; \n2014 versus 2013 COGS decreased 4 percent to $17.0 billion and decreased as a percentage of sales by 1 percent, principally due to portfolio changes, lower pension and OPEB costs and lower costs for metals and other raw materials.\nPart II\nThe company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt maturities and other cash needs and that its current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings continue to provide access as needed to the capital markets. While the company expects that capacity for its commercial paper could be reduced as a result of its current short-term credit ratings, the company's liquidity needs can continue to be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing, committed receivable repurchase facilities and asset sales.\nPart II\n 3. Includes raw material obligations related to supply agreements with Koch Industries, Inc. (INVISTA). \n2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $11.3 billion decreased $0.4 billion, or 4 percent, primarily due to lower corn seed volumes in Brazil and North America and the negative impact of currency, which was partly offset by an increase in crop protection volumes and higher local corn seed prices. In Brazil, corn seed market share and price were lower reflecting the impact of fall armyworm resistance and a reduction in planted hectares of corn. Higher volumes in insecticides were driven by continued growth in Rynaxypyr\u00ae insecticide and from successful launches of Cyazypyr\u00ae insecticide and new seed treatments in several markets.\n2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements more than offset lower sales.\nFor plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets.\nThe company is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth.\nDuPont Dow Merger of Equals On December 11, 2015, DuPont and Dow announced entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals. The merger transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approvals by both DuPont and Dow shareholders. The combined company will be named DowDuPont.\nThe $3.3 billion decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2015 was primarily due to the distribution of Chemours borrowings to the company as part of the separation, partially offset by a reduction in short term borrowings, and an increase in the repurchase of common stock.\nPart II\n 7. Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other long-term employee benefits. \n2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased from improved product mix, volume growth, productivity improvements and a gain of $18 million from the termination of a distribution agreement, partially offset by the negative impact from currency.\nPart II\nIncome Taxes\nThe goal is to increase agility and responsiveness to market conditions, a necessity to win in a globally competitive environment, and drive growth across three strategic priorities: extending leadership in agriculture and nutrition, strengthening and growing advanced materials capabilities, and leveraging science to develop a world leading bio-based industrial business.\nDuPont and Dow intend to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the board of directors of DowDuPont, the separation of the combined company's agriculture business, specialty products business and material science business through a series of one or more tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the Business Separations.)\nOutlook In 2016 the company expects the photovoltaic market to remain strong with module installations forecasted to increase mid-teens percent driving strong growth in Tedlar\u00ae film in photovoltaics. Segment results are expected to continue to be negatively impacted by declines in Solamet\u00ae paste with the impact lessening in the second half of the year due to more favorable year-over-year comparisons and expected new product introductions. The company anticipates consumer electronics markets will have a weaker start to the year but strengthen in the second half as channel inventories are worked off.\nFor the first half of 2016, which reflects the majority of the northern hemisphere season, the company expects Agriculture sales to be mid-single digits percent lower with operating earnings in the low-teens percent below 2015 as local price gains and the benefit of cost actions are more than offset by lower insecticide and soybean volumes and currency. Crop protection's volume forecast assumes a continued impact from the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility. Volumes will be more challenged in the first quarter, due to the strong start in North America corn seed which benefited the fourth quarter of 2015, and due to crop protection in Brazil.\n\nDuring 2015, the company recorded an impairment charge of $38 million in the Other segment, the majority relating to an impairment of a cost basis investment.\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the distribution. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these indemnified matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the Separation Agreement and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as solvency of Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable.\nPart II\nWithin the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plans' assets.", "item_7_tables": "Table 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

This was due to negative currency impact, lower volumes, and portfolio changes. Agriculture and Electronics & Communications volumes declined significantly. \n\n- Income from continuing operations was $1.9 billion in 2015, down from $3.1 billion in 2014. This was due to lower segment operating earnings, absence of prior year gains, and higher restructuring charges.\n\n- A pre-tax restructuring charge of $798 million was recorded in Q4 2015 as part of a cost savings plan. This is expected to impact 10% of the workforce.\n\n- Cash flow from operations was $2.3 billion in 2015, down from $3.7 billion in 2014, primarily due to the absence of Chemours. \n\n- The company completed a $2 billion share repurchase program in 2015 using distribution proceeds from the Chemours spin-off. \n\n- In December 2015, DuPont announced a merger of equals with Dow which is expected to close in the second half of 2016.\n\n- For 2016, net sales are expected to be flat, with cost reductions of $730 million from restructuring. Income will also benefit from the Dow merger synergies."}
