Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this discussion to USD Partners, USDP, the Partnership, we, our, us or like terms used in the present tense or prospectively (periods beginning on or after October 15, 2014) refer to USD Partners LP and its subsidiaries.

Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this report.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by USD to acquire, develop and operate energy-related logistics assets, including rail terminals and other high-quality and complementary midstream infrastructure. Our principal assets consist of: (i) a crude oil origination terminal in Hardisty, Alberta, Canada, with capacity to load up to two 120-railcar unit trains per day, (ii) a crude oil terminal in Casper, Wyoming, with unit train-capable railcar loading capacity in excess of 100,000 barrels per day, or Bpd, and six customer-dedicated storage tanks with 900,000 barrels, or Bbls, of total capacity and (iii) two unit train-capable ethanol destination terminals in San Antonio, Texas, and West Colton, California. Our terminals provide critical infrastructure allowing our customers to transport energy-related products from multiple supply regions to numerous demand markets that are dependent on these products. In addition, we provide our customers with railcars and fleet services related to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail under multi-year, take-or-pay contracts. As of December 31, 2016, our railcar fleet consisted of 2,953 railcars, which we leased from various railcar manufacturers and financial entities, including 2,108 coiled and insulated, or C&I, railcars.\nWe generate substantially all of our operating cash flow from multi-year, take-or-pay contracts for crude oil terminalling services, such as railcar loading for transportation to end markets, storage and blending in on-site tanks, as well as related logistics services. We do not take ownership of the products that we handle nor do we receive any payments from our customers based on the value of such products. We believe rail will continue as an important transportation option for energy producers, refiners and marketers due to its unique advantages relative to other transportation means. Specifically, rail transportation of energy-related products provides flexible access to key demand centers on a relatively low fixed-cost basis with faster physical delivery, while preserving the specific quality of customer products over long distances.\nMarket Update\nSubstantially all of our operating cash flows are generated from take-or-pay contracts and, as a result, are not directly related to actual throughput volumes at our terminals. The volume of crude oil loaded at our Hardisty and Casper terminals is primarily influenced by the difference in price between Western Canadian Select, or WCS, and other grades of crude oil processed by refiners, commonly referred to as spreads, rather than absolute price levels. Spreads are influenced by, among other things, the availability of crude oil supplies relative to the level of demand from end users, such as refiners.\nIn mid-2016, wildfires in Alberta significantly interrupted production from nearby oil sands facilities. This meaningfully reduced crude oil supplies available to the market and effectively offset expected production growth for the year. As a result, WCS spreads remained narrow throughout 2016 as existing pipeline capacity largely met takeaway needs.\nWestern Canadian crude oil production is projected to increase throughout the next decade, driven primarily by developments in Alberta's oil sands region. In June 2016, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers projected that the supply of crude oil from Western Canada will grow by approximately 590,000 Bpd by 2020 and 890,000 Bpd by 2025 relative to 2015. Since then, several companies have announced plans to increase production capacity at their oil sands facilities, in part due to cost savings and optimization achieved during the recent commodity price downturn.\nFor example, Canadian Natural Resources recently announced plans to reinstate the development of the 40,000 Bpd Kirby North project and the evaluation of an opportunity to debottleneck the Horizon fractionation tower during upcoming turnaround work in order to increase production by 5,000 to 15,000 Bpd. Cenovus announced plans to resume construction on its 50,000 Bpd Christina Lake Phase G project and is advancing engineering work on two previously deferred expansion projects that total 75,000 Bpd of expected design capacity. MEG Energy announced an initiative at its Christina Lake Phase 2B project that is expected to increase production by approximately 20,000 Bpd. Consistent with these trends, our partner, Gibson Energy, recently commissioned ahead of schedule 2.9 million barrels of incremental storage capacity at the Hardisty hub, representing a nearly 50% increase. Gibson successfully secured short term contracts to utilize the tanks, as necessary, until the long-term take-or-pay contracts commence later in 2017.\nCertain end users, including refineries across North America, have made substantial investments in recent years in order to efficiently process heavy grades of crude oil, such as those from Western Canada. Even with recent regulatory approvals, additions to pipeline takeaway capacity are not expected to keep pace with production growth over the next several years. As a result, multiple industry forecasts project demand for rail takeaway solutions will increase in 2017 and 2018. Our Hardisty and Casper terminals, with established capacity and scalable designs, are well-positioned as strategic locations to meet expected future takeaway needs.\nWith additional volumes of crude oil handled at our Hardisty and Casper terminals, we expect to incur additional operating costs, including subcontracted rail services and pipeline fees.\nOur sponsor retained the right to develop certain expansions of our Hardisty terminal, which they are actively pursuing. These expansions may include solutions to transport heavier grades of crude oil produced in Western Canada, which our sponsor believes will maximize benefits to producers, refiners and railroads. Our sponsor is also currently in discussions with potential customers related to its proposed development of a marine terminal joint venture on the Houston Ship Channel. We anticipate that any solutions developed by our sponsor would be subject to the right of first offer in our favor contained in the omnibus agreement between us and USD.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nWe conduct our business through two distinct reporting segments: Terminalling services and Fleet services. We have established these reporting segments as strategic business units to facilitate the achievement of our long-term objectives, to assist in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance.\nTerminalling Services\nWe generate substantially all of our operating cash flow by charging fixed fees for handling energy-related products and providing related services. We do not take ownership of the underlying products that we handle nor do we receive any payments from our customers based on the value of such products. Thus, we have no direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices, although these risks could indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long term.\nHardisty Terminal Services Agreements. We have entered into terminal services agreements with seven high-quality, primarily investment grade counterparties or their subsidiaries: Cenovus Energy, Gibson, J. Aron & Company, Phillips 66, Suncor Energy, Total and USD Marketing LLC. Substantially all of the terminalling capacity at our Hardisty\nterminal is contracted under multi-year, take-or-pay terminal services agreements subject to inflation-based escalators with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 2.53 years as of December 31, 2016. Furthermore, approximately 83% of the contracted capacity at our Hardisty terminal is contracted with subsidiaries of five investment grade companies. All of our counterparties are obligated to pay a minimum monthly commitment fee and can load a maximum allotted number of unit trains or barrels per month. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its maximum allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit for up to six months. This credit may be used to offset fees on throughput volumes in excess of the customer's minimum monthly commitments in future periods to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We will receive a per-barrel fee on any volumes handled in excess of the customers' maximum allowed volume, to the extent the additional volume is not subject to the credit discussed above. If a force majeure event occurs, a customer's obligation to pay us may be suspended, in which case the length of the contract term will be extended by the same duration as the force majeure event.\nCasper Terminal Services Agreements. Our Casper terminal is supported by take-or-pay terminal services agreements with high quality, primarily investment grade refiners. The initial term of the agreements varies from three to five years, with extension or renewal options for one to three additional years, and a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 1.96 years as of December 31, 2016. Under these terminal services agreements, our customers are obligated to pay the greater of a minimum monthly commitment fee or a throughput fee based on the actual volume of crude oil loaded. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its maximum allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit which may be used to offset future throughput fees in excess of the minimum monthly commitment fees, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. Unused credits generally expire if not used by the end of each calendar quarter.\nEthanol Terminal Services Agreements. We have terminal services agreements with subsidiaries of an investment grade company for our San Antonio and West Colton terminals pursuant to which we are paid fixed fees per gallon of ethanol transloaded at each terminal. In August 2016, we received notification from the customer of our San Antonio terminal of their intent to terminate their terminalling services agreement with us, effective February 2017, which date was extended in January 2017 to May 1, 2017. In early February 2017, the lessor of the real property upon which the San Antonio terminal resides indicated their intent to terminate our lease with them concurrently with the conclusion of the extension agreement for terminalling services we have with our customer, at which time we expect to wind down the operations of this terminal. The agreement entitles the customer to 100% of the terminal's capacity, subject to our right to seek additional customers if minimum volume usage thresholds are not met. We expect to wind down the operations of our San Antonio terminal following the May 1, 2017, termination date as discussed in more detail below under General Trends and Outlook - San Antonio Terminal and in Note 7. Property and Equipment to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. The West Colton terminal services agreement has been in place since July 2009 and is terminable at any time by either party upon 150 days' notice. We are seeking permits to construct an approximately one-mile pipeline directly from our West Colton terminal to Kinder Morgan Inc.'s gasoline blending terminals, which, if approved and constructed, may result in long-term volume commitments and cash flows.\nFleet Services\nWe provide our customers with railcars and fleet services related to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail on a multi-year, take-or-pay basis under master fleet services agreements for periods ranging from five to nine years. We do not own any railcars. As of December 31, 2016, our railcar fleet consisted of 2,953 railcars, which we leased from various railcar manufacturers and financial entities, including 2,108 C&I railcars. We have assigned certain payment and performance obligations under the leases and master fleet service agreements for 2,613 of the railcars to other parties, but we have retained certain rights and obligations with respect to the servicing of these railcars. Approximately 84% of our current railcar fleet is dedicated to customers of our Hardisty terminal. The remaining 16% of our railcar fleet is dedicated to a customer of terminals belonging to subsidiaries previously sold by our predecessor. The master fleet services agreements we have with certain of our Hardisty terminal customers have a weighted-average remaining contract life of 4.6 years as of December 31, 2016. In the aggregate, our master fleet services agreements have a weighted-average remaining contract life of 4.1 years as of December 31, 2016.\nUnder the master fleet services agreements, we provide customers with railcar-specific fleet services, which may include, among other things, the provision of relevant administrative and billing services, the maintenance of railcars in accordance with standard industry practice and applicable laws, the management and tracking of the movement of railcars, the regulatory and administrative reporting and compliance as required in connection with the movement of railcars, and the negotiation for and sourcing of railcars. Our customers typically pay us and our assignees monthly fees per railcar for these services, which include a component for railcar use and a component for fleet services.\nHistorically, we contracted with railroads on behalf of some of our customers to arrange for the movement of railcars from our terminals to the destinations selected by our customers. We were the contracting party with the railroads for those shipments and were responsible to the railroads for the related fees charged by the railroads, for which we were reimbursed by our customers. Both the fees charged by the railroads to us and the reimbursement of these fees by our customers are included in our consolidated statements of operations in the revenues and operating costs line items entitled Freight and other reimbursables.\u201d\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to evaluate our operations. We consider these metrics to be significant factors in assessing our ability to generate cash and pay distributions and include: (i) Adjusted EBITDA and DCF; (ii) operating and maintenance expenses; and (iii) volumes. We define Adjusted EBITDA and DCF below.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" adjusted for changes in working capital items, changes in restricted cash, interest, income taxes, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, adjustments related to deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees and other items which do not affect the underlying cash flows produced by our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP, supplemental financial measure used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our liquidity and the ability of our business to produce sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe define Distributable Cash Flow, or DCF, as Adjusted EBITDA less net cash paid for interest, income taxes and maintenance capital expenditures. DCF does not reflect changes in working capital balances. DCF is a non-GAAP, supplemental financial measure used by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount of cash available for making distributions to our unitholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the excess cash flow being retained for use in enhancing our existing business; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the sustainability of our current distribution rate per unit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF in this report provides information that enhances an investor's understanding of our ability to generate cash for payment of distributions and other purposes. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and DCF is \"Net cash provided by operating activities\". Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered an alternative to \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" or any other measure of liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF exclude some, but not all, items that affect cash from operations and these measures may vary among other companies. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,085\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (deduct):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bad debt expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,424\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>(861\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(659\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,056\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(814\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in accounts receivable and other assets\n</td> <td>(1,859\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses\n</td> <td>1,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in deferred revenue and other liabilities\n</td> <td>996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,085\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,497\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in restricted cash\n</td> <td>654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(870\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>9,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>(759\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency transaction loss (gain) (1)\n</td> <td>(750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecovered reimbursable freight costs (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees (3)\n</td> <td>1,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>63,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (deduct):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid for income taxes (4)\n</td> <td>(845\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,995\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid for interest\n</td> <td>(8,722\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,695\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,588\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(238\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents foreign exchange transaction amounts associated with activities between our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents costs incurred associated with unrecovered reimbursable freight costs related to the initial delivery of railcars in support of the Hardisty terminal.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Represents deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees in excess of throughput utilized, which fees are not refundable to our customers.

Given that both our Hardisty and Casper terminals were constructed in 2014, we do not expect to incur significant maintenance expenditures in the near term to maintain the operating capacity of these facilities. We record routine maintenance expenses associated with operating our assets in \"Operating and maintenance\" costs in our consolidated statements of operations. Our operating and maintenance expenses are comprised primarily of pipeline fees, repairs and maintenance expenses, materials and supplies, subcontracted rail expenses, utility costs, insurance premiums and rent for facilities and equipment. In addition, our operating expenses include the cost of leasing railcars from third-party railcar suppliers and the shipping fees charged by railroads, which costs are generally passed through to our customers. Although our assets are relatively new, we expect to incur costs to maintain these assets in compliance with sound business practices, our contractual relationships and to comply with regulatory requirements for operating\nthese assets. We expect our expenses to remain relatively stable, but they may fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during a period and the timing of these expenditures.\nVolumes\nThe amount of Terminalling services revenue we generate depends on minimum customer commitment fees and the volume of crude oil that we handle at our terminals in excess of those minimum commitments, as well as the volume of biofuels transloaded at our ethanol terminals. These volumes are primarily affected by the supply of and demand for crude oil, refined products and biofuels in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Additionally, these volumes are affected by the spreads between the benchmark prices for these products, which are influenced by, among other things, the available takeaway capacity in those markets. Although customers at our Hardisty and Casper terminals have committed to minimum monthly fees under their terminal services agreements with us, which will generate the majority of our Terminalling services revenue, our results of operations will also be affected by:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our customers' utilization of our terminals in excess of their minimum monthly volume commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to identify and execute accretive acquisitions and commercialize organic expansion projects to capture incremental volumes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to renew contracts with existing customers, enter into contracts with new customers, increase customer commitments and throughput volumes at our terminals, and provide additional ancillary services at those terminals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nSan Antonio Terminal\nIn August 2016, we received notification from the customer of our San Antonio terminal stating their intent to terminate their terminalling services agreement with us in early February 2017, which was extended in January 2017 to early May 2017. In early February 2017, the lessor of the real property upon which the San Antonio terminal resides indicated their intent to terminate our lease with them concurrently with the conclusion of the extension agreement for terminalling services we have with our customer, at which time we expect to wind down the operations of this terminal. As a result we have recognized a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, including an asset retirement obligation of $1.0 million for amounts we expect to spend to restore the property to its original condition. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our San Antonio terminal contributed less than 3% of our Adjusted EBITDA. Except as indicated above, we do not expect the termination of this agreement to have a material impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe completed a study we commissioned in 2015 to evaluate the appropriate return attributable to the activities of our foreign subsidiaries, based upon the performance of risk management and other functions we provide. Based upon the results of this study, we adopted a methodology for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries and concluded the return initially attributed to the activities of our foreign subsidiaries exceeded the amounts considered to be reasonable based on the functions we provide on behalf of these subsidiaries. As a result, we determined that we had over-estimated our foreign income tax liability for 2015 by approximately $4.4 million, a majority of which was refunded to us prior to December 31, 2016. We received an additional refund of approximately $0.6 million (representing C$0.9 million) in February 2017 and do not expect any additional income tax refunds with respect to our 2015 Canadian income taxes.\nWe estimate our 2017 income tax provision to approximate C$5.7 million, based upon the current operations of our foreign subsidiaries. These estimates are subject to changes in the underlying operating activities and results of these foreign subsidiaries, as well as fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, among other factors.\nFactors That May Impact Future Results of Operations\nDemand for Rail Transportation of Crude Oil and Biofuels\nHigh-growth crude oil production areas in North America are often located at significant distances from refining centers, creating constantly evolving regional imbalances, which require the expedited development of flexible and sustainable transportation solutions. The extensive existing rail network, combined with rail transportation's relatively low capital and fixed costs compared to other transportation alternatives, has strategically positioned rail as a long-term transportation solution to growing and evolving energy infrastructure needs. In the event that additional pipeline capacity is constructed, or crude oil production decreases significantly, demand for transportation of crude oil by rail may be impacted.\nChanges in environmental and gasoline blending regulations may affect the use of ethanol in the market for transportation fuel. Due to corrosion concerns unique to biofuels, such as ethanol, the long-haul transportation of biofuels via multi-product pipelines is less efficient and less economical than rail. Rail also helps aggregate fragmented ethanol production across the country. In the event that dedicated pipelines are constructed, or additional technologies are developed to allow for more economical transportation of biofuels on multi-product pipelines, demand for transportation of biofuels by rail may be impacted.\nSupply and Demand for Crude Oil and Refined Products\nThe volume of crude oil and biofuels that we handle at our terminals and the number of railcars we provide and perform railcar-specific fleet services for ultimately depends on refining and blending margins. Refining and blending margins are dependent mostly upon the price of crude oil or other refinery feedstocks and the price of refined products. These prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including the global supply and demand for crude oil and gasoline and other refined products. The supply of crude oil will depend on numerous factors, including commodity pricing, improvements in extractive technology, environmental regulation and other factors. We believe that our Adjusted EBITDA and DCF will not be impacted in the near term to the extent of our multi-year, take-or-pay terminal services agreements. However, our ability to grow through expansion or acquisitions and our ability to renew or extend our terminal services agreements could be impacted by a long-term reduction in supply or demand.\nCustomer Contract Expirations and Renewals\nOur business is subject to the risk that we will not be able to renew, extend or replace our customer contracts as their terms expire. Each of the seven terminalling services agreements with our Hardisty terminal customers has an initial contract term of five years and expires in 2019. The initial term of six of these agreements commenced between June 30, 2014 and August 1, 2014, and the initial term of a seventh agreement commenced on October 1, 2014. The three terminalling services agreements with our Casper terminal customers have initial contract terms expiring in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Our sole customer contract for our San Antonio terminal has a term expiring in May 2017, and we anticipate that this customer will not renew or extend this contract further as it moves its business to a new wholly-owned terminal it is constructing. Our sole customer contract for our West Colton terminal is with the same customer at our San Antonio terminal and is terminable at any time by either party upon 150 days' notice.\nOne of the customers at our Casper terminal, whose terminalling services agreement with us represented approximately $12 million of our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, has a remaining term expiring in the third quarter of 2017, if not otherwise renewed or extended. This customer did not exercise its option to extend the agreement for an additional three-year term. We remain in active discussions with this customer, as well as other existing and potential new customers, for the provision of terminalling services by our Casper Terminal. We also are in active discussions with respect to the provision of terminalling services at our Hardisty terminal for periods following the terms of our existing agreements. Projected growth in Western Canada crude oil production, including recently announced additions to oil sands production capacity, represents a meaningful opportunity to meet upcoming takeaway needs with our strategically-positioned and scalable assets, particularly given current industry headwinds for new infrastructure projects. For a discussion of the risks associated with our ability to renew, extend or replace customer contracts, see Risk Factors - Our contracts subject us to renewal risks.\nDeferred Revenues Generated from Our Hardisty Operations\nUnder the terminal services agreements we have entered into with customers of our Hardisty terminal, our customers are obligated to pay the greater of a minimum monthly commitment fee or a throughput fee based on the actual volume of crude oil loaded at our Hardisty terminal. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its maximum allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit for up to six months to offset fees on throughput in excess of their minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We record the portion of customer payments in excess of amounts paid for volumes actually shipped as deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet. Lower throughput volumes do not affect our Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, or our ability to pay our minimum quarterly distribution, since such deferred revenues do not affect our cash flow. We typically recognize as revenue any amounts we have deferred within six months when these make-up rights\u201d are either used or expire. The utilization or expiration of make-up rights will not affect our cash flows since the fees associated with such volumes were previously collected. Additional discussion regarding make-up rights and deferred revenues is included in Note 10. Deferred Revenues to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.\nRegulatory Environment\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment, including laws and regulations that govern the handling of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels. Additionally, we are subject to regulations governing railcar design and evolving regulations pertaining to the shipment of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail. Please read Item 1. Business-Impact of Regulation. Similar to other industry participants, compliance with existing and any additional environmental laws and regulations could increase our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities, or the costs of our customers, which may reduce the attractiveness of rail transportation. Our master fleet services agreements generally obligate our customers to pay for modifications and other required repairs to our leased and managed railcar fleet. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully pass all such regulatory costs on to our customers. While changes in these laws and regulations could indirectly affect Adjusted EBITDA and DCF, we believe that consumers of our services place additional value on utilizing established and reputable third-party providers to satisfy their rail terminalling and logistics needs, which may allow us to increase market share relative to customer-owned operations or smaller operators that lack an established track record of safety and regulatory compliance.\nAcquisition Opportunities\nWe plan to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions that will provide attractive returns to our unitholders, including energy-related logistics assets related to the storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels, from both USD and third parties. We intend to leverage our industry relationships and market knowledge to successfully execute on such opportunities, which we may pursue independently or jointly with USD. We have entered into an omnibus agreement with USD and USD Group LLC, pursuant to which USD Group LLC has granted us a right of first offer on any midstream infrastructure assets that they may develop, construct, or acquire for a period of seven years after the October 15, 2014, closing of our IPO. Additional information regarding our growth opportunities is discussed in Item 1. Business-Future Growth Opportunities and information regarding the omnibus agreement is presented in Note 13. Transactions with Related Parties-Omnibus Agreement of Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data. We cannot assure you that USD will be able to develop or construct, or that we or USD will be able to acquire, any other midstream infrastructure projects, including any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal. Among other things, the ability of USD to further develop the Hardisty terminal, or any other project, and our ability to acquire such projects, will depend upon USD's and our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing. We are under no obligation to make any offer, and USD and USD Group LLC are under no obligation to accept any offer we make, with respect to any asset subject to our right of first offer. Additionally, the approval of Energy Capital Partners is required for the sale of any assets by USD or its subsidiaries, including us (other than sales in the ordinary course of business), acquisitions of securities of other entities that exceed specified materiality thresholds and any material unbudgeted expenditures or deviations from our approved budget. Energy Capital Partners may make these decisions free of any duty to us and our unitholders. This approval would be required for the potential acquisition by us of any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal, as well as any other projects or assets that USD may develop or acquire in the future or any third party acquisition we may pursue independently or jointly with USD. Energy Capital Partners is under no obligation to approve any such transaction. Additional discussion of the special approval rights of Energy Capital Partners is included in Item\n10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Special Approval Rights of Energy Capital Partners. If we are unable to acquire any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal from USD, which USD retained the right to develop and operate at the time of our IPO, these expansions may compete directly with our current Hardisty terminal assets for future throughput volumes, which may impact our ability to enter into new terminal services agreements, including with our existing customers, following the termination of our existing agreements or the terms thereof and our ability to compete for future spot volumes. Furthermore, cyclical changes in the demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons may cause USD or us to reevaluate any future expansion projects, including any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal. Additionally, if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our DCF.\nInterest Rate Environment\nThe interest rates available in U.S. and international credit markets remain near historic lows, although the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has stated their intent to further increase interest rates in the U.S. over the next twelve months. As the overall economy strengthens, we expect monetary policy will tighten to counter possible inflation, resulting in higher interest rates. Should interest rates continue to rise, our financing costs will increase accordingly. This could affect our future ability to access the credit markets at rates we consider reasonable to fund our future growth. Additionally, as with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price will be affected by the level of our cash distributions and an associated implied distribution yield. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units, and, as such, a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity, or increase the cost of issuing equity. However, we expect that our cost of capital would remain competitive, as our competitors would face similar circumstances.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results\nThe comparability of our current financial results in relation to prior periods are affected by the factors described below.\nOur historical results of operations include revenues and expenses related to (i) the construction of our Hardisty terminal, (ii) the operation of our San Antonio and West Colton terminals, (iii) our railcar fleet services throughout North America and (iv) the operations of our Hardisty terminal, which commenced in late June 2014. Costs incurred in the Predecessor periods with respect to the Hardisty terminal are primarily related to pre-operational activities.\nCasper Terminal Acquisition\nOur operating results for periods after November 17, 2015, include the revenues and costs associated with our operation of the Casper terminal, which we acquired on this date.\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\nOur results of operations for periods prior to our IPO included a $1.2 million management fee each year for the West Colton and San Antonio terminals. In addition, our historical selling, general and administrative costs included certain expenses allocated by our sponsor for corporate costs including insurance, professional fees, facilities, information services, human resources and other support departments, as well as direct expenses. These allocated expenses were charged or allocated to us primarily on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated evenly across the number of operating subsidiaries or allocated based on budgeted volumes or projected revenues. Our sponsor charges us a fixed annual fee for the management and operation of our assets for the provision of various centralized administrative services, as well as allocates general and administrative costs and expenses incurred by them on our behalf. In 2016, the fixed annual fee increased by approximately $0.7 million to $3.2 million, primarily as a result of hiring new employees dedicated to our services. We recently received approval from the Board of Directors to increase the fixed annual fee to $3.3 million for 2017.\nWe incur unit based compensation expense associated with the phantom units granted to directors, officers and employees of USDG pursuant to the USD Partners LP 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, and Class A units\ngranted to certain executive officers and other key employees of USDG. We recognize the expense associated with the outstanding phantom units and with each Class A Vesting Tranche ratably over its requisite service period.\nWe also incur additional general and administrative expenses annually as a result of being a publicly traded partnership, consisting of costs associated with SEC reporting requirements, tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, independent auditor fees, investor relations activities, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, stock exchange listing, registrar and transfer agent fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance and director compensation. These additional general and administrative expenses are not reflected in our historical financial statements.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nPrior to June 2014, our operating income was predominantly derived from our San Antonio and West Colton terminals and, as a result, we historically had minimal exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, we derive a significant amount of operating income from our Canadian operations, particularly our Hardisty terminal. Given our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar, our operating income and assets which are denominated in Canadian dollars will be positively affected when the Canadian dollar increases in relation to the U.S. dollar and will be negatively affected when the Canadian dollar decreases relative to the U.S. dollar, assuming all other factors are held constant. Conversely, our liabilities which are denominated in Canadian dollars will be positively affected when the Canadian dollar decreases in relation to the U.S. dollar and will be negatively affected when the Canadian dollar increases relative to the U.S. dollar. We have entered into derivative contracts to mitigate a significant portion of the potential impact that fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar may have on cash flows generated by our Hardisty terminal operations through 2017. As a result, we do not expect foreign currency exchange rates to have a significant impact on our operating cash flows in the near term. The derivative contracts in place for our 2016 fiscal year secured a minimum exchange rate of 0.84 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar for the majority of our anticipated Canadian cash flows, whereas our derivative contracts for 2015 secured a minimum exchange rate of 0.91 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. For our 2017 fiscal year, we have entered into forward contracts that effectively fix the amount we will receive in U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar at an exchange rate of approximately 0.78.\nIncome Tax Expense\nPrior to our IPO, we were included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of our sponsor, in which we were treated as an entity disregarded as separate from our sponsor for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subsequent to the closing of our IPO, we have been and continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with each partner being separately taxed on their share of our taxable income. Therefore, no U.S. federal income tax expense is reflected in our financial statements for periods prior to the October 15, 2014, closing of our IPO.\nOur Hardisty terminal is subject to Canadian income taxes that result from taxable income generated by our Canadian operations and withholding taxes that are applicable to certain distributions from our Canadian subsidiaries. Prior to commencing operations in late June 2014, our Hardisty terminal did not generate any taxable income, but produced net operating losses that were available to reduce future Canadian provincial and federal taxable income. We utilized net operating losses relating to our Canadian terminalling business during the second half of 2014 and for 2015, to the extent available, to offset Canadian taxable income generated during these periods. The combined Canadian federal and provincial income tax rate was 25% prior to the income tax rate increase enacted by the Canadian province of Alberta in June 2015, which retroactively increased the combined provincial/federal income tax rate by 1% for 2015 and an additional 1% beginning in 2016. As a result, we paid income taxes on our Canadian income at a combined provincial/federal income tax rate of 27% and 26% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have a Canadian loss carryforward of approximately $4.4 million and $4.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the benefit of which we do not expect to realize. We will also be required to pay withholding taxes at a rate of 5% on cash distributed to us from our Canadian subsidiaries in excess of amounts they have borrowed from us.\nIn 2016, prior to filing our 2015 Canadian tax returns, we adopted a methodology for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries based upon completion of a study we initially commissioned in 2015. The methodology we adopted for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries supported by this study resulted in a reduction of our Canadian income tax liability for the 2015 tax year, as reflected in the Canadian income\ntax returns we filed in 2016. The resulting decrease in our Canadian income tax liability was reflected in our 2016 income statement as a reduction to our 2016 provision for income taxes. We have also reduced our provision for income taxes in 2016 for the lower expected Canadian income tax liability we anticipate for 2016 as a result of the methodology we adopted for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries.\nFinancing\nHistorically, our operations were financed with cash generated by our operations and intercompany loans from our sponsor. On October 15, 2014, in connection with the closing of our IPO, we entered into a five-year, $300.0 million senior secured credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, comprised of a $100.0 million term loan, the Term Loan Facility (borrowed in Canadian dollars and maturing on July 14, 2019) and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, the Revolving Credit Facility (maturing on October 15, 2019), which is automatically increased as the Term Loan Facility principal is reduced.\nIn November 2015, we amended our Credit Agreement to increase our total borrowing capacity from $300 million to $400 million, while all other terms and conditions of the existing Credit Agreement remained unchanged. We also reset our ability to request an additional $100 million of incremental Revolving Credit Facility commitments, subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders or other financial institutions and satisfaction of certain conditions.\nAs of March 3, 2017, we had $214.0 million drawn on our Revolving Credit Facility and C$3.6 million (representing $2.8 million) outstanding under our Term Loan Facility in relation to the balances presented at December 31, 2016, in our consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the borrowings we have made under the terms of our Credit Agreement, our interest expense in 2016 exceeded amounts incurred in 2015 and 2014.\nWe anticipate using the cash flows generated by our Canadian subsidiaries to repay borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and borrowing up to the U.S. dollar equivalent amount under our Revolving Credit Facility, as necessary, to fund distributions to our unitholders. Following repayment of our Term Loan Facility and absent the incurrence of additional Canadian debt, we anticipate utilizing any excess cash flows produced by our Canadian subsidiaries to repay amounts they have borrowed from our U.S. entities, including us. Any amounts distributed by our Canadian subsidiaries to us in order to partially fund distributions to our unitholders, which are in excess of amounts they have borrowed from us, would be subject to Canadian withholding taxes.\nCash Distributions\nWe intend to make minimum quarterly distributions of at least $0.2875 per common unit ($1.15 per unit on an annualized basis) to the extent we have sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to our general partner. We intend to pay distributions no later than 60 days after the end of each quarter. We paid our most recent distribution on February 17, 2017, at a rate of $0.33 per common unit ($1.32 per unit on an annualized basis) for the quarter ending December 31, 2016, to unitholders of record on February 13, 2017.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe conduct our business through two distinct reporting segments: Terminalling services and Fleet services. We have established these reporting segments as strategic business units to facilitate the achievement of our long-term objectives, to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance.\nThe following table summarizes our operating results by business segment and corporate charges for each of the years indicated:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminalling services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fleet services\n</td> <td>1,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(429\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>(9,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,483\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,868\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income\n</td> <td>32,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>9,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) associated with derivative instruments\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,161\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,536\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency transaction loss (gain)\n</td> <td>(750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>(759\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,678\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSummary Analysis of Operating Results\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nOur operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015, were largely driven by the following:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a contribution of approximately $10.2 million derived from the Casper terminal operations we acquired in November 2015, partially offset by the additional interest expense we incurred on amounts borrowed for the acquisition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>additional terminalling services revenue resulting from inflation-indexed rate escalations associated with our terminalling services agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $3.5 million we recognized in connection with winding down our San Antonio Terminal operations, including an asset retirement obligation of $1.0 million for amounts we expect to spend to restore the property to its original condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>declines in our fleet services business resulting from reductions to the number of railcars in our fleet;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased corporate costs largely associated with unit based compensation due to increases in the trading price of our common units and additional amounts we are charged pursuant to the omnibus agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>non-cash losses associated with the revaluation of our foreign currency derivative instruments as compared with gains in the prior year due to a more stable exchange rate between the U.S. and Canada;

In addition, due to inflation-indexed rate escalations associated with our terminalling services agreements for our Hardisty terminal, we recognized more revenue for 2016 than we recognized during 2015, partially offset by additional amounts we deferred. Our terminalling services revenue was also affected by the decline in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Our terminalling services revenue would have been approximately $2.3 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTerminalling services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, excludes approximately $27.1 million of amounts associated with minimum monthly commitment fees we received as payment from our customers that we have deferred and recorded as short-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have deferred recognizing this revenue in connection with the minimum monthly commitment fees paid by customers of our Hardisty terminal that are in excess of their actual throughput volumes due to the make-up rights we have granted them under their terminal\nservices agreements with us. Our customers can use these make-up rights for periods of up to six months to offset throughput volumes in excess of their minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We expect to recognize the deferred amounts in revenue as our customers use these rights, upon expiration of the make-up period, or when our customers' ability to utilize those rights is determined to be remote. We recognized approximately $24.2 million of previously deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRailroad Incentive Payments\nHistorically, we have received incentive payments from railroads in connection with large capital projects that are projected to create incremental traffic on their networks. With respect to our Hardisty terminal, we have the right to receive incentive payments based on the number of railcars loaded for certain customers through mid-2017. A portion of these payments increase the pipeline fees payable to Gibson. The decline in these payments is due to a decrease in the number of railcars loaded in 2016 as compared with 2015.\nOperating Costs\nThe operating costs of our Terminalling services segment increased $22.5 million to $59.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our acquisition of the Casper terminal which added $18.6 million of incremental operating costs during 2016. Our operating expenses would have been approximately $1.2 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe continue to proactively manage our operating costs in an effort to align with the current business environment, which may result in additional cost savings over the near term. However, we do not expect these benefits to remain over the long term as market and economic conditions improve.\nSubcontracted rail services. We subcontract a majority of the services related to the operations of our terminals, which costs are primarily fixed. These subcontracted rail services costs increased $0.4 million to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the additional costs for these services incurred at our Casper terminal, which contributed approximately $2.8 million more to these costs, partially offset by a decrease in costs at our Hardisty terminal, due to a decrease in the number of railcars loaded in 2016 as compared with 2015.\nPipeline fees. We incur pipeline fees related to a facilities connection agreement with Gibson for the delivery of crude oil from Gibson's Hardisty storage terminal to our Hardisty terminal via pipeline. The pipeline fees we pay to Gibson are based on a predetermined formula, which includes amounts collected from customers at our Hardisty terminal. We may defer recognizing portions of these costs as expense until such time as we recognize the related deferred revenue following the expiration of any make-up rights provisions. Pipeline fees increased $3.6 million to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the increase in direct operating income we recognized at our Hardisty terminal.\nOperating and maintenance. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $0.9 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our acquisition of the Casper terminal.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to incremental costs associated with our management and operation of the Casper terminal.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $17.0 million to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the additional depreciation and amortization expense associated with our Casper terminal which we acquired in November 2015. In addition, we incurred a non-cash impairment loss of $3.5 million, in connection with the expected May 1,\n2017 termination of our customer contract for ethanol transloading services at our San Antonio terminal, including an asset retirement obligation of $1.0 million for amounts we expect to spend to restore the property to its original condition.\nOther Expenses\nInterest expense. Interest expense for our Terminalling services segment decreased by $1.0 million to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the lower average outstanding balance of our Term Loan Facility during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLoss associated with derivative instruments. In June 2015 and April 2016, we entered into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, specifically between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, related to operations at our Hardisty terminal. We record all of our derivative financial instruments at fair market value in our consolidated financial statements, which we adjust each period for changes in the fair market value, or mark to market.\nFrom December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, the exchange rate, representing the midpoint of the range for the bid and ask prices between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, increased from 0.7210 to 0.7440 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. This change in the exchange rate decreased the value of our derivative contracts at December 31, 2016, relative to the value at December 31, 2015, producing a loss of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. By way of comparison, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the exchange rate, between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar decreased from 0.8621 to 0.7210 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar, producing a gain of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nForeign currency transaction loss (gain) Our Terminalling services segment recognized minimal foreign currency transaction gains for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with losses of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are primarily the result of routine settlement of U.S. dollar denominated transactions with Canadian dollars by our Canadian subsidiaries.\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes. A significant amount of our operating income is generated by our Hardisty terminal, located in the Canadian province of Alberta. As a Canadian business, operating income from our Hardisty terminal is subject to corporate income tax rates enacted by the Canadian federal and the Alberta provincial governments, which on a combined basis have increased from 26% in 2015 to 27% beginning January 1, 2016. As a result, we recognized income tax liabilities and expenses in our consolidated financial statements based upon these higher income tax rates.\nOur benefit from income taxes for the Terminalling services segment was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with a provision for income taxes of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2016, prior to filing our 2015 Canadian tax returns, we adopted a methodology for determining the return attributable to the activities of our foreign subsidiaries based on the functions we provide and risks we manage on their behalf, which resulted in a reduction of our Canadian income tax liabilities for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. The resulting reduction of our Canadian income tax liabilities for 2015 was reflected as a decrease to our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in a net benefit from income taxes for 2016. We utilized net operating losses relating to our Canadian terminalling business during 2015, to the extent available, to offset Canadian taxable income generated in 2015. For 2016, we have no operating loss carryforwards available to apply towards future ordinary taxable income derived from our Canadian terminalling business.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nTerminalling Services Revenue\nRevenue generated by our Terminalling services segment increased $42.0 million to $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to our Hardisty terminal being operational for the entire twelve months in the year ended December 31, 2015, whereas during the year ended December 31, 2014, the terminal operations commenced in late June 2014. Also\ncontributing to the greater revenue in 2015 is the addition of the Casper terminal in mid-November, which provided an additional $3.8 million of revenue to our Terminalling services business. Our terminalling services revenue was also affected by the decline in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Our terminalling services revenue would have been approximately $8.3 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTerminalling services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, excludes approximately $24.2 million of amounts associated with minimum monthly commitment fees we received as payment from our customers that we have deferred and recorded as short-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have deferred recognizing this revenue in connection with the minimum monthly commitment fees paid by customers of our Hardisty terminal that are in excess of their actual throughput volumes due to the make-up rights we have granted them under their terminal services agreements with us. Our customers can use these make-up rights for periods of up to six months to offset throughput volumes in excess of their minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We recognized the deferred amounts in revenue as our customers use these rights, upon expiration of the make-up period, or when our customers' ability to utilize those rights is determined to be remote. We recognized approximately $14.6 million of previously deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRailroad Incentive Payments\nHistorically, we have received incentive payments from railroads in connection with large capital projects that are projected to create incremental traffic on their networks. With respect to our Hardisty terminal, we have the right to receive incentive payments based on the number of railcars loaded for certain customers through mid-2017. A portion of these payments increases the pipeline fees payable to Gibson. We recognized revenue of approximately $0.4 million and $0.7 million for railroad incentive payments during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in connection with the operation of our Hardisty terminal. The decline in these payments is partially due to a decrease in the number of railcars loaded in 2015 as compared with 2014, coupled with the decline in the average exchange rate for Canadian dollars in relation to U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOperating Costs\nThe operating costs of our Terminalling services segment increased $17.5 million to $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to our Hardisty terminal being operational for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months of operation in 2014 when the terminal was placed into service. Also contributing to the increase in operating expenses in 2015 is the addition of the Casper terminal in mid-November, which added $3.0 million of operating expenses. Our operating expenses would have been approximately $4.8 million dollars greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015 was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nConsistent with recent industry trends, we have proactively managed our operating costs in an effort to align with the current business environment. These efforts are likely to continue to result in cost savings over the near term. However, we do not expect these benefits to remain over the long term as market conditions improve.\nSubcontracted rail services. We subcontract a majority of the services related to the operations of our terminals, which costs are primarily fixed. These Subcontracted rail services costs increased $0.7 million to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015, which contributed approximately $0.4 million to these costs and partially due to our Hardisty terminal being operational for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months of operation in 2014 when the terminal was placed into service. Our subcontracted rail services costs would have been approximately $0.8 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nPipeline fees. We incur pipeline fees related to a facilities connection agreement with Gibson for the delivery of crude oil from Gibson's storage terminal to our Hardisty terminal via pipeline. The pipeline fees paid to Gibson are\nbased on a predetermined formula which includes amounts collected from customers at our Hardisty terminal. We may defer recognizing portions of these costs as expense until such time that we recognize the related deferred revenue following the expiration of any make up rights provisions. Pipeline fees increased $13.6 million to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our Hardisty terminal being operational for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months of operation in 2014 when the terminal was placed into service. Our pipeline fees would have been approximately $2.7 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOperating and Maintenance. Operating and maintenance expenses decreased $0.2 million to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Maintenance and repair costs were higher for the year ended December 31, 2015, than for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to maintenance repairs at our terminals. These costs were more than offset by a decrease in expenses for operational materials and supplies attributable to the decrease in the number of railcar shipments.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.2 million to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Salaries and benefits, property taxes and other administrative costs were higher for the year ended December 31, 2015, than for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015. These costs were more than offset by a $0.9 million decrease in management fees charged to the terminalling businesses in 2014 prior to our IPO that were subsequently discontinued.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.5 million to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015, which contributed approximately $1.8 million to depreciation and amortization expense and partially due to depreciation of our Hardisty terminal for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months for 2014, the year in which the terminal was placed into service. Our depreciation and amortization expense would have been approximately $0.6 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther Expenses\nInterest expense. Interest expense for our Terminalling services segment decreased by $1.6 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower weighted average balances of outstanding debt and weighted average interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, a majority of the interest expense we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015, is associated with the outstanding balance on our Term Loan Facility, which is denominated in Canadian dollars. Our interest expense would have been approximately $0.3 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, substantially all of our interest expense was denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, exchange rate fluctuations did not affect the reported interest expense.\nGain associated with derivative instruments. In May 2014 and June 2015, we entered into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, specifically between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, related to operations at our Hardisty terminal. We record all of our derivative financial instruments at fair market value in our consolidated financial statements, which we adjust each period for changes in the fair market value, or mark to market.\nFrom December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the exchange rate, representing the midpoint of the range between the bid and ask prices, between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar decreased from 0.8621 to 0.7210 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. This change in the exchange rate increased the value of our derivative contracts at\nDecember 31, 2015, relative to the value at December 31, 2014, producing a gain of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFrom May 20, 2014, when we initially executed our derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to Canadian cash flows, to December 31, 2014, the exchange rate, representing the midpoint of the range between the bid and ask prices, between the U.S. and Canadian dollars decreased from 0.9186 to 0.8621 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. This change in the exchange rate increased the value of our derivative contracts at December 31, 2014, relative to the value at May 20, 2014, producing a gain of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nForeign currency transaction loss Our Terminalling services segment recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to the routine settlement of intercompany transactions associated with the operations of our Hardisty terminal. Foreign currency transaction losses of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulted from settlement of U.S. dollar denominated bank debt in periods prior to our IPO and the recapitalization transactions completed in contemplation of our IPO, as well as routine transactions with external customers.\nProvision for income taxes. A significant amount of our operating income is generated by our Hardisty terminal, which is located in the Canadian province of Alberta. As a Canadian business, operating income from our Hardisty terminal is subject to corporate income tax rates enacted by the Canadian federal and provincial governments, which on a combined basis have increased effective July 1, 2015, from 25% to 26% of taxable income for the entirety of 2015, and which increased further to 27% beginning January 1, 2016. Our provision for income taxes for the Terminalling services segment was $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with $47 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014, partially as a result of these recently enacted tax rate changes. The increase is primarily attributable to the current and deferred income taxes associated with our Hardisty terminal operations, which commenced operations in late June 2014 and did not generate taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nFLEET SERVICES\nThe following table sets forth the operating results of our Fleet services business for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fleet leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fleet services\n</td> <td>3,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freight and other reimbursables\n</td> <td>1,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>11,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fleet leases\n</td> <td>6,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freight and other reimbursables\n</td> <td>1,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and maintenance\n</td> <td>337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating costs\n</td> <td>9,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>1,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(429\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency transaction loss (gain)\n</td> <td>(71\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(552\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nRevenues from our Fleet services segment decreased $6.2 million to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the number of railcars directly leased by us to our customers, which also resulted in a $5.7 million decrease in Fleet leases, a corresponding $0.5 million decrease in Fleet services, and no notable changes in Freight and other reimbursables revenue. The Freight and other reimbursables revenues represent customer reimbursements to us for freight and other charges that we have incurred on behalf of our customers and were exactly offset by Freight and other reimbursables costs.\nFleet leases. Fleet leases revenue decreased $5.7 million to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a reduction in the number of railcars directly leased by us for our customers. We directly leased an average of approximately 350 railcars in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately 650 railcars in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our fleet lease revenues were offset by slightly more costs we incurred to lease railcars from our lessors than we received in lease revenue due to excess mileage we agreed to pay on behalf of a customer.\nFleet services. We receive a service fee for fleet management services we provide for both the railcars we directly lease to our customers and those railcar leases that, subsequent to June 30, 2016, have been assigned to unrelated parties. The average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services decreased to approximately 3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, from approximately 3,500 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The declines are the result of non-renewal of expiring railcar leases associated with activities of our Predecessor. As a result of the decrease in the average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services, our fleet services revenue declined by $0.5 million from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016.\nOperating Costs\nOperating costs primarily consist of railcar leases and related expenses incurred for services provided to customers of our terminals. Operating costs of our fleet services segment decreased $5.6 million to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the number of directly leased railcars in our fleet and a reduction in activity, which also resulted in a decrease of $5.7 million in Fleet leases costs and essentially no change in Freight and other reimbursables costs. \"Selling, general and administrative\" and \"Operating and maintenance\" expenses were relatively consistent between periods.\nOther Expenses\nProvision for income taxes. We recognized income tax expense of $242 thousand with respect to our Fleet services business for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with $173 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, which amounts are primarily attributable to additional taxable income.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nRevenues from our Fleet services segment increased $3.7 million to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet leases associated with the Hardisty terminal being in service for the full year in 2015 and only one-half of the year in 2014, coupled with additional fleet services revenue resulting from railcar management services provided to affiliates of USD.\nFleet leases. Fleet leases revenue increased $3.0 million to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in railcars directly leased by us to our customers. Our lease revenue is directly correlated with the number of railcars we have leased to customers. We directly leased an average of approximately 650 railcars to our customers for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with approximately 600 railcars for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2014, we assigned our rights\nto payments from customers under master fleet services agreements associated with specific railcars, together with our obligations to make rental payments to the owners of the railcars, to related parties of USD. The assignment of these rights to receive payments under the master fleet services agreements and our obligations to make payments under the associated leases reduced the amount of lease revenue we otherwise would have recognized, and similarly reduced the lease costs as discussed below under operating costs.\nFleet services. We receive a service fee for fleet management services we provide for both the railcars we directly lease to our customers and those railcar leases that have been assigned to related parties of USD. The average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services increased to approximately 3,500 for the year ended December 31, 2015, from approximately 2,800 for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a result of the increase in the average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services, our fleet services revenue increased by $1.2 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\nFreight and other reimbursables. Freight and other reimbursables revenues decreased $0.6 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulting from a decrease in the delivery and shipment of railcars associated with the startup of our Hardisty terminal that occurred in 2014, partially offset by additional repairs and maintenance costs we incurred and passed through to our customers. Freight and other reimbursables revenues were exactly offset by Freight and other reimbursables costs payable to the railroads.\nOperating Costs\nOperating costs of our fleet services segment increased $0.8 million to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in Fleet leases costs for our direct leases of railcars made on behalf of our customers, partially offset by decreases in Freight and other reimbursables and Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFleet leases costs. Fleet leases costs increased $3.0 million to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in direct leases we entered for railcars that we in turn provide to our customers. A majority of the increase in railcars we leased during 2015 were for a related party of USD. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we directly leased an average of approximately 650 railcars as compared with approximately 600 for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2014, we assigned our obligations to make payments under certain railcar leases and master fleet services agreements to related parties of USD. The assignment of these obligations to make lease payments reduced the amount of lease costs we otherwise would have recognized, which is similar in amount to the reduction in lease revenue as discussed above.\nFreight and other reimbursables costs. Freight and other reimbursables costs decreased $0.6 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulting from a decrease in the costs for the delivery and shipment of railcars associated with the startup of our Hardisty terminal that occurred in 2014, partially offset by additional repairs and maintenance costs we incurred and passed through to our customers. Freight and other reimbursables costs were exactly offset by Freight and other reimbursables revenues.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses for our Fleet services segment decreased $1.7 million to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a provision for bad debts for unrecoverable reimbursable freight costs we incurred in 2014 for the initial delivery of railcars on behalf of a customer that we did not incur in 2015.\nDepreciation. Our Fleet services segment does not own any significant amounts of property upon which to record depreciation expense and, as a result, did not incur depreciation expense for either of the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nOther Expenses\nProvision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes for our Fleet services segment was $173 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, and $140 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014, in each case primarily consisting of provisions for state franchise taxes and federal income taxes of USD Rail LP.\nCORPORATE ACTIVITIES\nThe following table sets forth our corporate charges for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(9,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,483\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,868\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>8,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency transaction loss (gain)\n</td> <td>(651\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(410\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,067\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,416\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nThe Net loss associated with our corporate activities increased by $8.7 million to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.2 million, primarily due to incremental unit based compensation expense associated with the additional Phantom Units granted in February 2016 to directors and employees of our general partner and its affiliates under our Long-Term Incentive Plan. Unit based compensation expense also increased due to a higher closing price for our common units on the NYSE at December 31, 2016, compared with the closing price at December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expense also increased due to the annual adjustment of the management fee we are charged by affiliates of USDG pursuant to the omnibus agreement. Interest expense was the greatest contributor to the increases in corporate activity costs, which increased by $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a higher average balance outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility resulting from amounts we borrowed for our acquisition of the Casper terminal, as well as higher average rates of interest relative to the same period in 2015. We recognized a provision for income taxes of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting primarily of a provision for Texas state franchise tax of USD Partners LP.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nThe increase in our losses associated with our corporate activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily relates to an increase in selling, general and administrative costs and interest expense. Selling, general and administrative costs include unit based compensation expense attributable to Class A units which were granted in October 2014 and Phantom units awarded in February 2015 under our Long-term Incentive Plan, in addition to amounts we are charged pursuant to the terms of our omnibus agreement with USDG, which we entered into in October 2014 at the closing of our IPO. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, was higher than that for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the new borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in the current year.\nGrowth Opportunities for our Operations\nWe apply a disciplined approach to pursuing our growth strategy, which may include organic growth initiatives as well as acquisitions of energy-related logistics assets. Potential acquisitions may include assets developed by our sponsor or by third party logistics providers.\nOur sponsor is currently pursuing several development projects related to the storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels. These development projects are expected to be supported by long-term take-or-pay\nagreements with strategic customers which would generate stable and predictable cash flows. Energy Capital Partners has indicated an intention to invest an additional $1.0 billion of equity capital in USD, subject to market and other conditions, to support future growth and expansion plans.\nU.S. Gulf Coast\nIn October 2015, our sponsor announced a joint venture to develop a premier U.S. Gulf Coast logistics terminal on a 988-acre parcel of property on the Houston Ship Channel. Its strategic location is uniquely positioned to provide customers with flexible market access to key demand centers, both domestic and abroad. Preliminary master planning efforts suggest that the property footprint is capable of supporting up to ten to twelve million barrels of storage capacity, multiple docks (including barge and deep water), and a rail terminal with capacity to unload multiple unit trains per day. The property is in proximity to substantially all major inbound and outbound pipelines and can be directly accessed by multiple Class 1 railroads.\nWorldwide consumption of liquid fuels is estimated to have increased by over one million barrels per day in 2016 and is projected to increase by another three million barrels per day by 2018. Recent industry developments highlight the Gulf Coast's strategic importance within global energy markets and ability to meet growing demand. Exports of crude oil from PADD 3 have increased more than twenty percent since the lifting of the export ban in December 2015. Additionally, PADD 3 exports of petroleum products have increased ten percent over the last year and thirty-five percent over the last two years. Finally, given expected growth in Permian Basin crude oil production, industry participants have announced plans to add more than 600,000 Bpd of pipeline capacity to transport crude oil from West Texas to the Houston refining and distribution hub for domestic consumption or export to other markets.\nOur sponsor expects that these industry dynamics will contribute to growing demand for storage, staging, blending, export and other logistics services along the Gulf Coast, including at its Houston Ship Channel property. Accordingly, our sponsor is actively engaged in commercial negotiations with potential customers to provide solutions for both crude oil and refined products.\nWestern Canada\nWestern Canadian crude oil production is projected to increase throughout the next decade, driven primarily by developments in Alberta's oil sands region. In June 2016, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers projected that the supply of crude oil from Western Canada will grow by approximately 590,000 Bpd by 2020 and 890,000 Bpd by 2025 relative to 2015. Since then, several companies have announced plans to increase production capacity at their oil sands facilities, in part due to cost savings and optimization achieved during the recent commodity price downturn.\nFor example, Canadian Natural recently announced plans to reinstate the development of the 40,000 Bpd Kirby North project and the evaluation of an opportunity to debottleneck the Horizon fractionation tower during upcoming turnaround work, in order to increase production by 5,000 to 15,000 Bpd. Cenovus announced plans to resume construction on its 50,000 Bpd Christina Lake Phase G project and is advancing engineering work on two previously deferred expansion projects that total 75,000 Bpd of expected design capacity. MEG Energy announced an initiative at its Christina Lake Phase 2B project that is expected to increase production by approximately 20,000 Bpd. Consistent with these trends, our partner, Gibson Energy, recently commissioned ahead of schedule 2.9 million barrels of incremental storage capacity at the Hardisty hub, representing a nearly 50% increase. Gibson successfully secured short term contracts to utilize the tanks, as necessary, until the long-term take-or-pay contracts commence later in 2017.\nCertain end users, including refineries across North America, have made substantial investments in recent years in order to efficiently process heavy grades of crude oil, such as those from Western Canada. Even with recent regulatory approvals, additions to pipeline takeaway capacity are not expected to keep pace with production growth over the next several years. As a result, multiple industry forecasts project demand for rail takeaway solutions will increase in 2017 and 2018. Our Hardisty and Casper terminals, with established capacity and scalable designs, are well-positioned as strategic locations to meet expected future takeaway needs.\nOur sponsor retained the right to develop certain expansions of our Hardisty terminal, which they are actively pursuing. These expansions may include solutions to transport heavier grades of crude oil produced in Western Canada, which our sponsor believes will maximize benefits to producers, refiners and railroads.\nRight of First Offer\nIn connection with our IPO, we entered into an omnibus agreement with USD and USDG, pursuant to which we were granted a right of first offer on any midstream infrastructure assets that they may develop, construct, or acquire for a period of seven years after the October 15, 2014, closing of our IPO. Additional information about the omnibus agreement and the right of first offer are included in Note 13. Transactions with Related Parties of our consolidated financial statements at Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe cannot assure you that USD will be able to develop or construct, or that we or USD will be able to acquire, any additional midstream infrastructure projects. Among other things, the ability of USD to further develop the Hardisty terminal, or any other project, and our ability to acquire such projects, will depend upon USD's and our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing. We are under no obligation to make any offer, and USD and USDG are under no obligation to accept any offer we make, with respect to any asset subject to our right of first offer. Additionally, the approval of Energy Capital Partners is required for the sale of any assets by USD or its subsidiaries, including us (other than sales in the ordinary course of business), acquisitions of securities of other entities that exceed specified materiality thresholds and any material unbudgeted expenditures or deviations from our approved budgets. Energy Capital Partners may make these decisions free of any duty to us and our unitholders. This approval would be required for the potential acquisition by us of any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal, as well as any other projects or assets that USD may develop or acquire in the future or any third party acquisition we may pursue independently or jointly with USD. Energy Capital Partners is under no obligation to approve any such transaction. Please refer to the discussion under Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Special Approval Rights of Energy Capital Partners regarding the rights of Energy Capital Partners. If we are unable to acquire any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal from USD, which USD retained the right to develop and operate at the time of our IPO, these expansions may compete directly with our Hardisty terminal for future throughput volumes, which may impact our ability to enter into new terminal services agreements, including with our existing customers, following the termination of our existing agreements, or the terms thereof, and our ability to compete for future spot volumes. Furthermore, cyclical changes in the demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons may cause USD, or us, to further re-evaluate any future expansion projects, including expansion of the Hardisty terminal.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to make distributions to our unitholders, finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions and the costs we may incur to construct new assets, and service our debt. Historically, we have financed our operations with cash generated from our operating activities, borrowings under our credit facility and loans from our sponsor.\nLiquidity Sources\nWe expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include borrowings under our $400 million Credit Agreement, issuances of additional debt and equity securities either privately or pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement, as well as cash we generate from our operating activities. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions.\nThe following table presents our available liquidity as of the dates indicated:\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate borrowing capacity under Credit Agreement\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Term Loan Facility amounts outstanding\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Revolving Credit Facility amounts outstanding\n</td> <td>213.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>201.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Letters of credit outstanding\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available liquidity (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Pursuant to the terms of our Credit Agreement, our borrowing capacity for 2016 is limited to 4.5 times our trailing 12-month Consolidated EBITDA.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEnergy Capital Partners must approve any additional issuances of equity by us, which determinations may be made free of any duty to us or our unitholders. Members of our general partner's board of directors appointed by Energy Capital Partners must also approve the incurrence by us of additional indebtedness or refinancing outside of our existing indebtedness that is not in the ordinary course of business.\nCredit Agreement\nThe $400 million Credit Agreement is comprised of a $300 million Revolving Credit Facility, and a $100 million Term Loan Facility (borrowed in Canadian dollars), with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The Credit Agreement is a five year committed facility that matures October 15, 2019, unless amended or extended.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and issuances of letters of credit are available for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and general partnership purposes, including distributions. As we make payments on the Term Loan Facility, availability equal to the U.S. dollar equivalent amount of the payments is automatically transferred from the Term Loan Facility to the Revolving Credit Facility, ultimately increasing availability on the Revolving Credit Facility to $400 million once the Term Loan Facility is fully repaid. In addition, we have the ability to increase the maximum amount of credit available under the Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount of up to $100 million, to a total facility size of $500 million, as amended, subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders or other financial institutions and satisfaction of certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an aggregate $20 million sublimit for standby letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by our restricted subsidiaries, and are secured by a first priority lien on our assets and those of our restricted subsidiaries, other than certain excluded assets.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had amounts outstanding for the respective periods of $10.1 million and $41.5 million under the Term Loan Facility and $213.0 million and $201.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Term Loan Facility was used to fund a $100 million distribution to USDG in connection with the closing of our IPO and is guaranteed by USDG. The guaranty by USDG includes a covenant that USDG maintain a net worth (without taking into account its interests in us, either directly or indirectly) greater than the outstanding amount of the term loan. In the event the USDG net worth covenant is breached and not cured within a certain amount of time, the interest rate on the term loan increases by an additional 1.0%.\nAmounts outstanding on the Term Loan Facility are not subject to any scheduled repayment prior to its maturity on July 14, 2019. Mandatory prepayments of the Term Loan Facility are required from certain non-ordinary course asset sales subject to customary exceptions and reinvestment rights.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at a per annum rate by reference, at the borrowers' election, to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate or CDOR, a base rate, or Canadian prime rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin. Our borrowings under the Credit Agreement for revolving loans bear interest at either a base rate and Canadian prime rate, as applicable plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.25%, or at LIBOR or CDOR, as applicable, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.25% to 3.25%. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at either the base rate and Canadian prime rate, as applicable, plus a margin ranging from 1.35% to 2.35% or at LIBOR or CDOR, as applicable, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.35% to 3.35%. The applicable margin, as well as a commitment fee on the Revolving Credit Facility, ranging from 0.375% per annum to 0.50% per annum on unused commitments, will vary based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in our Credit Agreement. The actual average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness was 3.66% and 2.71% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee debt, incur liens, make investments, make restricted payments, engage in business activities, engage in mergers, consolidations and other organizational changes, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets or enter into burdensome agreements or enter into transactions with affiliates on terms that are not arm's length, in each case, subject to exceptions.\nAdditionally, we are required to maintain the following financial ratios, each determined on a quarterly basis for the immediately preceding four quarter period then ended (or such shorter period as shall apply, on an annualized basis):\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), of at least 2.50 to 1.00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consolidated Leverage Ratio of not greater than 4.50 to 1.00 (or 5.00 to 1.00 at any time after we have issued at least $150.0 million of unsecured notes). In addition, upon the consummation of a Material Acquisition (as defined in our Credit Agreement), for the fiscal quarter in which the Material Acquisition is consummated and for two fiscal quarters immediately following such fiscal quarter (the Material Acquisition Period\u201d), if elected by us by written notice to the Administrative Agent given on or prior to the date of such acquisition, the maximum permitted ratio shall be increased by 0.50 to 1.00 above the otherwise relevant level; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>after we have issued at least $150.0 million of unsecured notes, a Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 (or 4.00 to 1.00 during a Material Acquisition Period).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Credit Agreement generally prohibits us from making cash distributions (subject to exceptions as set forth in the Credit Agreement) except so long as no default exists or would be caused thereby, we may make cash distributions to unitholders up to the amount of our available cash (as defined in our partnership agreement).\nThe Credit Agreement contains events of default, including, but not limited to (and subject to grace periods in circumstances set forth in the Credit Agreement), the failure to pay any principal, interest or fees when due, failure to perform or observe any covenant that does not have certain materiality qualifiers contained in the Credit Agreement or related loan documentation, any representation, warranty or certification made or deemed made in the agreements or related loan documentation being untrue in any material respect when made, default under certain material debt agreements, commencement of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, certain changes in our ownership or the ownership of our general partner, material judgments or orders, certain judgment defaults, ERISA events or the invalidity of the loan documents. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the agreements, the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments, declare any outstanding loans to be immediately due and payable and/or exercise remedies against us and the collateral as may be available to the lenders under the agreements and related documentation or applicable law.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants set forth in our Credit Agreement.\nShelf Registration Statement\nWe have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission which allows us to issue up to $500 million in aggregate offering price of common units, preferred units\nand debt securities. The debt securities may be guaranteed by some or all of our subsidiaries. The registration statement became effective May 18, 2016 and is available for use for up to three years. We may conduct offerings under this registration statement at any time. We may use the net proceeds from any such offerings for general partnership purposes, which may include funding debt repayment, future acquisitions, capital expenditures and additions to working capital.\nCash Flows\nThe following table and discussion presents a summary of cash flows associated with our operating, investing and financing activities for the specified periods.\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,085\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(93\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(213,283\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,204\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(51,298\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued operations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td>(480\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(627\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,749\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $16.9 million to $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $36.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the cash flows produced by our Casper terminal, which we acquired in November 2015. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was partially offset by net changes in our working capital accounts resulting from the timing of receipts and payment of our accounts receivable and payable balances, as well as the increase in our restricted cash balances.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $39.3 million to $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $3.1 million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the increase in net income and the net changes in working capital associated with the operations of our Hardisty terminal, which commenced operations in late June 2014 and was fully operational during the full year ended December 31, 2015. Also contributing to our operating cash flows was our acquisition of the Casper terminal, which contributed to our cash flows from the November 17, 2015 date we acquired the business.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $213.2 million to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $213.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in 2015, with no acquisition activity in 2016. In addition, there were fewer growth capital expenditures made to enhance our terminal operations during the year ended December 31, 2016, than we made during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $179.1 million to $213.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015. Investing activities in 2014 were primarily associated with the development of the Hardisty terminal, which was fully operational during 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $199.3 million to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from net cash provided of $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2016 we\npaid cash distributions of $29.7 million and repaid the equivalent of $33.6 million on our Term Loan Facility (representing C$44.0 million) and $8.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $20.0 million we received from borrowing on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $102.3 million to $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we borrowed $203 million on our Revolving Credit facility, which was primarily used for the acquisition of the Casper terminal. Partially offsetting the proceeds we received from financing activities were cash distributions of $24.0 million and repayment on our Term Loan Facility of $30.5 million. During 2014, we received net proceeds of $137.5 million from our initial public offering after underwriting discounts, commissions and reimbursements of USDG for expenses of the offering. We also received $67.8 million, net of deferred financing costs, from the Bank of Oklahoma credit facility, which we used to repay a loan previously made to us by our sponsor for the development of the Hardisty terminal. In addition, we received proceeds of $100 million on our Term loan which we distributed to USDG. We also received a $14.3 million contribution from our sponsor in 2014. These proceeds were partially offset by repayment of $97.8 million on our Bank of Oklahoma credit facility, repayment of $49.4 million on loans outstanding from our parent and repayment of $15.0 million on our Term Loan Facility.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nWe use the cash generated by our reporting segments to support our liquidity position. Our segments offer different services and are managed accordingly. Our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, regularly reviews financial information about both segments in order to allocate resources and evaluate performance. Our CODM assesses segment performance based on the cash flows produced by our established reporting segments using Segment Adjusted EBITDA. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" adjusted for changes in working capital items, changes in restricted cash, interest, income taxes, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, adjustments related to deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees and other items which do not affect the underlying cash flows produced by our businesses.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Net cash provided by operating activities:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTerminalling Services Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA from our Terminalling services segment increased $22.2 million to $67.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased $30.0 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2015, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase for 2016 is primarily the result of cash generated by our Casper terminal, which we acquired in November 2015. The increase in 2015 is primarily due to a full year of operating our Hardisty terminal whereas in 2014 the Hardisty terminal was only operational for half of the year.\nFleet Services Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA from our Fleet services segment decreased $0.6 million to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in 2016 is primarily the result of a reduction in the total number of railcars in our fleet from which we generate cash for providing services primarily in support of customers of our terminals. In 2015, the number of railcars in our fleet was greater than in 2014, thus producing more cash from the services provided.\nCash Requirements\nOur primary requirements for capital are for funding capital expenditures, including acquisitions and the costs we may incur to construct new assets, servicing our debt and making distributions to our unitholders.\nCapital Requirements\nOur historical capital expenditures have primarily consisted of the costs to construct and acquire energy-related logistics assets. Our operations are expected to require investments to expand, upgrade or enhance existing facilities and to meet environmental and operational regulations.\nOur partnership agreement requires that we categorize our capital expenditures as either expansion capital expenditures, maintenance capital expenditures or investment capital expenditures.\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expansion capital expenditures are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term. Examples of expansion capital expenditures include the acquisition of terminals, rail lines and railcars or other complementary midstream assets from USD or third parties and the construction or development of new terminals or additional capacity at our existing terminals to the extent such capital expenditures are expected to expand our operating capacity or operating income. Expansion capital expenditures include interest payments (and related fees) on debt incurred to finance all or a portion of expansion capital expenditures in respect of the period from the date that we enter into a binding obligation to commence the construction, development, replacement, improvement or expansion of a capital asset and ending on the earlier to occur of the date that such capital improvement commences commercial service and the date that such capital improvement is disposed of or abandoned.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintenance capital expenditures are cash expenditures made to maintain, over the long term, our operating capacity, operating income or our asset base. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures to repair and refurbish our terminals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investment capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that are neither maintenance capital expenditures nor expansion capital expenditures. Investment capital expenditures will largely consist of capital expenditures made for investment purposes. Examples of investment capital expenditures include traditional capital expenditures for investment purposes, such as purchases of securities, as well as other capital expenditures that might be made in lieu of such traditional investment capital expenditures, such as the acquisition of a capital asset for investment purposes or development of facilities that are in excess of the maintenance of our existing operating capacity or operating income, but that are not expected to expand our operating capacity or operating income over the long term.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on the nature of our operations, our assets typically require minimal to no maintenance capital expenditures. However, we expect to incur costs to maintain our assets in compliance with sound business practice, our contractual relationships and applicable regulatory requirements, some of which will be characterized as maintenance capital expenditures. Both our Hardisty and Casper terminals were constructed in 2014, and therefore, we do not expect to incur significant maintenance capital expenditures in the near term to maintain the operating capacity of these facilities.\nWe incurred $238 thousand of maintenance capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily at our Casper terminal for environmental monitoring and security equipment. We had no maintenance capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We record routine maintenance expenses we incur in connection with the operation of our assets in \"Operating and maintenance\" expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur total expansion capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $0.5 million and were for planned growth projects at our Hardisty and Casper terminals. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our total expansion capital expenditures were $212.1 million and were primarily for our acquisition of the Casper terminal coupled with enhancements made to our Hardisty terminal to increase load pressure and provide for alternative power sources to keep the terminal operational in the event of a power loss. We expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash on our balance sheet, cash flow generated from our operations, borrowing on our Revolving Credit Facility, the issuance of additional partnership interests or long-term debt.\nDebt Service\nWe anticipate reducing our outstanding indebtedness to the extent we generate cash flows in excess of our operating and investing needs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repaid C$44.0 million on our Term Loan Facility (the equivalent of $33.6 million) and $8.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. These payments were partially offset by proceeds from borrowing $20.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility, which we used for general partnership purposes.\nDistributions\nWe intend to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of at least $0.2875 per unit. Our most recently declared quarterly distribution of $0.3300 per unit equates to approximately $7.6 million per quarter, or $30.6 million per year, based on the number of common, Class A, subordinated, and general partner units outstanding as of February 13, 2017. Notwithstanding the recommendation of the management of our general partner, members of our general partner's board of directors appointed by Energy Capital Partners, if any, must approve any distributions made by us.\nOther Items Affecting Liquidity\nCredit Risk\nOur exposure to credit risk may be affected by the concentration of customers, as well as changes in economic or other conditions. Our customers' businesses react differently to changing conditions. We believe that our credit-review procedures, loss reserves, customer deposits and collection procedures have adequately provided for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe currently derive a significant portion of our cash flow from our Canadian operations, particularly our Hardisty\nterminal. As a result, portions of our cash and cash equivalents are denominated in Canadian dollars and are held by foreign subsidiaries, which amounts are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into a variety of contractual obligations and other commitments. The following table summarizes the principal amount of our future minimum obligations and commitments that have remaining non-cancellable terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2016:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating services agreements (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td>24,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (3)\n</td> <td>25,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Agreement (4)\n</td> <td>223,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>These future obligations represent labor service agreements at our terminal facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases for land, building, track, and railcars.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Interest payable on our Credit Agreement is variable.

Subsequent events of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for a discussion regarding our subsequent events.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nRefer to Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for a discussion regarding recent accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to off-balance sheet arrangements relating to various master fleet services agreements, whereby we have agreed to assign certain payment and other obligations to third party special purpose entities that are not consolidated with us. We have also entered into agreements to provide fleet services to these special purpose entities for fixed servicing fees and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. The purpose of these transactions is to remove the risk to us of non-payment by our customers, which would otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. For more information on these special purpose entities see the discussion of our relationship with the variable interest entities described in Note 12 - Nonconsolidated Variable Interest Entities and Note 13 - Transactions with Related Parties to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. Liabilities related to these arrangements are generally not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material impact on our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition as a result of these off-balance sheet arrangements.\nPrior to July 1, 2016, a member of the board of directors of USD exercised control over the VIEs, resulting in these entities being classified as related parties during that period. Related party sales to the special purpose entities were $0.8 million, $1.9 million and $1.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These sales are recorded in \"Fleet services-related party\" on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRelated party deferred revenues from the special purpose entities were $2.8 million as of December 31, 2015, which were recorded in \"Deferred revenue-related party\" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as new accounting pronouncements have been issued. Accounting decisions generally involve an interpretation of existing accounting principles and the use of judgment in applying those principles to the specific circumstances existing in our business. We make every effort to comply with all applicable accounting principles and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of these principles is critical. However, not all situations we encounter are specifically addressed in the accounting literature. In such cases, we must use our best judgment to implement accounting policies that clearly and accurately present the substance of these situations. We accomplish this by analyzing similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them and consulting with experts about the appropriate interpretation and application of the accounting literature to these situations.\nIn addition to the above, certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities. The basis for our estimates is historical experience, consultation with experts and other sources we believe to be reliable. While we believe our estimates are appropriate, actual results can and often do differ from these estimates. Any effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nWe believe our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in the following paragraphs address the more significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Each of these areas involve complex situations and a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates related to the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities with the Audit Committee of the board of directors of our general partner.\nThe following discussion relates to the critical accounting policies and estimates for both USD Partners LP and our Predecessor. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. The following accounting policies are considered critical because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events, some over which we may have little or no control. Significant estimates by management include the estimated lives of depreciable property and equipment, recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, and provision and deferral of income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are derived from railcar loading and offloading services for bulk liquid products including crude oil, biofuels, and related products, as well as sourcing railcar fleets and related logistics and maintenance services. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the buyer's price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition, we record revenues for Fleet services on a gross basis when we are deemed the primary obligor for the services. We also record revenues from reimbursable costs on a gross basis as reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses are included in revenues and operating costs.\nRevenues for Terminalling services are recognized when services are provided based on the contractual rates related to throughput volumes. Our terminalling services agreements typically contain take-or-pay\u201d provisions whereby we are entitled to a minimum monthly commitment fee. In accordance with the terms of these agreements, we recognize the portions of these minimum monthly commitment fees paid for volumes in excess of actual throughput when the customer's ability to make up the minimum volume has expired, the throughput is utilized or when it is determined that the likelihood that the customer will utilize the make-up rights is remote. Revenue for Fleet services and related\nparty administrative services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue for reimbursable costs is recognized as the costs are incurred. We have deferred revenues for amounts collected from customers in our Fleet services segment, which will be recognized as revenue when earned pursuant to the contractual terms. We have prepaid rent associated with these deferred revenues on our railcar leases, which will be recognized as expense when incurred.\nCapitalization Policies and Depreciation Methods\nWe record property and equipment at its original cost, which we depreciate on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to 20 years. Our determination of the useful lives of property and equipment requires us to make various assumptions when the assets are acquired or placed into service about the expected usage, normal wear and tear and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements that extend the service life or capacity of existing property and equipment are capitalized. Upon the sale or retirement of an asset, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in our operating results.\nDuring construction we capitalize direct costs, such as labor, materials and overhead, as well as interest cost we may incur on indebtedness at our incremental borrowing rate.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is considered impaired when the sum of the estimated, undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Factors that indicate potential impairment include: a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset, and a significant change in the asset's physical condition or use.\nWhen alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long-lived asset are under consideration, estimates of future undiscounted cash flows take into account possible outcomes and probabilities of their occurrence. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset.\nAssessment of Recoverability of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is only included in our Terminalling services segment.\nWe do not amortize goodwill, but test it for impairment annually based on the carrying values of our reporting units on the first day of the third quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. The assessment of the recoverability of goodwill is highly subjective due to frequent changes in economic conditions underlying the assumptions upon which the valuations are based and global factors affecting the prices for crude oil and demand for our services. In assessing our ability to recover the carrying value of goodwill, we make critical assumptions that include but are not limited to:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>our projections of future financial performance, which include contract renewal expectations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>our expected market weighted average cost of capital;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>an expected range of EBITDA multiples derived from equity prices of public companies with similar operating and investment characteristics; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>an expected range of EBITDA multiples for transactions based on actual sales and purchases of comparable businesses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value. We reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its fair value at the time we determine that an impairment has occurred.\nThe approximately $33.6 million balance of our goodwill originated from our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015 and is wholly attributed to this reporting unit. We measured the fair value of our Casper terminal reporting unit using customary business valuation techniques including an income analysis, market analysis and transaction analysis, which we weighted at 50%, 25% and 25%, respectively. The critical assumptions used in our analysis include the following:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>A weighted average cost of capital of 10%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>A capital structure consisting of approximately 35% debt and 65% equity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>A range of EBITDA multiples derived from stock prices of public companies with similar operating and investment characteristics, from 9x to 10x; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>A range of EBITDA multiples for transactions based on actual sales and purchases of comparable businesses, from 8.5x to 9.5x.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe key assumptions listed above were based upon economic conditions existing at or prior to the July 1, 2016, valuation date. Our weighted average cost of capital is subject to variability and is dependent upon such factors as changes in benchmark rates of interest established by the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board, the British Bankers Association and other central banking regulatory authorities, as well as perceptions of risk and market uncertainty regarding our business, industry and those of our peers and our underlying capital structure. We expect our long-term underlying capital structure to approximate a weighting of 50% debt and 50% equity. Each of the above assumptions are likely to change due to economic uncertainty surrounding global and North American energy markets that are highly correlated with crude oil, natural gas and other energy-related commodity prices and other market factors.\nAssumptions we make under the income approach include our projections of future financial performance of the Casper terminal reporting unit, which include contract renewal expectations and commitments regarding the use of these facilities. To the extent that our assumptions for contract renewals and customer commitments vary from what we experience in the future, our projections of future financial performance underlying the fair value derived from the income approach of the Casper terminal reporting unit could yield results that are significantly different from those produced.\nThe EBITDA multiples we used to estimate the fair value of the Casper terminal reporting unit are subject to uncertainty associated with market conditions in the energy sector. We derived the assumption based upon EBITDA multiples for several peer organizations that operate in the mid-stream energy sector, generally providing services associated with the transportation of energy-related products. The EBITDA multiples of each of these entities is affected by changes in the supply of and demand for energy-related products, which affects the demand for the services they provide. Declines in the production of energy-related products as well as lower demand for these products can reduce the operating results of these organizations and accordingly, the multiples that market participants are willing to pay for EBITDA, which is used as a proxy for cash flow. Changes in the EBITDA multiples of the peer organizations we use to estimate fair value could significantly affect the fair value of the Casper terminal reporting unit we derived using this approach.\nThe EBITDA multiples from executed purchase and sales transactions of businesses that are similar to our Casper terminal reporting unit we used to estimate the fair value are also subject to variability, which is dependent upon market conditions in the energy sector, as well as the perceived benefits the acquiring entity expects to derive from the transaction. The transactions comprising the pool occurred during the immediately preceding two years and future transactions may have no correlation to the EBITDA multiples for similar transactions in the future. Further deterioration in economic conditions in the energy sector could result in a greater number of distressed sales at lower EBITDA multiples than currently estimated. Additionally, a representative sample of transactions in the future may not provide\na sufficient population upon which to derive an EBITDA multiple. These factors, among others, could cause our estimates of fair value for the Casper terminal reporting unit to vary significantly from the amounts determined under this method.\nAs indicated above, our estimate of fair value for the Casper terminal reporting unit required us to use significant unobservable inputs representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including assumptions related to the future performance of our Casper terminal. We completed our impairment analysis of goodwill and determined that the fair value of the Casper terminal reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at July 1, 2016, by an amount slightly greater than 9%. We have not observed any events or circumstances subsequent to our analysis that would suggest the fair value of our Casper terminal is below its carrying amount as of December 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes or for a majority of the states that impose an income tax. Taxes on our net income are generally borne by our unitholders through the allocation of taxable income, except for USD Rail LP, which, on October 7, 2014, elected to be classified as an entity taxable as a corporation. Our income tax expense is predominantly attributable to Canadian federal and provincial income taxes imposed on our operations based in Canada. Additionally, we are subject to state income tax laws that apply to entities organized as partnerships by the State of Texas. This state income tax is computed on our modified gross margin, which we have determined to be an income tax as set forth in the authoritative accounting guidance. Our current and historical provision for income taxes also reflects income taxes associated with USD Rail LP.\nWe recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the relevant basis of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. We record the impact of changes in tax legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period the legislation is enacted.\nPursuant to the authoritative accounting guidance regarding uncertain tax positions, we recognize the tax effects of any uncertain tax position as the largest amount that will more likely than not be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority having full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Under this criterion, we evaluate the most likely resolution of an uncertain tax position based on its technical merits and on the outcome that we expect would likely be sustained under examination.\nNet income for financial statement purposes may differ significantly from taxable income of unitholders as a result of differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and the taxable income allocation requirements under our partnership agreement. The aggregate difference in the basis of our net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined because information regarding each partner's tax attributes in us is not available.\nForeign Currency\nA substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Canada and are accounted for in the local currency, the Canadian dollar, which we translate into our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. We translate most Canadian dollar denominated balance sheet accounts at the end of period exchange rate, while most income statement accounts are translated monthly based on the average exchange rate for each monthly period. Amounts translated from foreign currencies into our U.S. dollar reporting currency can vary between periods due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar.", "item_7_truncated": " \u2022 the Casper terminal operations, which we acquired in November 2015, contributed approximately $0.8 million to the operating income of our Terminalling services business; \nDistributions\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating services agreements (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td>24,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (3)\n</td> <td>25,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Agreement (4)\n</td> <td>223,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nDemand for Rail Transportation of Crude Oil and Biofuels\nFleet leases. Fleet leases revenue increased $3.0 million to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in railcars directly leased by us to our customers. Our lease revenue is directly correlated with the number of railcars we have leased to customers. We directly leased an average of approximately 650 railcars to our customers for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with approximately 600 railcars for the year ended December 31, 2014.

We intend to leverage our industry relationships and market knowledge to successfully execute on such opportunities, which we may pursue independently or jointly with USD. We have entered into an omnibus agreement with USD and USD Group LLC, pursuant to which USD Group LLC has granted us a right of first offer on any midstream infrastructure assets that they may develop, construct, or acquire for a period of seven years after the October 15, 2014, closing of our IPO. Additional information regarding our growth opportunities is discussed in Item 1. Business-Future Growth Opportunities and information regarding the omnibus agreement is presented in Note 13. Transactions with Related Parties-Omnibus Agreement of Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data. We cannot assure you that USD will be able to develop or construct, or that we or USD will be able to acquire, any other midstream infrastructure projects, including any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal. Among other things, the ability of USD to further develop the Hardisty terminal, or any other project, and our ability to acquire such projects, will depend upon USD's and our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing. We are under no obligation to make any offer, and USD and USD Group LLC are under no obligation to accept any offer we make, with respect to any asset subject to our right of first offer. Additionally, the approval of Energy Capital Partners is required for the sale of any assets by USD or its subsidiaries, including us (other than sales in the ordinary course of business), acquisitions of securities of other entities that exceed specified materiality thresholds and any material unbudgeted expenditures or deviations from our approved budget. Energy Capital Partners may make these decisions free of any duty to us and our unitholders. This approval would be required for the potential acquisition by us of any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal, as well as any other projects or assets that USD may develop or acquire in the future or any third party acquisition we may pursue independently or jointly with USD.

Given that both our Hardisty and Casper terminals were constructed in 2014, we do not expect to incur significant maintenance expenditures in the near term to maintain the operating capacity of these facilities. We record routine maintenance expenses associated with operating our assets in \"Operating and maintenance\" costs in our consolidated statements of operations. Our operating and maintenance expenses are comprised primarily of pipeline fees, repairs and maintenance expenses, materials and supplies, subcontracted rail expenses, utility costs, insurance premiums and rent for facilities and equipment. In addition, our operating expenses include the cost of leasing railcars from third-party railcar suppliers and the shipping fees charged by railroads, which costs are generally passed through to our customers. Although our assets are relatively new, we expect to incur costs to maintain these assets in compliance with sound business practices, our contractual relationships and to comply with regulatory requirements for operating\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur Credit Agreement generally prohibits us from making cash distributions (subject to exceptions as set forth in the Credit Agreement) except so long as no default exists or would be caused thereby, we may make cash distributions to unitholders up to the amount of our available cash (as defined in our partnership agreement).\n (4) Represents deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees in excess of throughput utilized, which fees are not refundable to the customers.

partnership formed by USD to acquire, develop and operate energy-related logistics assets, including rail terminals and other high-quality and complementary midstream infrastructure. Our principal assets consist of: (i) a crude oil origination terminal in Hardisty, Alberta, Canada, with capacity to load up to two 120-railcar unit trains per day, (ii) a crude oil terminal in Casper, Wyoming, with unit train-capable railcar loading capacity in excess of 100,000 barrels per day, or Bpd, and six customer-dedicated storage tanks with 900,000 barrels, or Bbls, of total capacity and (iii) two unit train-capable ethanol destination terminals in San Antonio, Texas, and West Colton, California. Our terminals provide critical infrastructure allowing our customers to transport energy-related products from multiple supply regions to numerous demand markets that are dependent on these products. In addition, we provide our customers with railcars and fleet services related to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail under multi-year, take-or-pay contracts. As of December 31, 2016, our railcar fleet consisted of 2,953 railcars, which we leased from various railcar manufacturers and financial entities, including 2,108 coiled and insulated, or C&I, railcars.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 a contribution of approximately $10.2 million derived from the Casper terminal operations we acquired in November 2015, partially offset by the additional interest expense we incurred on amounts borrowed for the acquisition; \nThe increase in our losses associated with our corporate activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily relates to an increase in selling, general and administrative costs and interest expense. Selling, general and administrative costs include unit based compensation expense attributable to Class A units which were granted in October 2014 and Phantom units awarded in February 2015 under our Long-term Incentive Plan, in addition to amounts we are charged pursuant to the terms of our omnibus agreement with USDG, which we entered into in October 2014 at the closing of our IPO. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, was higher than that for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the new borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in the current year.\nWe expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include borrowings under our $400 million Credit Agreement, issuances of additional debt and equity securities either privately or pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement, as well as cash we generate from our operating activities. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions.\nDeferred Revenues Generated from Our Hardisty Operations\nFleet leases. Fleet leases revenue decreased $5.7 million to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a reduction in the number of railcars directly leased by us for our customers. We directly leased an average of approximately 350 railcars in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately 650 railcars in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our fleet lease revenues were offset by slightly more costs we incurred to lease railcars from our lessors than we received in lease revenue due to excess mileage we agreed to pay on behalf of a customer.\n (4) an expected range of EBITDA multiples for transactions based on actual sales and purchases of comparable businesses. \n (4) A range of EBITDA multiples for transactions based on actual sales and purchases of comparable businesses, from 8.5x to 9.5x. \nRevenues\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nLoss associated with derivative instruments. In June 2015 and April 2016, we entered into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, specifically between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, related to operations at our Hardisty terminal. We record all of our derivative financial instruments at fair market value in our consolidated financial statements, which we adjust each period for changes in the fair market value, or mark to market.\n (2) our expected market weighted average cost of capital; \n\nFleet leases costs. Fleet leases costs increased $3.0 million to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in direct leases we entered for railcars that we in turn provide to our customers. A majority of the increase in railcars we leased during 2015 were for a related party of USD. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we directly leased an average of approximately 650 railcars as compared with approximately 600 for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2014, we assigned our obligations to make payments under certain railcar leases and master fleet services agreements to related parties of USD. The assignment of these obligations to make lease payments reduced the amount of lease costs we otherwise would have recognized, which is similar in amount to the reduction in lease revenue as discussed above.\nRevenues are derived from railcar loading and offloading services for bulk liquid products including crude oil, biofuels, and related products, as well as sourcing railcar fleets and related logistics and maintenance services. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the buyer's price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition, we record revenues for Fleet services on a gross basis when we are deemed the primary obligor for the services. We also record revenues from reimbursable costs on a gross basis as reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses are included in revenues and operating costs.\nOur operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015, were largely driven by the following:\nWith additional volumes of crude oil handled at our Hardisty and Casper terminals, we expect to incur additional operating costs, including subcontracted rail services and pipeline fees.\nHistorically, we have received incentive payments from railroads in connection with large capital projects that are projected to create incremental traffic on their networks. With respect to our Hardisty terminal, we have the right to receive incentive payments based on the number of railcars loaded for certain customers through mid-2017. A portion of these payments increases the pipeline fees payable to Gibson. We recognized revenue of approximately $0.4 million and $0.7 million for railroad incentive payments during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in connection with the operation of our Hardisty terminal. The decline in these payments is partially due to a decrease in the number of railcars loaded in 2015 as compared with 2014, coupled with the decline in the average exchange rate for Canadian dollars in relation to U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2015.\n (2) A capital structure consisting of approximately 35% debt and 65% equity; \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Net cash provided by operating activities:\nFLEET SERVICES\n \u2022 a reduction in our income taxes resulting from a methodology we adopted for determining the return attributable to the activities of our foreign subsidiaries based on the functions we provide and risks we manage on their behalf, which resulted in a reduction of our Canadian income tax liabilities for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. \nOur total expansion capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $0.5 million and were for planned growth projects at our Hardisty and Casper terminals. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our total expansion capital expenditures were $212.1 million and were primarily for our acquisition of the Casper terminal coupled with enhancements made to our Hardisty terminal to increase load pressure and provide for alternative power sources to keep the terminal operational in the event of a power loss. We expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash on our balance sheet, cash flow generated from our operations, borrowing on our Revolving Credit Facility, the issuance of additional partnership interests or long-term debt.\nAdjusted EBITDA from our Fleet services segment decreased $0.6 million to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in 2016 is primarily the result of a reduction in the total number of railcars in our fleet from which we generate cash for providing services primarily in support of customers of our terminals. In 2015, the number of railcars in our fleet was greater than in 2014, thus producing more cash from the services provided.\nWhen alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long-lived asset are under consideration, estimates of future undiscounted cash flows take into account possible outcomes and probabilities of their occurrence. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset.\nThe following table and discussion presents a summary of cash flows associated with our operating, investing and financing activities for the specified periods.\nThe Credit Agreement contains events of default, including, but not limited to (and subject to grace periods in circumstances set forth in the Credit Agreement), the failure to pay any principal, interest or fees when due, failure to perform or observe any covenant that does not have certain materiality qualifiers contained in the Credit Agreement or related loan documentation, any representation, warranty or certification made or deemed made in the agreements or related loan documentation being untrue in any material respect when made, default under certain material debt agreements, commencement of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, certain changes in our ownership or the ownership of our general partner, material judgments or orders, certain judgment defaults, ERISA events or the invalidity of the loan documents. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the agreements, the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments, declare any outstanding loans to be immediately due and payable and/or exercise remedies against us and the collateral as may be available to the lenders under the agreements and related documentation or applicable law.\n\nFor example, Canadian Natural recently announced plans to reinstate the development of the 40,000 Bpd Kirby North project and the evaluation of an opportunity to debottleneck the Horizon fractionation tower during upcoming turnaround work, in order to increase production by 5,000 to 15,000 Bpd. Cenovus announced plans to resume construction on its 50,000 Bpd Christina Lake Phase G project and is advancing engineering work on two previously deferred expansion projects that total 75,000 Bpd of expected design capacity. MEG Energy announced an initiative at its Christina Lake Phase 2B project that is expected to increase production by approximately 20,000 Bpd. Consistent with these trends, our partner, Gibson Energy, recently commissioned ahead of schedule 2.9 million barrels of incremental storage capacity at the Hardisty hub, representing a nearly 50% increase. Gibson successfully secured short term contracts to utilize the tanks, as necessary, until the long-term take-or-pay contracts commence later in 2017.\nOur business is subject to the risk that we will not be able to renew, extend or replace our customer contracts as their terms expire. Each of the seven terminalling services agreements with our Hardisty terminal customers has an initial contract term of five years and expires in 2019. The initial term of six of these agreements commenced between June 30, 2014 and August 1, 2014, and the initial term of a seventh agreement commenced on October 1, 2014. The three terminalling services agreements with our Casper terminal customers have initial contract terms expiring in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Our sole customer contract for our San Antonio terminal has a term expiring in May 2017, and we anticipate that this customer will not renew or extend this contract further as it moves its business to a new wholly-owned terminal it is constructing. Our sole customer contract for our West Colton terminal is with the same customer at our San Antonio terminal and is terminable at any time by either party upon 150 days' notice.\nWe currently derive a significant portion of our cash flow from our Canadian operations, particularly our Hardisty\n \u2022 a full year of operation of our Hardisty terminal, which commenced operation in late June 2014 and contributed approximately $23.1 million to the operating income of our Terminalling services business for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with a contribution of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014; \nSubcontracted rail services. We subcontract a majority of the services related to the operations of our terminals, which costs are primarily fixed. These subcontracted rail services costs increased $0.4 million to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the additional costs for these services incurred at our Casper terminal, which contributed approximately $2.8 million more to these costs, partially offset by a decrease in costs at our Hardisty terminal, due to a decrease in the number of railcars loaded in 2016 as compared with 2015.\nForeign currency transaction loss Our Terminalling services segment recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to the routine settlement of intercompany transactions associated with the operations of our Hardisty terminal. Foreign currency transaction losses of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulted from settlement of U.S. dollar denominated bank debt in periods prior to our IPO and the recapitalization transactions completed in contemplation of our IPO, as well as routine transactions with external customers.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to incremental costs associated with our management and operation of the Casper terminal.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe operating costs of our Terminalling services segment increased $17.5 million to $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to our Hardisty terminal being operational for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months of operation in 2014 when the terminal was placed into service. Also contributing to the increase in operating expenses in 2015 is the addition of the Casper terminal in mid-November, which added $3.0 million of operating expenses. Our operating expenses would have been approximately $4.8 million dollars greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015 was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTerminalling Services Revenue\n \u2022 the sustainability of our current distribution rate per unit. \nOperating Activities\n \u2022 Investment capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that are neither maintenance capital expenditures nor expansion capital expenditures. Investment capital expenditures will largely consist of capital expenditures made for investment purposes. Examples of investment capital expenditures include traditional capital expenditures for investment purposes, such as purchases of securities, as well as other capital expenditures that might be made in lieu of such traditional investment capital expenditures, such as the acquisition of a capital asset for investment purposes or development of facilities that are in excess of the maintenance of our existing operating capacity or operating income, but that are not expected to expand our operating capacity or operating income over the long term. \n \u2022 Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), of at least 2.50 to 1.00; \nWe generate substantially all of our operating cash flow by charging fixed fees for handling energy-related products and providing related services. We do not take ownership of the underlying products that we handle nor do we receive any payments from our customers based on the value of such products. Thus, we have no direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices, although these risks could indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long term.\nDecember 31, 2015, relative to the value at December 31, 2014, producing a gain of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWorldwide consumption of liquid fuels is estimated to have increased by over one million barrels per day in 2016 and is projected to increase by another three million barrels per day by 2018. Recent industry developments highlight the Gulf Coast's strategic importance within global energy markets and ability to meet growing demand. Exports of crude oil from PADD 3 have increased more than twenty percent since the lifting of the export ban in December 2015. Additionally, PADD 3 exports of petroleum products have increased ten percent over the last year and thirty-five percent over the last two years. Finally, given expected growth in Permian Basin crude oil production, industry participants have announced plans to add more than 600,000 Bpd of pipeline capacity to transport crude oil from West Texas to the Houston refining and distribution hub for domestic consumption or export to other markets.\n (1) A weighted average cost of capital of 10%; \npaid cash distributions of $29.7 million and repaid the equivalent of $33.6 million on our Term Loan Facility (representing C$44.0 million) and $8.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $20.0 million we received from borrowing on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur Hardisty terminal is subject to Canadian income taxes that result from taxable income generated by our Canadian operations and withholding taxes that are applicable to certain distributions from our Canadian subsidiaries. Prior to commencing operations in late June 2014, our Hardisty terminal did not generate any taxable income, but produced net operating losses that were available to reduce future Canadian provincial and federal taxable income. We utilized net operating losses relating to our Canadian terminalling business during the second half of 2014 and for 2015, to the extent available, to offset Canadian taxable income generated during these periods. The combined Canadian federal and provincial income tax rate was 25% prior to the income tax rate increase enacted by the Canadian province of Alberta in June 2015, which retroactively increased the combined provincial/federal income tax rate by 1% for 2015 and an additional 1% beginning in 2016. As a result, we paid income taxes on our Canadian income at a combined provincial/federal income tax rate of 27% and 26% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have a Canadian loss carryforward of approximately $4.4 million and $4.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the benefit of which we do not expect to realize. We will also be required to pay withholding taxes at a rate of 5% on cash distributed to us from our Canadian subsidiaries in excess of amounts they have borrowed from us.\n10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Special Approval Rights of Energy Capital Partners. If we are unable to acquire any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal from USD, which USD retained the right to develop and operate at the time of our IPO, these expansions may compete directly with our current Hardisty terminal assets for future throughput volumes, which may impact our ability to enter into new terminal services agreements, including with our existing customers, following the termination of our existing agreements or the terms thereof and our ability to compete for future spot volumes. Furthermore, cyclical changes in the demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons may cause USD or us to reevaluate any future expansion projects, including any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal. Additionally, if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our DCF.\nWe intend to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of at least $0.2875 per unit. Our most recently declared quarterly distribution of $0.3300 per unit equates to approximately $7.6 million per quarter, or $30.6 million per year, based on the number of common, Class A, subordinated, and general partner units outstanding as of February 13, 2017. Notwithstanding the recommendation of the management of our general partner, members of our general partner's board of directors appointed by Energy Capital Partners, if any, must approve any distributions made by us.\nSubcontracted rail services. We subcontract a majority of the services related to the operations of our terminals, which costs are primarily fixed. These Subcontracted rail services costs increased $0.7 million to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015, which contributed approximately $0.4 million to these costs and partially due to our Hardisty terminal being operational for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months of operation in 2014 when the terminal was placed into service. Our subcontracted rail services costs would have been approximately $0.8 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\na sufficient population upon which to derive an EBITDA multiple. These factors, among others, could cause our estimates of fair value for the Casper terminal reporting unit to vary significantly from the amounts determined under this method.\nGain associated with derivative instruments. In May 2014 and June 2015, we entered into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, specifically between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, related to operations at our Hardisty terminal. We record all of our derivative financial instruments at fair market value in our consolidated financial statements, which we adjust each period for changes in the fair market value, or mark to market.\n (4) Includes amounts we received as a partial refund of approximately $3.7 million (representing C$4.9 million) for our 2015 foreign income taxes. \n \u2022 the excess cash flow being retained for use in enhancing our existing business; and \nWe provide our customers with railcars and fleet services related to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail on a multi-year, take-or-pay basis under master fleet services agreements for periods ranging from five to nine years. We do not own any railcars. As of December 31, 2016, our railcar fleet consisted of 2,953 railcars, which we leased from various railcar manufacturers and financial entities, including 2,108 C&I railcars. We have assigned certain payment and performance obligations under the leases and master fleet service agreements for 2,613 of the railcars to other parties, but we have retained certain rights and obligations with respect to the servicing of these railcars. Approximately 84% of our current railcar fleet is dedicated to customers of our Hardisty terminal. The remaining 16% of our railcar fleet is dedicated to a customer of terminals belonging to subsidiaries previously sold by our predecessor. The master fleet services agreements we have with certain of our Hardisty terminal customers have a weighted-average remaining contract life of 4.6 years as of December 31, 2016. In the aggregate, our master fleet services agreements have a weighted-average remaining contract life of 4.1 years as of December 31, 2016.\nSupply and Demand for Crude Oil and Refined Products\n (2) Represents costs incurred associated with unrecovered reimbursable freight costs related to the initial delivery of railcars in support of the Hardisty terminal. \nCash Distributions\nWe apply a disciplined approach to pursuing our growth strategy, which may include organic growth initiatives as well as acquisitions of energy-related logistics assets. Potential acquisitions may include assets developed by our sponsor or by third party logistics providers.\nForeign currency transaction loss (gain) Our Terminalling services segment recognized minimal foreign currency transaction gains for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with losses of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are primarily the result of routine settlement of U.S. dollar denominated transactions with Canadian dollars by our Canadian subsidiaries.\nHistorically, we contracted with railroads on behalf of some of our customers to arrange for the movement of railcars from our terminals to the destinations selected by our customers. We were the contracting party with the railroads for those shipments and were responsible to the railroads for the related fees charged by the railroads, for which we were reimbursed by our customers. Both the fees charged by the railroads to us and the reimbursement of these fees by our customers are included in our consolidated statements of operations in the revenues and operating costs line items entitled Freight and other reimbursables.\u201d\nIn August 2016, we received notification from the customer of our San Antonio terminal stating their intent to terminate their terminalling services agreement with us in early February 2017, which was extended in January 2017 to early May 2017. In early February 2017, the lessor of the real property upon which the San Antonio terminal resides indicated their intent to terminate our lease with them concurrently with the conclusion of the extension agreement for terminalling services we have with our customer, at which time we expect to wind down the operations of this terminal. As a result we have recognized a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, including an asset retirement obligation of $1.0 million for amounts we expect to spend to restore the property to its original condition. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our San Antonio terminal contributed less than 3% of our Adjusted EBITDA. Except as indicated above, we do not expect the termination of this agreement to have a material impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for our Terminalling services segment decreased by $1.6 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower weighted average balances of outstanding debt and weighted average interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, a majority of the interest expense we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015, is associated with the outstanding balance on our Term Loan Facility, which is denominated in Canadian dollars. Our interest expense would have been approximately $0.3 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, substantially all of our interest expense was denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, exchange rate fluctuations did not affect the reported interest expense.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.2 million to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Salaries and benefits, property taxes and other administrative costs were higher for the year ended December 31, 2015, than for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015. These costs were more than offset by a $0.9 million decrease in management fees charged to the terminalling businesses in 2014 prior to our IPO that were subsequently discontinued.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $213.2 million to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $213.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in 2015, with no acquisition activity in 2016. In addition, there were fewer growth capital expenditures made to enhance our terminal operations during the year ended December 31, 2016, than we made during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nOur sponsor retained the right to develop certain expansions of our Hardisty terminal, which they are actively pursuing. These expansions may include solutions to transport heavier grades of crude oil produced in Western Canada, which our sponsor believes will maximize benefits to producers, refiners and railroads.\n \u2022 our ability to renew contracts with existing customers, enter into contracts with new customers, increase customer commitments and throughput volumes at our terminals, and provide additional ancillary services at those terminals. \n \u2022 Maintenance capital expenditures are cash expenditures made to maintain, over the long term, our operating capacity, operating income or our asset base. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures to repair and refurbish our terminals. \nterminal. As a result, portions of our cash and cash equivalents are denominated in Canadian dollars and are held by foreign subsidiaries, which amounts are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to evaluate our operations. We consider these metrics to be significant factors in assessing our ability to generate cash and pay distributions and include: (i) Adjusted EBITDA and DCF; (ii) operating and maintenance expenses; and (iii) volumes. We define Adjusted EBITDA and DCF below.\nOther Expenses\nFactors That May Impact Future Results of Operations\nAmounts outstanding on the Term Loan Facility are not subject to any scheduled repayment prior to its maturity on July 14, 2019. Mandatory prepayments of the Term Loan Facility are required from certain non-ordinary course asset sales subject to customary exceptions and reinvestment rights.\nWe do not amortize goodwill, but test it for impairment annually based on the carrying values of our reporting units on the first day of the third quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. The assessment of the recoverability of goodwill is highly subjective due to frequent changes in economic conditions underlying the assumptions upon which the valuations are based and global factors affecting the prices for crude oil and demand for our services. In assessing our ability to recover the carrying value of goodwill, we make critical assumptions that include but are not limited to:\nWe record property and equipment at its original cost, which we depreciate on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to 20 years. Our determination of the useful lives of property and equipment requires us to make various assumptions when the assets are acquired or placed into service about the expected usage, normal wear and tear and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements that extend the service life or capacity of existing property and equipment are capitalized. Upon the sale or retirement of an asset, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in our operating results.\nOperating and Maintenance. Operating and maintenance expenses decreased $0.2 million to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Maintenance and repair costs were higher for the year ended December 31, 2015, than for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to maintenance repairs at our terminals. These costs were more than offset by a decrease in expenses for operational materials and supplies attributable to the decrease in the number of railcar shipments.\nAs indicated above, our estimate of fair value for the Casper terminal reporting unit required us to use significant unobservable inputs representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including assumptions related to the future performance of our Casper terminal. We completed our impairment analysis of goodwill and determined that the fair value of the Casper terminal reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at July 1, 2016, by an amount slightly greater than 9%. We have not observed any events or circumstances subsequent to our analysis that would suggest the fair value of our Casper terminal is below its carrying amount as of December 31, 2016.\nAssessment of Recoverability of Goodwill\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to off-balance sheet arrangements relating to various master fleet services agreements, whereby we have agreed to assign certain payment and other obligations to third party special purpose entities that are not consolidated with us. We have also entered into agreements to provide fleet services to these special purpose entities for fixed servicing fees and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. The purpose of these transactions is to remove the risk to us of non-payment by our customers, which would otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. For more information on these special purpose entities see the discussion of our relationship with the variable interest entities described in Note 12 - Nonconsolidated Variable Interest Entities and Note 13 - Transactions with Related Parties to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. Liabilities related to these arrangements are generally not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material impact on our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition as a result of these off-balance sheet arrangements.\nLiquidity Sources\ncontributing to the greater revenue in 2015 is the addition of the Casper terminal in mid-November, which provided an additional $3.8 million of revenue to our Terminalling services business. Our terminalling services revenue was also affected by the decline in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Our terminalling services revenue would have been approximately $8.3 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe also incur additional general and administrative expenses annually as a result of being a publicly traded partnership, consisting of costs associated with SEC reporting requirements, tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, independent auditor fees, investor relations activities, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, stock exchange listing, registrar and transfer agent fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance and director compensation. These additional general and administrative expenses are not reflected in our historical financial statements.\nThe EBITDA multiples we used to estimate the fair value of the Casper terminal reporting unit are subject to uncertainty associated with market conditions in the energy sector. We derived the assumption based upon EBITDA multiples for several peer organizations that operate in the mid-stream energy sector, generally providing services associated with the transportation of energy-related products. The EBITDA multiples of each of these entities is affected by changes in the supply of and demand for energy-related products, which affects the demand for the services they provide. Declines in the production of energy-related products as well as lower demand for these products can reduce the operating results of these organizations and accordingly, the multiples that market participants are willing to pay for EBITDA, which is used as a proxy for cash flow. Changes in the EBITDA multiples of the peer organizations we use to estimate fair value could significantly affect the fair value of the Casper terminal reporting unit we derived using this approach.\nEthanol Terminal Services Agreements. We have terminal services agreements with subsidiaries of an investment grade company for our San Antonio and West Colton terminals pursuant to which we are paid fixed fees per gallon of ethanol transloaded at each terminal. In August 2016, we received notification from the customer of our San Antonio terminal of their intent to terminate their terminalling services agreement with us, effective February 2017, which date was extended in January 2017 to May 1, 2017. In early February 2017, the lessor of the real property upon which the San Antonio terminal resides indicated their intent to terminate our lease with them concurrently with the conclusion of the extension agreement for terminalling services we have with our customer, at which time we expect to wind down the operations of this terminal. The agreement entitles the customer to 100% of the terminal's capacity, subject to our right to seek additional customers if minimum volume usage thresholds are not met. We expect to wind down the operations of our San Antonio terminal following the May 1, 2017, termination date as discussed in more detail below under General Trends and Outlook - San Antonio Terminal and in Note 7. Property and Equipment to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. The West Colton terminal services agreement has been in place since July 2009 and is terminable at any time by either party upon 150 days' notice. We are seeking permits to construct an approximately one-mile pipeline directly from our West Colton terminal to Kinder Morgan Inc.'s gasoline blending terminals, which, if approved and constructed, may result in long-term volume commitments and cash flows.\nRelated party deferred revenues from the special purpose entities were $2.8 million as of December 31, 2015, which were recorded in \"Deferred revenue-related party\" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\ngranted to certain executive officers and other key employees of USDG. We recognize the expense associated with the outstanding phantom units and with each Class A Vesting Tranche ratably over its requisite service period.\nFor example, Canadian Natural Resources recently announced plans to reinstate the development of the 40,000 Bpd Kirby North project and the evaluation of an opportunity to debottleneck the Horizon fractionation tower during upcoming turnaround work in order to increase production by 5,000 to 15,000 Bpd. Cenovus announced plans to resume construction on its 50,000 Bpd Christina Lake Phase G project and is advancing engineering work on two previously deferred expansion projects that total 75,000 Bpd of expected design capacity. MEG Energy announced an initiative at its Christina Lake Phase 2B project that is expected to increase production by approximately 20,000 Bpd. Consistent with these trends, our partner, Gibson Energy, recently commissioned ahead of schedule 2.9 million barrels of incremental storage capacity at the Hardisty hub, representing a nearly 50% increase. Gibson successfully secured short term contracts to utilize the tanks, as necessary, until the long-term take-or-pay contracts commence later in 2017.\nWe cannot assure you that USD will be able to develop or construct, or that we or USD will be able to acquire, any additional midstream infrastructure projects. Among other things, the ability of USD to further develop the Hardisty terminal, or any other project, and our ability to acquire such projects, will depend upon USD's and our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing. We are under no obligation to make any offer, and USD and USDG are under no obligation to accept any offer we make, with respect to any asset subject to our right of first offer. Additionally, the approval of Energy Capital Partners is required for the sale of any assets by USD or its subsidiaries, including us (other than sales in the ordinary course of business), acquisitions of securities of other entities that exceed specified materiality thresholds and any material unbudgeted expenditures or deviations from our approved budgets. Energy Capital Partners may make these decisions free of any duty to us and our unitholders. This approval would be required for the potential acquisition by us of any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal, as well as any other projects or assets that USD may develop or acquire in the future or any third party acquisition we may pursue independently or jointly with USD. Energy Capital Partners is under no obligation to approve any such transaction. Please refer to the discussion under Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Special Approval Rights of Energy Capital Partners regarding the rights of Energy Capital Partners. If we are unable to acquire any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal from USD, which USD retained the right to develop and operate at the time of our IPO, these expansions may compete directly with our Hardisty terminal for future throughput volumes, which may impact our ability to enter into new terminal services agreements, including with our existing customers, following the termination of our existing agreements, or the terms thereof, and our ability to compete for future spot volumes. Furthermore, cyclical changes in the demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons may cause USD, or us, to further re-evaluate any future expansion projects, including expansion of the Hardisty terminal.\nInterest Rate Environment\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $179.1 million to $213.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015. Investing activities in 2014 were primarily associated with the development of the Hardisty terminal, which was fully operational during 2015.\nPrior to our IPO, we were included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of our sponsor, in which we were treated as an entity disregarded as separate from our sponsor for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subsequent to the closing of our IPO, we have been and continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with each partner being separately taxed on their share of our taxable income. Therefore, no U.S. federal income tax expense is reflected in our financial statements for periods prior to the October 15, 2014, closing of our IPO.\nWe incur unit based compensation expense associated with the phantom units granted to directors, officers and employees of USDG pursuant to the USD Partners LP 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, and Class A units\nSummary Analysis of Operating Results\nPrior to June 2014, our operating income was predominantly derived from our San Antonio and West Colton terminals and, as a result, we historically had minimal exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, we derive a significant amount of operating income from our Canadian operations, particularly our Hardisty terminal. Given our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar, our operating income and assets which are denominated in Canadian dollars will be positively affected when the Canadian dollar increases in relation to the U.S. dollar and will be negatively affected when the Canadian dollar decreases relative to the U.S. dollar, assuming all other factors are held constant. Conversely, our liabilities which are denominated in Canadian dollars will be positively affected when the Canadian dollar decreases in relation to the U.S. dollar and will be negatively affected when the Canadian dollar increases relative to the U.S. dollar. We have entered into derivative contracts to mitigate a significant portion of the potential impact that fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar may have on cash flows generated by our Hardisty terminal operations through 2017. As a result, we do not expect foreign currency exchange rates to have a significant impact on our operating cash flows in the near term. The derivative contracts in place for our 2016 fiscal year secured a minimum exchange rate of 0.84 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar for the majority of our anticipated Canadian cash flows, whereas our derivative contracts for 2015 secured a minimum exchange rate of 0.91 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. For our 2017 fiscal year, we have entered into forward contracts that effectively fix the amount we will receive in U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar at an exchange rate of approximately 0.78.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $102.3 million to $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we borrowed $203 million on our Revolving Credit facility, which was primarily used for the acquisition of the Casper terminal. Partially offsetting the proceeds we received from financing activities were cash distributions of $24.0 million and repayment on our Term Loan Facility of $30.5 million. During 2014, we received net proceeds of $137.5 million from our initial public offering after underwriting discounts, commissions and reimbursements of USDG for expenses of the offering. We also received $67.8 million, net of deferred financing costs, from the Bank of Oklahoma credit facility, which we used to repay a loan previously made to us by our sponsor for the development of the Hardisty terminal. In addition, we received proceeds of $100 million on our Term loan which we distributed to USDG. We also received a $14.3 million contribution from our sponsor in 2014. These proceeds were partially offset by repayment of $97.8 million on our Bank of Oklahoma credit facility, repayment of $49.4 million on loans outstanding from our parent and repayment of $15.0 million on our Term Loan Facility.\nOur Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee debt, incur liens, make investments, make restricted payments, engage in business activities, engage in mergers, consolidations and other organizational changes, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets or enter into burdensome agreements or enter into transactions with affiliates on terms that are not arm's length, in each case, subject to exceptions.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" adjusted for changes in working capital items, changes in restricted cash, interest, income taxes, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, adjustments related to deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees and other items which do not affect the underlying cash flows produced by our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP, supplemental financial measure used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe comparability of our current financial results in relation to prior periods are affected by the factors described below.\nRailroad Incentive Payments\nCertain end users, including refineries across North America, have made substantial investments in recent years in order to efficiently process heavy grades of crude oil, such as those from Western Canada. Even with recent regulatory approvals, additions to pipeline takeaway capacity are not expected to keep pace with production growth over the next several years. As a result, multiple industry forecasts project demand for rail takeaway solutions will increase in 2017 and 2018. Our Hardisty and Casper terminals, with established capacity and scalable designs, are well-positioned as strategic locations to meet expected future takeaway needs.\nCash Flows\n (3) Interest payable on our Credit Agreement is variable. We estimated interest through maturity using rates in effect on December 31, 2016. \n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $199.3 million to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from net cash provided of $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2016 we\nSubstantially all of our operating cash flows are generated from take-or-pay contracts and, as a result, are not directly related to actual throughput volumes at our terminals. The volume of crude oil loaded at our Hardisty and Casper terminals is primarily influenced by the difference in price between Western Canadian Select, or WCS, and other grades of crude oil processed by refiners, commonly referred to as spreads, rather than absolute price levels. Spreads are influenced by, among other things, the availability of crude oil supplies relative to the level of demand from end users, such as refiners.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nWe estimate our 2017 income tax provision to approximate C$5.7 million, based upon the current operations of our foreign subsidiaries. These estimates are subject to changes in the underlying operating activities and results of these foreign subsidiaries, as well as fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, among other factors.\nPipeline fees. We incur pipeline fees related to a facilities connection agreement with Gibson for the delivery of crude oil from Gibson's Hardisty storage terminal to our Hardisty terminal via pipeline. The pipeline fees we pay to Gibson are based on a predetermined formula, which includes amounts collected from customers at our Hardisty terminal. We may defer recognizing portions of these costs as expense until such time as we recognize the related deferred revenue following the expiration of any make-up rights provisions. Pipeline fees increased $3.6 million to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the increase in direct operating income we recognized at our Hardisty terminal.\nThe operating costs of our Terminalling services segment increased $22.5 million to $59.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our acquisition of the Casper terminal which added $18.6 million of incremental operating costs during 2016. Our operating expenses would have been approximately $1.2 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBased on the nature of our operations, our assets typically require minimal to no maintenance capital expenditures. However, we expect to incur costs to maintain our assets in compliance with sound business practice, our contractual relationships and applicable regulatory requirements, some of which will be characterized as maintenance capital expenditures. Both our Hardisty and Casper terminals were constructed in 2014, and therefore, we do not expect to incur significant maintenance capital expenditures in the near term to maintain the operating capacity of these facilities.\nFrom May 20, 2014, when we initially executed our derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to Canadian cash flows, to December 31, 2014, the exchange rate, representing the midpoint of the range between the bid and ask prices, between the U.S. and Canadian dollars decreased from 0.9186 to 0.8621 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. This change in the exchange rate increased the value of our derivative contracts at December 31, 2014, relative to the value at May 20, 2014, producing a gain of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTerminalling services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, excludes approximately $24.2 million of amounts associated with minimum monthly commitment fees we received as payment from our customers that we have deferred and recorded as short-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have deferred recognizing this revenue in connection with the minimum monthly commitment fees paid by customers of our Hardisty terminal that are in excess of their actual throughput volumes due to the make-up rights we have granted them under their terminal services agreements with us. Our customers can use these make-up rights for periods of up to six months to offset throughput volumes in excess of their minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We recognized the deferred amounts in revenue as our customers use these rights, upon expiration of the make-up period, or when our customers' ability to utilize those rights is determined to be remote. We recognized approximately $14.6 million of previously deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nand debt securities. The debt securities may be guaranteed by some or all of our subsidiaries. The registration statement became effective May 18, 2016 and is available for use for up to three years. We may conduct offerings under this registration statement at any time. We may use the net proceeds from any such offerings for general partnership purposes, which may include funding debt repayment, future acquisitions, capital expenditures and additions to working capital.\nOperating costs primarily consist of railcar leases and related expenses incurred for services provided to customers of our terminals. Operating costs of our fleet services segment decreased $5.6 million to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the number of directly leased railcars in our fleet and a reduction in activity, which also resulted in a decrease of $5.7 million in Fleet leases costs and essentially no change in Freight and other reimbursables costs. \"Selling, general and administrative\" and \"Operating and maintenance\" expenses were relatively consistent between periods.\nProvision for income taxes. We recognized income tax expense of $242 thousand with respect to our Fleet services business for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with $173 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, which amounts are primarily attributable to additional taxable income.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and issuances of letters of credit are available for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and general partnership purposes, including distributions. As we make payments on the Term Loan Facility, availability equal to the U.S. dollar equivalent amount of the payments is automatically transferred from the Term Loan Facility to the Revolving Credit Facility, ultimately increasing availability on the Revolving Credit Facility to $400 million once the Term Loan Facility is fully repaid. In addition, we have the ability to increase the maximum amount of credit available under the Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount of up to $100 million, to a total facility size of $500 million, as amended, subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders or other financial institutions and satisfaction of certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an aggregate $20 million sublimit for standby letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by our restricted subsidiaries, and are secured by a first priority lien on our assets and those of our restricted subsidiaries, other than certain excluded assets.\nFleet Services Segment\n (4) Principal repayment obligations under our Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2016. \nThe key assumptions listed above were based upon economic conditions existing at or prior to the July 1, 2016, valuation date. Our weighted average cost of capital is subject to variability and is dependent upon such factors as changes in benchmark rates of interest established by the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board, the British Bankers Association and other central banking regulatory authorities, as well as perceptions of risk and market uncertainty regarding our business, industry and those of our peers and our underlying capital structure. We expect our long-term underlying capital structure to approximate a weighting of 50% debt and 50% equity. Each of the above assumptions are likely to change due to economic uncertainty surrounding global and North American energy markets that are highly correlated with crude oil, natural gas and other energy-related commodity prices and other market factors.\nSan Antonio Terminal\nThe following table sets forth the operating results of our Terminalling services business and the approximate average daily throughput volumes of our terminals for the specified periods:\nThe amount of Terminalling services revenue we generate depends on minimum customer commitment fees and the volume of crude oil that we handle at our terminals in excess of those minimum commitments, as well as the volume of biofuels transloaded at our ethanol terminals. These volumes are primarily affected by the supply of and demand for crude oil, refined products and biofuels in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Additionally, these volumes are affected by the spreads between the benchmark prices for these products, which are influenced by, among other things, the available takeaway capacity in those markets. Although customers at our Hardisty and Casper terminals have committed to minimum monthly fees under their terminal services agreements with us, which will generate the majority of our Terminalling services revenue, our results of operations will also be affected by:\n \u2022 the favorable impact of gains on the foreign currency derivative instrument contracts we entered into in May 2014 and June 2015, which were largely offset by the continued deterioration of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, that reduced the operating results of our Canadian subsidiaries when translated into U.S. dollars. \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.5 million to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015, which contributed approximately $1.8 million to depreciation and amortization expense and partially due to depreciation of our Hardisty terminal for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months for 2014, the year in which the terminal was placed into service. Our depreciation and amortization expense would have been approximately $0.6 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nMarket Update\nFrom December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, the exchange rate, representing the midpoint of the range for the bid and ask prices between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, increased from 0.7210 to 0.7440 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. This change in the exchange rate decreased the value of our derivative contracts at December 31, 2016, relative to the value at December 31, 2015, producing a loss of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. By way of comparison, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the exchange rate, between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar decreased from 0.8621 to 0.7210 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar, producing a gain of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCasper Terminal Services Agreements. Our Casper terminal is supported by take-or-pay terminal services agreements with high quality, primarily investment grade refiners. The initial term of the agreements varies from three to five years, with extension or renewal options for one to three additional years, and a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 1.96 years as of December 31, 2016. Under these terminal services agreements, our customers are obligated to pay the greater of a minimum monthly commitment fee or a throughput fee based on the actual volume of crude oil loaded. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its maximum allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit which may be used to offset future throughput fees in excess of the minimum monthly commitment fees, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. Unused credits generally expire if not used by the end of each calendar quarter.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nTerminalling Services\n \u2022 after we have issued at least $150.0 million of unsecured notes, a Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 (or 4.00 to 1.00 during a Material Acquisition Period). \nservices agreements with us. Our customers can use these make-up rights for periods of up to six months to offset throughput volumes in excess of their minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We expect to recognize the deferred amounts in revenue as our customers use these rights, upon expiration of the make-up period, or when our customers' ability to utilize those rights is determined to be remote. We recognized approximately $24.2 million of previously deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFreight and other reimbursables. Freight and other reimbursables revenues decreased $0.6 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulting from a decrease in the delivery and shipment of railcars associated with the startup of our Hardisty terminal that occurred in 2014, partially offset by additional repairs and maintenance costs we incurred and passed through to our customers. Freight and other reimbursables revenues were exactly offset by Freight and other reimbursables costs payable to the railroads.\nCapital Requirements\nConsistent with recent industry trends, we have proactively managed our operating costs in an effort to align with the current business environment. These efforts are likely to continue to result in cost savings over the near term. However, we do not expect these benefits to remain over the long term as market conditions improve.\nHistorically, we have received incentive payments from railroads in connection with large capital projects that are projected to create incremental traffic on their networks. With respect to our Hardisty terminal, we have the right to receive incentive payments based on the number of railcars loaded for certain customers through mid-2017. A portion of these payments increase the pipeline fees payable to Gibson. The decline in these payments is due to a decrease in the number of railcars loaded in 2016 as compared with 2015.\nHigh-growth crude oil production areas in North America are often located at significant distances from refining centers, creating constantly evolving regional imbalances, which require the expedited development of flexible and sustainable transportation solutions. The extensive existing rail network, combined with rail transportation's relatively low capital and fixed costs compared to other transportation alternatives, has strategically positioned rail as a long-term transportation solution to growing and evolving energy infrastructure needs. In the event that additional pipeline capacity is constructed, or crude oil production decreases significantly, demand for transportation of crude oil by rail may be impacted.\nOther Expenses\nCustomer Contract Expirations and Renewals\n (3) an expected range of EBITDA multiples derived from equity prices of public companies with similar operating and investment characteristics; and \n (1) Pursuant to the terms of our Credit Agreement, our borrowing capacity for 2016 is limited to 4.5 times our trailing 12-month Consolidated EBITDA. \nIn October 2015, our sponsor announced a joint venture to develop a premier U.S. Gulf Coast logistics terminal on a 988-acre parcel of property on the Houston Ship Channel. Its strategic location is uniquely positioned to provide customers with flexible market access to key demand centers, both domestic and abroad. Preliminary master planning efforts suggest that the property footprint is capable of supporting up to ten to twelve million barrels of storage capacity, multiple docks (including barge and deep water), and a rail terminal with capacity to unload multiple unit trains per day. The property is in proximity to substantially all major inbound and outbound pipelines and can be directly accessed by multiple Class 1 railroads.\nThe interest rates available in U.S. and international credit markets remain near historic lows, although the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has stated their intent to further increase interest rates in the U.S. over the next twelve months. As the overall economy strengthens, we expect monetary policy will tighten to counter possible inflation, resulting in higher interest rates. Should interest rates continue to rise, our financing costs will increase accordingly. This could affect our future ability to access the credit markets at rates we consider reasonable to fund our future growth. Additionally, as with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price will be affected by the level of our cash distributions and an associated implied distribution yield. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units, and, as such, a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity, or increase the cost of issuing equity. However, we expect that our cost of capital would remain competitive, as our competitors would face similar circumstances.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value. We reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its fair value at the time we determine that an impairment has occurred.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - BY SEGMENT\nIncome Taxes\nUnder the master fleet services agreements, we provide customers with railcar-specific fleet services, which may include, among other things, the provision of relevant administrative and billing services, the maintenance of railcars in accordance with standard industry practice and applicable laws, the management and tracking of the movement of railcars, the regulatory and administrative reporting and compliance as required in connection with the movement of railcars, and the negotiation for and sourcing of railcars. Our customers typically pay us and our assignees monthly fees per railcar for these services, which include a component for railcar use and a component for fleet services.\nOther Items Affecting Liquidity\nU.S. Gulf Coast\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nTerminalling services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, excludes approximately $27.1 million of amounts associated with minimum monthly commitment fees we received as payment from our customers that we have deferred and recorded as short-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have deferred recognizing this revenue in connection with the minimum monthly commitment fees paid by customers of our Hardisty terminal that are in excess of their actual throughput volumes due to the make-up rights we have granted them under their terminal\nFleet services. We receive a service fee for fleet management services we provide for both the railcars we directly lease to our customers and those railcar leases that have been assigned to related parties of USD. The average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services increased to approximately 3,500 for the year ended December 31, 2015, from approximately 2,800 for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a result of the increase in the average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services, our fleet services revenue increased by $1.2 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses for our Fleet services segment decreased $1.7 million to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a provision for bad debts for unrecoverable reimbursable freight costs we incurred in 2014 for the initial delivery of railcars on behalf of a customer that we did not incur in 2015.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results\nAcquisition Opportunities\nCredit Risk\nAdditionally, we are required to maintain the following financial ratios, each determined on a quarterly basis for the immediately preceding four quarter period then ended (or such shorter period as shall apply, on an annualized basis):\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes. A significant amount of our operating income is generated by our Hardisty terminal, located in the Canadian province of Alberta. As a Canadian business, operating income from our Hardisty terminal is subject to corporate income tax rates enacted by the Canadian federal and the Alberta provincial governments, which on a combined basis have increased from 26% in 2015 to 27% beginning January 1, 2016. As a result, we recognized income tax liabilities and expenses in our consolidated financial statements based upon these higher income tax rates.\nthe year ended December 31, 2015, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase for 2016 is primarily the result of cash generated by our Casper terminal, which we acquired in November 2015. The increase in 2015 is primarily due to a full year of operating our Hardisty terminal whereas in 2014 the Hardisty terminal was only operational for half of the year.\nThe following table sets forth our corporate charges for each of the periods indicated:\nAdjusted EBITDA from our Terminalling services segment increased $22.2 million to $67.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased $30.0 million for\nOperating Costs\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this discussion to USD Partners, USDP, the Partnership, we, our, us or like terms used in the present tense or prospectively (periods beginning on or after October 15, 2014) refer to USD Partners LP and its subsidiaries. References to the Predecessor, we, our, us, or like terms, when used in a historical context (periods prior to October 15, 2014), refer to the following subsidiaries, collectively, that were contributed to USD Partners in connection with our initial public offering of 9,120,000 common units completed on October 15, 2014: San Antonio Rail Terminal LLC, USD Logistics Operations GP LLC, USD Logistics Operations LP, USD Rail LP, USD Rail Canada ULC, USD Rail International S.A.R.L., USD Terminals Canada ULC, USD Terminals International S.A.R.L. and West Colton Rail Terminal LLC, collectively, the Contributed Subsidiaries.\" The Predecessor also includes the membership interests in the following five subsidiaries of US Development Group LLC, or USD, which operated crude oil rail terminals that were sold in December 2012: Bakersfield Crude Terminal LLC, Eagle Ford Crude Terminal LLC, Niobrara Crude Terminal LLC, St. James Rail Terminal LLC, and Van Hook Crude Terminal LLC, collectively known as the Discontinued Operations.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this report.\nOur sponsor retained the right to develop certain expansions of our Hardisty terminal, which they are actively pursuing. These expansions may include solutions to transport heavier grades of crude oil produced in Western Canada, which our sponsor believes will maximize benefits to producers, refiners and railroads. Our sponsor is also currently in discussions with potential customers related to its proposed development of a marine terminal joint venture on the Houston Ship Channel. We anticipate that any solutions developed by our sponsor would be subject to the right of first offer in our favor contained in the omnibus agreement between us and USD.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\n \u2022 additional terminalling services revenue resulting from inflation-indexed rate escalations associated with our terminalling services agreements; \nOperating and Maintenance Expenses\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to make distributions to our unitholders, finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions and the costs we may incur to construct new assets, and service our debt. Historically, we have financed our operations with cash generated from our operating activities, borrowings under our credit facility and loans from our sponsor.\n \u2022 the amount of cash available for making distributions to our unitholders; \n \u2022 increased corporate costs largely associated with unit based compensation due to increases in the trading price of our common units and additional amounts we are charged pursuant to the omnibus agreement; \n\nProvision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes for our Fleet services segment was $173 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, and $140 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014, in each case primarily consisting of provisions for state franchise taxes and federal income taxes of USD Rail LP.\nFleet services. We receive a service fee for fleet management services we provide for both the railcars we directly lease to our customers and those railcar leases that, subsequent to June 30, 2016, have been assigned to unrelated parties. The average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services decreased to approximately 3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, from approximately 3,500 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The declines are the result of non-renewal of expiring railcar leases associated with activities of our Predecessor. As a result of the decrease in the average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services, our fleet services revenue declined by $0.5 million from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016.\nHistorically, our operations were financed with cash generated by our operations and intercompany loans from our sponsor. On October 15, 2014, in connection with the closing of our IPO, we entered into a five-year, $300.0 million senior secured credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, comprised of a $100.0 million term loan, the Term Loan Facility (borrowed in Canadian dollars and maturing on July 14, 2019) and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, the Revolving Credit Facility (maturing on October 15, 2019), which is automatically increased as the Term Loan Facility principal is reduced.\nOne of the customers at our Casper terminal, whose terminalling services agreement with us represented approximately $12 million of our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, has a remaining term expiring in the third quarter of 2017, if not otherwise renewed or extended. This customer did not exercise its option to extend the agreement for an additional three-year term. We remain in active discussions with this customer, as well as other existing and potential new customers, for the provision of terminalling services by our Casper Terminal. We also are in active discussions with respect to the provision of terminalling services at our Hardisty terminal for periods following the terms of our existing agreements. Projected growth in Western Canada crude oil production, including recently announced additions to oil sands production capacity, represents a meaningful opportunity to meet upcoming takeaway needs with our strategically-positioned and scalable assets, particularly given current industry headwinds for new infrastructure projects. For a discussion of the risks associated with our ability to renew, extend or replace customer contracts, see Risk Factors - Our contracts subject us to renewal risks.\nWe completed a study we commissioned in 2015 to evaluate the appropriate return attributable to the activities of our foreign subsidiaries, based upon the performance of risk management and other functions we provide. Based upon the results of this study, we adopted a methodology for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries and concluded the return initially attributed to the activities of our foreign subsidiaries exceeded the amounts considered to be reasonable based on the functions we provide on behalf of these subsidiaries. As a result, we determined that we had over-estimated our foreign income tax liability for 2015 by approximately $4.4 million, a majority of which was refunded to us prior to December 31, 2016. We received an additional refund of approximately $0.6 million (representing C$0.9 million) in February 2017 and do not expect any additional income tax refunds with respect to our 2015 Canadian income taxes.\nOperating Costs\nWe anticipate reducing our outstanding indebtedness to the extent we generate cash flows in excess of our operating and investing needs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repaid C$44.0 million on our Term Loan Facility (the equivalent of $33.6 million) and $8.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. These payments were partially offset by proceeds from borrowing $20.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility, which we used for general partnership purposes.\nCash Requirements\nTerminalling Services Segment\nWe recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the relevant basis of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. We record the impact of changes in tax legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period the legislation is enacted.\nOperating Costs\nIn addition to the above, certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities. The basis for our estimates is historical experience, consultation with experts and other sources we believe to be reliable. While we believe our estimates are appropriate, actual results can and often do differ from these estimates. Any effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nTERMINALLING SERVICES\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into a variety of contractual obligations and other commitments. The following table summarizes the principal amount of our future minimum obligations and commitments that have remaining non-cancellable terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2016:\nOur partnership agreement requires that we categorize our capital expenditures as either expansion capital expenditures, maintenance capital expenditures or investment capital expenditures.\nThe following table presents our available liquidity as of the dates indicated:\nWe conduct our business through two distinct reporting segments: Terminalling services and Fleet services. We have established these reporting segments as strategic business units to facilitate the achievement of our long-term objectives, to assist in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance.\nDuring construction we capitalize direct costs, such as labor, materials and overhead, as well as interest cost we may incur on indebtedness at our incremental borrowing rate.\n \u2022 an increased number of railcars in service in our Fleet services business resulting from the full year operation of the Hardisty terminal. Operating income of our Fleet services business increased approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period of 2014; \nOur historical capital expenditures have primarily consisted of the costs to construct and acquire energy-related logistics assets. Our operations are expected to require investments to expand, upgrade or enhance existing facilities and to meet environmental and operational regulations.\nWe use the cash generated by our reporting segments to support our liquidity position. Our segments offer different services and are managed accordingly. Our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, regularly reviews financial information about both segments in order to allocate resources and evaluate performance. Our CODM assesses segment performance based on the cash flows produced by our established reporting segments using Segment Adjusted EBITDA. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" adjusted for changes in working capital items, changes in restricted cash, interest, income taxes, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, adjustments related to deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees and other items which do not affect the underlying cash flows produced by our businesses.\nOperating Costs\nFleet Services\n \u2022 Expansion capital expenditures are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term. Examples of expansion capital expenditures include the acquisition of terminals, rail lines and railcars or other complementary midstream assets from USD or third parties and the construction or development of new terminals or additional capacity at our existing terminals to the extent such capital expenditures are expected to expand our operating capacity or operating income. Expansion capital expenditures include interest payments (and related fees) on debt incurred to finance all or a portion of expansion capital expenditures in respect of the period from the date that we enter into a binding obligation to commence the construction, development, replacement, improvement or expansion of a capital asset and ending on the earlier to occur of the date that such capital improvement commences commercial service and the date that such capital improvement is disposed of or abandoned. \nA comprehensive discussion of our operating results by segment is presented below.\nIn mid-2016, wildfires in Alberta significantly interrupted production from nearby oil sands facilities. This meaningfully reduced crude oil supplies available to the market and effectively offset expected production growth for the year. As a result, WCS spreads remained narrow throughout 2016 as existing pipeline capacity largely met takeaway needs.\n \u2022 our ability to identify and execute accretive acquisitions and commercialize organic expansion projects to capture incremental volumes; and \nThe Term Loan Facility was used to fund a $100 million distribution to USDG in connection with the closing of our IPO and is guaranteed by USDG. The guaranty by USDG includes a covenant that USDG maintain a net worth (without taking into account its interests in us, either directly or indirectly) greater than the outstanding amount of the term loan. In the event the USDG net worth covenant is breached and not cured within a certain amount of time, the interest rate on the term loan increases by an additional 1.0%.\nterminal is contracted under multi-year, take-or-pay terminal services agreements subject to inflation-based escalators with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 2.53 years as of December 31, 2016. Furthermore, approximately 83% of the contracted capacity at our Hardisty terminal is contracted with subsidiaries of five investment grade companies. All of our counterparties are obligated to pay a minimum monthly commitment fee and can load a maximum allotted number of unit trains or barrels per month. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its maximum allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit for up to six months. This credit may be used to offset fees on throughput volumes in excess of the customer's minimum monthly commitments in future periods to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We will receive a per-barrel fee on any volumes handled in excess of the customers' maximum allowed volume, to the extent the additional volume is not subject to the credit discussed above. If a force majeure event occurs, a customer's obligation to pay us may be suspended, in which case the length of the contract term will be extended by the same duration as the force majeure event.\nbased on a predetermined formula which includes amounts collected from customers at our Hardisty terminal. We may defer recognizing portions of these costs as expense until such time that we recognize the related deferred revenue following the expiration of any make up rights provisions. Pipeline fees increased $13.6 million to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our Hardisty terminal being operational for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months of operation in 2014 when the terminal was placed into service. Our pipeline fees would have been approximately $2.7 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe believe our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in the following paragraphs address the more significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Each of these areas involve complex situations and a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates related to the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities with the Audit Committee of the board of directors of our general partner.\nOur results of operations for periods prior to our IPO included a $1.2 million management fee each year for the West Colton and San Antonio terminals. In addition, our historical selling, general and administrative costs included certain expenses allocated by our sponsor for corporate costs including insurance, professional fees, facilities, information services, human resources and other support departments, as well as direct expenses. These allocated expenses were charged or allocated to us primarily on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated evenly across the number of operating subsidiaries or allocated based on budgeted volumes or projected revenues. Our sponsor charges us a fixed annual fee for the management and operation of our assets for the provision of various centralized administrative services, as well as allocates general and administrative costs and expenses incurred by them on our behalf. In 2016, the fixed annual fee increased by approximately $0.7 million to $3.2 million, primarily as a result of hiring new employees dedicated to our services. We recently received approval from the Board of Directors to increase the fixed annual fee to $3.3 million for 2017.\nOur selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as new accounting pronouncements have been issued. Accounting decisions generally involve an interpretation of existing accounting principles and the use of judgment in applying those principles to the specific circumstances existing in our business. We make every effort to comply with all applicable accounting principles and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of these principles is critical. However, not all situations we encounter are specifically addressed in the accounting literature. In such cases, we must use our best judgment to implement accounting policies that clearly and accurately present the substance of these situations. We accomplish this by analyzing similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them and consulting with experts about the appropriate interpretation and application of the accounting literature to these situations.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $39.3 million to $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $3.1 million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the increase in net income and the net changes in working capital associated with the operations of our Hardisty terminal, which commenced operations in late June 2014 and was fully operational during the full year ended December 31, 2015. Also contributing to our operating cash flows was our acquisition of the Casper terminal, which contributed to our cash flows from the November 17, 2015 date we acquired the business.\nIn connection with our IPO, we entered into an omnibus agreement with USD and USDG, pursuant to which we were granted a right of first offer on any midstream infrastructure assets that they may develop, construct, or acquire for a period of seven years after the October 15, 2014, closing of our IPO. Additional information about the omnibus agreement and the right of first offer are included in Note 13. Transactions with Related Parties of our consolidated financial statements at Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 our liquidity and the ability of our business to produce sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders; and \nOther Expenses\nCasper Terminal Acquisition\n (1) our projections of future financial performance, which include contract renewal expectations; \nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment, including laws and regulations that govern the handling of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels. Additionally, we are subject to regulations governing railcar design and evolving regulations pertaining to the shipment of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail. Please read Item 1. Business-Impact of Regulation. Similar to other industry participants, compliance with existing and any additional environmental laws and regulations could increase our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities, or the costs of our customers, which may reduce the attractiveness of rail transportation. Our master fleet services agreements generally obligate our customers to pay for modifications and other required repairs to our leased and managed railcar fleet. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully pass all such regulatory costs on to our customers. While changes in these laws and regulations could indirectly affect Adjusted EBITDA and DCF, we believe that consumers of our services place additional value on utilizing established and reputable third-party providers to satisfy their rail terminalling and logistics needs, which may allow us to increase market share relative to customer-owned operations or smaller operators that lack an established track record of safety and regulatory compliance.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at a per annum rate by reference, at the borrowers' election, to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate or CDOR, a base rate, or Canadian prime rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin. Our borrowings under the Credit Agreement for revolving loans bear interest at either a base rate and Canadian prime rate, as applicable plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.25%, or at LIBOR or CDOR, as applicable, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.25% to 3.25%. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at either the base rate and Canadian prime rate, as applicable, plus a margin ranging from 1.35% to 2.35% or at LIBOR or CDOR, as applicable, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.35% to 3.35%. The applicable margin, as well as a commitment fee on the Revolving Credit Facility, ranging from 0.375% per annum to 0.50% per annum on unused commitments, will vary based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in our Credit Agreement. The actual average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness was 3.66% and 2.71% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe Net loss associated with our corporate activities increased by $8.7 million to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.2 million, primarily due to incremental unit based compensation expense associated with the additional Phantom Units granted in February 2016 to directors and employees of our general partner and its affiliates under our Long-Term Incentive Plan. Unit based compensation expense also increased due to a higher closing price for our common units on the NYSE at December 31, 2016, compared with the closing price at December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expense also increased due to the annual adjustment of the management fee we are charged by affiliates of USDG pursuant to the omnibus agreement. Interest expense was the greatest contributor to the increases in corporate activity costs, which increased by $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a higher average balance outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility resulting from amounts we borrowed for our acquisition of the Casper terminal, as well as higher average rates of interest relative to the same period in 2015. We recognized a provision for income taxes of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting primarily of a provision for Texas state franchise tax of USD Partners LP.\nIn 2016, prior to filing our 2015 Canadian tax returns, we adopted a methodology for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries based upon completion of a study we initially commissioned in 2015. The methodology we adopted for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries supported by this study resulted in a reduction of our Canadian income tax liability for the 2015 tax year, as reflected in the Canadian income\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\ntax returns we filed in 2016. The resulting decrease in our Canadian income tax liability was reflected in our 2016 income statement as a reduction to our 2016 provision for income taxes. We have also reduced our provision for income taxes in 2016 for the lower expected Canadian income tax liability we anticipate for 2016 as a result of the methodology we adopted for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries.\nGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is only included in our Terminalling services segment.\n (3) Represents foreign exchange transaction gains or losses associated with activities between our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. \n (3) A range of EBITDA multiples derived from stock prices of public companies with similar operating and investment characteristics, from 9x to 10x; and \nThe following discussion relates to the critical accounting policies and estimates for both USD Partners LP and our Predecessor. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. The following accounting policies are considered critical because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events, some over which we may have little or no control. Significant estimates by management include the estimated lives of depreciable property and equipment, recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, and provision and deferral of income taxes.\nOur sponsor is currently pursuing several development projects related to the storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels. These development projects are expected to be supported by long-term take-or-pay\nRefer to Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for a discussion regarding recent accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted.\nOur exposure to credit risk may be affected by the concentration of customers, as well as changes in economic or other conditions. Our customers' businesses react differently to changing conditions. We believe that our credit-review procedures, loss reserves, customer deposits and collection procedures have adequately provided for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future.\nShelf Registration Statement\nWe are not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes or for a majority of the states that impose an income tax. Taxes on our net income are generally borne by our unitholders through the allocation of taxable income, except for USD Rail LP, which, on October 7, 2014, elected to be classified as an entity taxable as a corporation. Our income tax expense is predominantly attributable to Canadian federal and provincial income taxes imposed on our operations based in Canada. Additionally, we are subject to state income tax laws that apply to entities organized as partnerships by the State of Texas. This state income tax is computed on our modified gross margin, which we have determined to be an income tax as set forth in the authoritative accounting guidance. Our current and historical provision for income taxes also reflects income taxes associated with USD Rail LP.\nPipeline fees. We incur pipeline fees related to a facilities connection agreement with Gibson for the delivery of crude oil from Gibson's storage terminal to our Hardisty terminal via pipeline. The pipeline fees paid to Gibson are\n \u2022 Consolidated Leverage Ratio of not greater than 4.50 to 1.00 (or 5.00 to 1.00 at any time after we have issued at least $150.0 million of unsecured notes). In addition, upon the consummation of a Material Acquisition (as defined in our Credit Agreement), for the fiscal quarter in which the Material Acquisition is consummated and for two fiscal quarters immediately following such fiscal quarter (the Material Acquisition Period\u201d), if elected by us by written notice to the Administrative Agent given on or prior to the date of such acquisition, the maximum permitted ratio shall be increased by 0.50 to 1.00 above the otherwise relevant level; and \nVolumes\nProvision for income taxes. A significant amount of our operating income is generated by our Hardisty terminal, which is located in the Canadian province of Alberta. As a Canadian business, operating income from our Hardisty terminal is subject to corporate income tax rates enacted by the Canadian federal and provincial governments, which on a combined basis have increased effective July 1, 2015, from 25% to 26% of taxable income for the entirety of 2015, and which increased further to 27% beginning January 1, 2016. Our provision for income taxes for the Terminalling services segment was $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with $47 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014, partially as a result of these recently enacted tax rate changes. The increase is primarily attributable to the current and deferred income taxes associated with our Hardisty terminal operations, which commenced operations in late June 2014 and did not generate taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue generated by our Terminalling services segment increased $42.0 million to $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to our Hardisty terminal being operational for the entire twelve months in the year ended December 31, 2015, whereas during the year ended December 31, 2014, the terminal operations commenced in late June 2014. Also\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $17.0 million to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the additional depreciation and amortization expense associated with our Casper terminal which we acquired in November 2015. In addition, we incurred a non-cash impairment loss of $3.5 million, in connection with the expected May 1,\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nWe generate substantially all of our operating cash flow from multi-year, take-or-pay contracts for crude oil terminalling services, such as railcar loading for transportation to end markets, storage and blending in on-site tanks, as well as related logistics services. We do not take ownership of the products that we handle nor do we receive any payments from our customers based on the value of such products. We believe rail will continue as an important transportation option for energy producers, refiners and marketers due to its unique advantages relative to other transportation means. Specifically, rail transportation of energy-related products provides flexible access to key demand centers on a relatively low fixed-cost basis with faster physical delivery, while preserving the specific quality of customer products over long distances.\nparty administrative services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue for reimbursable costs is recognized as the costs are incurred. We have deferred revenues for amounts collected from customers in our Fleet services segment, which will be recognized as revenue when earned pursuant to the contractual terms. We have prepaid rent associated with these deferred revenues on our railcar leases, which will be recognized as expense when incurred.\n \u2022 our customers' utilization of our terminals in excess of their minimum monthly volume commitments; \n (3) Represents deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees in excess of throughput utilized, which fees are not refundable to our customers. Amounts presented are net of: (a) the corresponding prepaid Gibson pipeline fee that will be recognized as expense concurrently with the recognition of revenue; (b) revenue recognized in the current period that was previously deferred; and (c) expense recognized for previously prepaid Gibson pipeline fees, which correspond with the revenue recognized that was previously deferred. Refer to the discussion in Note 10. Deferred Revenue of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. \nOur historical results of operations include revenues and expenses related to (i) the construction of our Hardisty terminal, (ii) the operation of our San Antonio and West Colton terminals, (iii) our railcar fleet services throughout North America and (iv) the operations of our Hardisty terminal, which commenced in late June 2014. Costs incurred in the Predecessor periods with respect to the Hardisty terminal are primarily related to pre-operational activities.\nThe EBITDA multiples from executed purchase and sales transactions of businesses that are similar to our Casper terminal reporting unit we used to estimate the fair value are also subject to variability, which is dependent upon market conditions in the energy sector, as well as the perceived benefits the acquiring entity expects to derive from the transaction. The transactions comprising the pool occurred during the immediately preceding two years and future transactions may have no correlation to the EBITDA multiples for similar transactions in the future. Further deterioration in economic conditions in the energy sector could result in a greater number of distressed sales at lower EBITDA multiples than currently estimated. Additionally, a representative sample of transactions in the future may not provide\nRevenues\nChanges in environmental and gasoline blending regulations may affect the use of ethanol in the market for transportation fuel. Due to corrosion concerns unique to biofuels, such as ethanol, the long-haul transportation of biofuels via multi-product pipelines is less efficient and less economical than rail. Rail also helps aggregate fragmented ethanol production across the country. In the event that dedicated pipelines are constructed, or additional technologies are developed to allow for more economical transportation of biofuels on multi-product pipelines, demand for transportation of biofuels by rail may be impacted.\nThe volume of crude oil and biofuels that we handle at our terminals and the number of railcars we provide and perform railcar-specific fleet services for ultimately depends on refining and blending margins. Refining and blending margins are dependent mostly upon the price of crude oil or other refinery feedstocks and the price of refined products. These prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including the global supply and demand for crude oil and gasoline and other refined products. The supply of crude oil will depend on numerous factors, including commodity pricing, improvements in extractive technology, environmental regulation and other factors. We believe that our Adjusted EBITDA and DCF will not be impacted in the near term to the extent of our multi-year, take-or-pay terminal services agreements. However, our ability to grow through expansion or acquisitions and our ability to renew or extend our terminal services agreements could be impacted by a long-term reduction in supply or demand.\nCredit Agreement\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nWe intend to make minimum quarterly distributions of at least $0.2875 per common unit ($1.15 per unit on an annualized basis) to the extent we have sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to our general partner. We intend to pay distributions no later than 60 days after the end of each quarter. We paid our most recent distribution on February 17, 2017, at a rate of $0.33 per common unit ($1.32 per unit on an annualized basis) for the quarter ending December 31, 2016, to unitholders of record on February 13, 2017.\n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. \nWestern Canadian crude oil production is projected to increase throughout the next decade, driven primarily by developments in Alberta's oil sands region. In June 2016, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers projected that the supply of crude oil from Western Canada will grow by approximately 590,000 Bpd by 2020 and 890,000 Bpd by 2025 relative to 2015. Since then, several companies have announced plans to increase production capacity at their oil sands facilities, in part due to cost savings and optimization achieved during the recent commodity price downturn.\nFrom December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the exchange rate, representing the midpoint of the range between the bid and ask prices, between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar decreased from 0.8621 to 0.7210 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. This change in the exchange rate increased the value of our derivative contracts at\n (2) Represents costs incurred with respect to unrecovered reimbursable freight costs associated with the initial delivery of railcars in support of our Hardisty terminal. \nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nto payments from customers under master fleet services agreements associated with specific railcars, together with our obligations to make rental payments to the owners of the railcars, to related parties of USD. The assignment of these rights to receive payments under the master fleet services agreements and our obligations to make payments under the associated leases reduced the amount of lease revenue we otherwise would have recognized, and similarly reduced the lease costs as discussed below under operating costs.\nOur sponsor expects that these industry dynamics will contribute to growing demand for storage, staging, blending, export and other logistics services along the Gulf Coast, including at its Houston Ship Channel property. Accordingly, our sponsor is actively engaged in commercial negotiations with potential customers to provide solutions for both crude oil and refined products.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP:\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\nthese assets. We expect our expenses to remain relatively stable, but they may fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during a period and the timing of these expenditures.\nPrior to July 1, 2016, a member of the board of directors of USD exercised control over the VIEs, resulting in these entities being classified as related parties during that period. Related party sales to the special purpose entities were $0.8 million, $1.9 million and $1.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These sales are recorded in \"Fleet services-related party\" on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue generated by our Terminalling services segment increased $35.5 million to $100.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.This increase was largely due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in mid-November of 2015, which provided an additional $28.1 million of revenue to our Terminalling services business in 2016. In addition, due to inflation-indexed rate escalations associated with our terminalling services agreements for our Hardisty terminal, we recognized more revenue for 2016 than we recognized during 2015, partially offset by additional amounts we deferred. Our terminalling services revenue was also affected by the decline in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Our terminalling services revenue would have been approximately $2.3 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following table sets forth the operating results of our Fleet services business for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nOperating and maintenance. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $0.9 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our acquisition of the Casper terminal.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nHardisty Terminal Services Agreements. We have entered into terminal services agreements with seven high-quality, primarily investment grade counterparties or their subsidiaries: Cenovus Energy, Gibson, J. Aron & Company, Phillips 66, Suncor Energy, Total and USD Marketing LLC. Substantially all of the terminalling capacity at our Hardisty\nFinancing Activities\nOther Expenses\n \u2022 a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $3.5 million we recognized in connection with winding down our San Antonio Terminal operations, including an asset retirement obligation of $1.0 million for amounts we expect to spend to restore the property to its original condition; \n2017 termination of our customer contract for ethanol transloading services at our San Antonio terminal, including an asset retirement obligation of $1.0 million for amounts we expect to spend to restore the property to its original condition.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for our Terminalling services segment decreased by $1.0 million to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the lower average outstanding balance of our Term Loan Facility during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2015.\nUnder the terminal services agreements we have entered into with customers of our Hardisty terminal, our customers are obligated to pay the greater of a minimum monthly commitment fee or a throughput fee based on the actual volume of crude oil loaded at our Hardisty terminal. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its maximum allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit for up to six months to offset fees on throughput in excess of their minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We record the portion of customer payments in excess of amounts paid for volumes actually shipped as deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet. Lower throughput volumes do not affect our Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, or our ability to pay our minimum quarterly distribution, since such deferred revenues do not affect our cash flow. We typically recognize as revenue any amounts we have deferred within six months when these make-up rights\u201d are either used or expire. The utilization or expiration of make-up rights will not affect our cash flows since the fees associated with such volumes were previously collected. Additional discussion regarding make-up rights and deferred revenues is included in Note 10. Deferred Revenues to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.\nIn November 2015, we amended our Credit Agreement to increase our total borrowing capacity from $300 million to $400 million, while all other terms and conditions of the existing Credit Agreement remained unchanged. We also reset our ability to request an additional $100 million of incremental Revolving Credit Facility commitments, subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders or other financial institutions and satisfaction of certain conditions.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is considered impaired when the sum of the estimated, undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Factors that indicate potential impairment include: a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset, and a significant change in the asset's physical condition or use.\nForeign Currency\nWe conduct our business through two distinct reporting segments: Terminalling services and Fleet services. We have established these reporting segments as strategic business units to facilitate the achievement of our long-term objectives, to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance.\n\n \u2022 non-cash losses associated with the revaluation of our foreign currency derivative instruments as compared with gains in the prior year due to a more stable exchange rate between the U.S. and Canada; and \nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF in this report provides information that enhances an investor's understanding of our ability to generate cash for payment of distributions and other purposes. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and DCF is \"Net cash provided by operating activities\". Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered an alternative to \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" or any other measure of liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF exclude some, but not all, items that affect cash from operations and these measures may vary among other companies. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nFreight and other reimbursables costs. Freight and other reimbursables costs decreased $0.6 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulting from a decrease in the costs for the delivery and shipment of railcars associated with the startup of our Hardisty terminal that occurred in 2014, partially offset by additional repairs and maintenance costs we incurred and passed through to our customers. Freight and other reimbursables costs were exactly offset by Freight and other reimbursables revenues.\nDebt Service\nThe $400 million Credit Agreement is comprised of a $300 million Revolving Credit Facility, and a $100 million Term Loan Facility (borrowed in Canadian dollars), with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The Credit Agreement is a five year committed facility that matures October 15, 2019, unless amended or extended.\nAssumptions we make under the income approach include our projections of future financial performance of the Casper terminal reporting unit, which include contract renewal expectations and commitments regarding the use of these facilities. To the extent that our assumptions for contract renewals and customer commitments vary from what we experience in the future, our projections of future financial performance underlying the fair value derived from the income approach of the Casper terminal reporting unit could yield results that are significantly different from those produced.\nagreements with strategic customers which would generate stable and predictable cash flows. Energy Capital Partners has indicated an intention to invest an additional $1.0 billion of equity capital in USD, subject to market and other conditions, to support future growth and expansion plans.\nRailroad Incentive Payments\n \u2022 declines in our fleet services business resulting from reductions to the number of railcars in our fleet; \nNet income for financial statement purposes may differ significantly from taxable income of unitholders as a result of differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and the taxable income allocation requirements under our partnership agreement. The aggregate difference in the basis of our net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined because information regarding each partner's tax attributes in us is not available.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nTerminalling Services Revenue\nRegulatory Environment\nWe incurred $238 thousand of maintenance capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily at our Casper terminal for environmental monitoring and security equipment. We had no maintenance capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We record routine maintenance expenses we incur in connection with the operation of our assets in \"Operating and maintenance\" expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $16.9 million to $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $36.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the cash flows produced by our Casper terminal, which we acquired in November 2015. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was partially offset by net changes in our working capital accounts resulting from the timing of receipts and payment of our accounts receivable and payable balances, as well as the increase in our restricted cash balances.\nWestern Canada\nCORPORATE ACTIVITIES\nFinancing\nOur benefit from income taxes for the Terminalling services segment was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with a provision for income taxes of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2016, prior to filing our 2015 Canadian tax returns, we adopted a methodology for determining the return attributable to the activities of our foreign subsidiaries based on the functions we provide and risks we manage on their behalf, which resulted in a reduction of our Canadian income tax liabilities for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. The resulting reduction of our Canadian income tax liabilities for 2015 was reflected as a decrease to our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in a net benefit from income taxes for 2016. We utilized net operating losses relating to our Canadian terminalling business during 2015, to the extent available, to offset Canadian taxable income generated in 2015. For 2016, we have no operating loss carryforwards available to apply towards future ordinary taxable income derived from our Canadian terminalling business.\nPursuant to the authoritative accounting guidance regarding uncertain tax positions, we recognize the tax effects of any uncertain tax position as the largest amount that will more likely than not be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority having full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Under this criterion, we evaluate the most likely resolution of an uncertain tax position based on its technical merits and on the outcome that we expect would likely be sustained under examination.\nWe anticipate using the cash flows generated by our Canadian subsidiaries to repay borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and borrowing up to the U.S. dollar equivalent amount under our Revolving Credit Facility, as necessary, to fund distributions to our unitholders. Following repayment of our Term Loan Facility and absent the incurrence of additional Canadian debt, we anticipate utilizing any excess cash flows produced by our Canadian subsidiaries to repay amounts they have borrowed from our U.S. entities, including us. Any amounts distributed by our Canadian subsidiaries to us in order to partially fund distributions to our unitholders, which are in excess of amounts they have borrowed from us, would be subject to Canadian withholding taxes.\nRight of First Offer\n (1) Corporate activities represent corporate and financing transactions that are not allocated to our established reporting segments. \nWe continue to proactively manage our operating costs in an effort to align with the current business environment, which may result in additional cost savings over the near term. However, we do not expect these benefits to remain over the long term as market and economic conditions improve.\nEnergy Capital Partners must approve any additional issuances of equity by us, which determinations may be made free of any duty to us or our unitholders. Members of our general partner's board of directors appointed by Energy Capital Partners must also approve the incurrence by us of additional indebtedness or refinancing outside of our existing indebtedness that is not in the ordinary course of business.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had amounts outstanding for the respective periods of $10.1 million and $41.5 million under the Term Loan Facility and $213.0 million and $201.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014, were largely driven by the following:\nThe approximately $33.6 million balance of our goodwill originated from our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015 and is wholly attributed to this reporting unit. We measured the fair value of our Casper terminal reporting unit using customary business valuation techniques including an income analysis, market analysis and transaction analysis, which we weighted at 50%, 25% and 25%, respectively. The critical assumptions used in our analysis include the following:\n (1) Represents foreign exchange transaction amounts associated with activities between our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. \nRevenues from our Fleet services segment decreased $6.2 million to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the number of railcars directly leased by us to our customers, which also resulted in a $5.7 million decrease in Fleet leases, a corresponding $0.5 million decrease in Fleet services, and no notable changes in Freight and other reimbursables revenue. The Freight and other reimbursables revenues represent customer reimbursements to us for freight and other charges that we have incurred on behalf of our customers and were exactly offset by Freight and other reimbursables costs.\nCertain end users, including refineries across North America, have made substantial investments in recent years in order to efficiently process heavy grades of crude oil, such as those from Western Canada. Even with recent regulatory approvals, additions to pipeline takeaway capacity are not expected to keep pace with production growth over the next several years. As a result, multiple industry forecasts project demand for rail takeaway solutions will increase in 2017 and 2018. Our Hardisty and Casper terminals, with established capacity and scalable designs, are well-positioned as strategic locations to meet expected future takeaway needs.\nOperating costs of our fleet services segment increased $0.8 million to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in Fleet leases costs for our direct leases of railcars made on behalf of our customers, partially offset by decreases in Freight and other reimbursables and Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nGrowth Opportunities for our Operations\nRevenues for Terminalling services are recognized when services are provided based on the contractual rates related to throughput volumes. Our terminalling services agreements typically contain take-or-pay\u201d provisions whereby we are entitled to a minimum monthly commitment fee. In accordance with the terms of these agreements, we recognize the portions of these minimum monthly commitment fees paid for volumes in excess of actual throughput when the customer's ability to make up the minimum volume has expired, the throughput is utilized or when it is determined that the likelihood that the customer will utilize the make-up rights is remote. Revenue for Fleet services and related\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe following table summarizes our operating results by business segment and corporate charges for each of the years indicated:\n \u2022 a full year of costs related to our omnibus agreement and public partnership expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, that we did not incur prior to our IPO in October 2014; and \n (2) Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases for land, building, track, and railcars. \nA substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Canada and are accounted for in the local currency, the Canadian dollar, which we translate into our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. We translate most Canadian dollar denominated balance sheet accounts at the end of period exchange rate, while most income statement accounts are translated monthly based on the average exchange rate for each monthly period. Amounts translated from foreign currencies into our U.S. dollar reporting currency can vary between periods due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar.\nWe have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission which allows us to issue up to $500 million in aggregate offering price of common units, preferred units\nWestern Canadian crude oil production is projected to increase throughout the next decade, driven primarily by developments in Alberta's oil sands region. In June 2016, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers projected that the supply of crude oil from Western Canada will grow by approximately 590,000 Bpd by 2020 and 890,000 Bpd by 2025 relative to 2015. Since then, several companies have announced plans to increase production capacity at their oil sands facilities, in part due to cost savings and optimization achieved during the recent commodity price downturn.\nOur primary requirements for capital are for funding capital expenditures, including acquisitions and the costs we may incur to construct new assets, servicing our debt and making distributions to our unitholders.\nRevenues from our Fleet services segment increased $3.7 million to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet leases associated with the Hardisty terminal being in service for the full year in 2015 and only one-half of the year in 2014, coupled with additional fleet services revenue resulting from railcar management services provided to affiliates of USD.", "item_7_text": " \u2022 the Casper terminal operations, which we acquired in November 2015, contributed approximately $0.8 million to the operating income of our Terminalling services business; \nDistributions\n\nDemand for Rail Transportation of Crude Oil and Biofuels\nFleet leases. Fleet leases revenue increased $3.0 million to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in railcars directly leased by us to our customers. Our lease revenue is directly correlated with the number of railcars we have leased to customers. We directly leased an average of approximately 650 railcars to our customers for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with approximately 600 railcars for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2014, we assigned our rights\nAs of March 3, 2017, we had $214.0 million drawn on our Revolving Credit Facility and C$3.6 million (representing $2.8 million) outstanding under our Term Loan Facility in relation to the balances presented at December 31, 2016, in our consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the borrowings we have made under the terms of our Credit Agreement, our interest expense in 2016 exceeded amounts incurred in 2015 and 2014.\nRefer to Note 23. Subsequent events of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for a discussion regarding our subsequent events.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants set forth in our Credit Agreement.\nWe plan to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions that will provide attractive returns to our unitholders, including energy-related logistics assets related to the storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels, from both USD and third parties. We intend to leverage our industry relationships and market knowledge to successfully execute on such opportunities, which we may pursue independently or jointly with USD. We have entered into an omnibus agreement with USD and USD Group LLC, pursuant to which USD Group LLC has granted us a right of first offer on any midstream infrastructure assets that they may develop, construct, or acquire for a period of seven years after the October 15, 2014, closing of our IPO. Additional information regarding our growth opportunities is discussed in Item 1. Business-Future Growth Opportunities and information regarding the omnibus agreement is presented in Note 13. Transactions with Related Parties-Omnibus Agreement of Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data. We cannot assure you that USD will be able to develop or construct, or that we or USD will be able to acquire, any other midstream infrastructure projects, including any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal. Among other things, the ability of USD to further develop the Hardisty terminal, or any other project, and our ability to acquire such projects, will depend upon USD's and our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing. We are under no obligation to make any offer, and USD and USD Group LLC are under no obligation to accept any offer we make, with respect to any asset subject to our right of first offer. Additionally, the approval of Energy Capital Partners is required for the sale of any assets by USD or its subsidiaries, including us (other than sales in the ordinary course of business), acquisitions of securities of other entities that exceed specified materiality thresholds and any material unbudgeted expenditures or deviations from our approved budget. Energy Capital Partners may make these decisions free of any duty to us and our unitholders. This approval would be required for the potential acquisition by us of any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal, as well as any other projects or assets that USD may develop or acquire in the future or any third party acquisition we may pursue independently or jointly with USD. Energy Capital Partners is under no obligation to approve any such transaction. Additional discussion of the special approval rights of Energy Capital Partners is included in Item\nOverview and Recent Developments\nOur management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations by effectively managing operating and maintenance expenses. Given that both our Hardisty and Casper terminals were constructed in 2014, we do not expect to incur significant maintenance expenditures in the near term to maintain the operating capacity of these facilities. We record routine maintenance expenses associated with operating our assets in \"Operating and maintenance\" costs in our consolidated statements of operations. Our operating and maintenance expenses are comprised primarily of pipeline fees, repairs and maintenance expenses, materials and supplies, subcontracted rail expenses, utility costs, insurance premiums and rent for facilities and equipment. In addition, our operating expenses include the cost of leasing railcars from third-party railcar suppliers and the shipping fees charged by railroads, which costs are generally passed through to our customers. Although our assets are relatively new, we expect to incur costs to maintain these assets in compliance with sound business practices, our contractual relationships and to comply with regulatory requirements for operating\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur Credit Agreement generally prohibits us from making cash distributions (subject to exceptions as set forth in the Credit Agreement) except so long as no default exists or would be caused thereby, we may make cash distributions to unitholders up to the amount of our available cash (as defined in our partnership agreement).\n (4) Represents deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees in excess of throughput utilized, which fees are not refundable to the customers. Amounts presented are net of: (a) the corresponding prepaid Gibson pipeline fee that will be recognized as expense concurrently with the recognition of revenue; (b) revenue recognized in the current period that was previously deferred; and (c) expense recognized for previously prepaid Gibson pipeline fees, which correspond with the revenue recognized that was previously deferred. Refer to the discussion in Note 10. Deferred revenue of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. \nWe define Distributable Cash Flow, or DCF, as Adjusted EBITDA less net cash paid for interest, income taxes and maintenance capital expenditures. DCF does not reflect changes in working capital balances. DCF is a non-GAAP, supplemental financial measure used by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nDepreciation. Our Fleet services segment does not own any significant amounts of property upon which to record depreciation expense and, as a result, did not incur depreciation expense for either of the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nOur operating results for periods after November 17, 2015, include the revenues and costs associated with our operation of the Casper terminal, which we acquired on this date.\nCapitalization Policies and Depreciation Methods\nInvesting Activities\n\n (1) These future obligations represent labor service agreements at our terminal facilities. \nWe are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by USD to acquire, develop and operate energy-related logistics assets, including rail terminals and other high-quality and complementary midstream infrastructure. Our principal assets consist of: (i) a crude oil origination terminal in Hardisty, Alberta, Canada, with capacity to load up to two 120-railcar unit trains per day, (ii) a crude oil terminal in Casper, Wyoming, with unit train-capable railcar loading capacity in excess of 100,000 barrels per day, or Bpd, and six customer-dedicated storage tanks with 900,000 barrels, or Bbls, of total capacity and (iii) two unit train-capable ethanol destination terminals in San Antonio, Texas, and West Colton, California. Our terminals provide critical infrastructure allowing our customers to transport energy-related products from multiple supply regions to numerous demand markets that are dependent on these products. In addition, we provide our customers with railcars and fleet services related to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail under multi-year, take-or-pay contracts. As of December 31, 2016, our railcar fleet consisted of 2,953 railcars, which we leased from various railcar manufacturers and financial entities, including 2,108 coiled and insulated, or C&I, railcars.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 a contribution of approximately $10.2 million derived from the Casper terminal operations we acquired in November 2015, partially offset by the additional interest expense we incurred on amounts borrowed for the acquisition; \nThe increase in our losses associated with our corporate activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily relates to an increase in selling, general and administrative costs and interest expense. Selling, general and administrative costs include unit based compensation expense attributable to Class A units which were granted in October 2014 and Phantom units awarded in February 2015 under our Long-term Incentive Plan, in addition to amounts we are charged pursuant to the terms of our omnibus agreement with USDG, which we entered into in October 2014 at the closing of our IPO. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, was higher than that for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the new borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in the current year.\nWe expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include borrowings under our $400 million Credit Agreement, issuances of additional debt and equity securities either privately or pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement, as well as cash we generate from our operating activities. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions.\nDeferred Revenues Generated from Our Hardisty Operations\nFleet leases. Fleet leases revenue decreased $5.7 million to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a reduction in the number of railcars directly leased by us for our customers. We directly leased an average of approximately 350 railcars in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately 650 railcars in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our fleet lease revenues were offset by slightly more costs we incurred to lease railcars from our lessors than we received in lease revenue due to excess mileage we agreed to pay on behalf of a customer.\n (4) an expected range of EBITDA multiples for transactions based on actual sales and purchases of comparable businesses. \n (4) A range of EBITDA multiples for transactions based on actual sales and purchases of comparable businesses, from 8.5x to 9.5x. \nRevenues\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nLoss associated with derivative instruments. In June 2015 and April 2016, we entered into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, specifically between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, related to operations at our Hardisty terminal. We record all of our derivative financial instruments at fair market value in our consolidated financial statements, which we adjust each period for changes in the fair market value, or mark to market.\n (2) our expected market weighted average cost of capital; \n\nFleet leases costs. Fleet leases costs increased $3.0 million to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in direct leases we entered for railcars that we in turn provide to our customers. A majority of the increase in railcars we leased during 2015 were for a related party of USD. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we directly leased an average of approximately 650 railcars as compared with approximately 600 for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2014, we assigned our obligations to make payments under certain railcar leases and master fleet services agreements to related parties of USD. The assignment of these obligations to make lease payments reduced the amount of lease costs we otherwise would have recognized, which is similar in amount to the reduction in lease revenue as discussed above.\nRevenues are derived from railcar loading and offloading services for bulk liquid products including crude oil, biofuels, and related products, as well as sourcing railcar fleets and related logistics and maintenance services. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the buyer's price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition, we record revenues for Fleet services on a gross basis when we are deemed the primary obligor for the services. We also record revenues from reimbursable costs on a gross basis as reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses are included in revenues and operating costs.\nOur operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015, were largely driven by the following:\nWith additional volumes of crude oil handled at our Hardisty and Casper terminals, we expect to incur additional operating costs, including subcontracted rail services and pipeline fees.\nHistorically, we have received incentive payments from railroads in connection with large capital projects that are projected to create incremental traffic on their networks. With respect to our Hardisty terminal, we have the right to receive incentive payments based on the number of railcars loaded for certain customers through mid-2017. A portion of these payments increases the pipeline fees payable to Gibson. We recognized revenue of approximately $0.4 million and $0.7 million for railroad incentive payments during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in connection with the operation of our Hardisty terminal. The decline in these payments is partially due to a decrease in the number of railcars loaded in 2015 as compared with 2014, coupled with the decline in the average exchange rate for Canadian dollars in relation to U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2015.\n (2) A capital structure consisting of approximately 35% debt and 65% equity; \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Net cash provided by operating activities:\nFLEET SERVICES\n \u2022 a reduction in our income taxes resulting from a methodology we adopted for determining the return attributable to the activities of our foreign subsidiaries based on the functions we provide and risks we manage on their behalf, which resulted in a reduction of our Canadian income tax liabilities for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. \nOur total expansion capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $0.5 million and were for planned growth projects at our Hardisty and Casper terminals. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our total expansion capital expenditures were $212.1 million and were primarily for our acquisition of the Casper terminal coupled with enhancements made to our Hardisty terminal to increase load pressure and provide for alternative power sources to keep the terminal operational in the event of a power loss. We expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash on our balance sheet, cash flow generated from our operations, borrowing on our Revolving Credit Facility, the issuance of additional partnership interests or long-term debt.\nAdjusted EBITDA from our Fleet services segment decreased $0.6 million to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in 2016 is primarily the result of a reduction in the total number of railcars in our fleet from which we generate cash for providing services primarily in support of customers of our terminals. In 2015, the number of railcars in our fleet was greater than in 2014, thus producing more cash from the services provided.\nWhen alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long-lived asset are under consideration, estimates of future undiscounted cash flows take into account possible outcomes and probabilities of their occurrence. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset.\nThe following table and discussion presents a summary of cash flows associated with our operating, investing and financing activities for the specified periods.\nThe Credit Agreement contains events of default, including, but not limited to (and subject to grace periods in circumstances set forth in the Credit Agreement), the failure to pay any principal, interest or fees when due, failure to perform or observe any covenant that does not have certain materiality qualifiers contained in the Credit Agreement or related loan documentation, any representation, warranty or certification made or deemed made in the agreements or related loan documentation being untrue in any material respect when made, default under certain material debt agreements, commencement of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, certain changes in our ownership or the ownership of our general partner, material judgments or orders, certain judgment defaults, ERISA events or the invalidity of the loan documents. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the agreements, the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments, declare any outstanding loans to be immediately due and payable and/or exercise remedies against us and the collateral as may be available to the lenders under the agreements and related documentation or applicable law.\n\nFor example, Canadian Natural recently announced plans to reinstate the development of the 40,000 Bpd Kirby North project and the evaluation of an opportunity to debottleneck the Horizon fractionation tower during upcoming turnaround work, in order to increase production by 5,000 to 15,000 Bpd. Cenovus announced plans to resume construction on its 50,000 Bpd Christina Lake Phase G project and is advancing engineering work on two previously deferred expansion projects that total 75,000 Bpd of expected design capacity. MEG Energy announced an initiative at its Christina Lake Phase 2B project that is expected to increase production by approximately 20,000 Bpd. Consistent with these trends, our partner, Gibson Energy, recently commissioned ahead of schedule 2.9 million barrels of incremental storage capacity at the Hardisty hub, representing a nearly 50% increase. Gibson successfully secured short term contracts to utilize the tanks, as necessary, until the long-term take-or-pay contracts commence later in 2017.\nOur business is subject to the risk that we will not be able to renew, extend or replace our customer contracts as their terms expire. Each of the seven terminalling services agreements with our Hardisty terminal customers has an initial contract term of five years and expires in 2019. The initial term of six of these agreements commenced between June 30, 2014 and August 1, 2014, and the initial term of a seventh agreement commenced on October 1, 2014. The three terminalling services agreements with our Casper terminal customers have initial contract terms expiring in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Our sole customer contract for our San Antonio terminal has a term expiring in May 2017, and we anticipate that this customer will not renew or extend this contract further as it moves its business to a new wholly-owned terminal it is constructing. Our sole customer contract for our West Colton terminal is with the same customer at our San Antonio terminal and is terminable at any time by either party upon 150 days' notice.\nWe currently derive a significant portion of our cash flow from our Canadian operations, particularly our Hardisty\n \u2022 a full year of operation of our Hardisty terminal, which commenced operation in late June 2014 and contributed approximately $23.1 million to the operating income of our Terminalling services business for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with a contribution of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014; \nSubcontracted rail services. We subcontract a majority of the services related to the operations of our terminals, which costs are primarily fixed. These subcontracted rail services costs increased $0.4 million to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the additional costs for these services incurred at our Casper terminal, which contributed approximately $2.8 million more to these costs, partially offset by a decrease in costs at our Hardisty terminal, due to a decrease in the number of railcars loaded in 2016 as compared with 2015.\nForeign currency transaction loss Our Terminalling services segment recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to the routine settlement of intercompany transactions associated with the operations of our Hardisty terminal. Foreign currency transaction losses of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulted from settlement of U.S. dollar denominated bank debt in periods prior to our IPO and the recapitalization transactions completed in contemplation of our IPO, as well as routine transactions with external customers.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to incremental costs associated with our management and operation of the Casper terminal.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe operating costs of our Terminalling services segment increased $17.5 million to $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to our Hardisty terminal being operational for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months of operation in 2014 when the terminal was placed into service. Also contributing to the increase in operating expenses in 2015 is the addition of the Casper terminal in mid-November, which added $3.0 million of operating expenses. Our operating expenses would have been approximately $4.8 million dollars greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015 was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTerminalling Services Revenue\n \u2022 the sustainability of our current distribution rate per unit. \nOperating Activities\n \u2022 Investment capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that are neither maintenance capital expenditures nor expansion capital expenditures. Investment capital expenditures will largely consist of capital expenditures made for investment purposes. Examples of investment capital expenditures include traditional capital expenditures for investment purposes, such as purchases of securities, as well as other capital expenditures that might be made in lieu of such traditional investment capital expenditures, such as the acquisition of a capital asset for investment purposes or development of facilities that are in excess of the maintenance of our existing operating capacity or operating income, but that are not expected to expand our operating capacity or operating income over the long term. \n \u2022 Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), of at least 2.50 to 1.00; \nWe generate substantially all of our operating cash flow by charging fixed fees for handling energy-related products and providing related services. We do not take ownership of the underlying products that we handle nor do we receive any payments from our customers based on the value of such products. Thus, we have no direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices, although these risks could indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long term.\nDecember 31, 2015, relative to the value at December 31, 2014, producing a gain of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWorldwide consumption of liquid fuels is estimated to have increased by over one million barrels per day in 2016 and is projected to increase by another three million barrels per day by 2018. Recent industry developments highlight the Gulf Coast's strategic importance within global energy markets and ability to meet growing demand. Exports of crude oil from PADD 3 have increased more than twenty percent since the lifting of the export ban in December 2015. Additionally, PADD 3 exports of petroleum products have increased ten percent over the last year and thirty-five percent over the last two years. Finally, given expected growth in Permian Basin crude oil production, industry participants have announced plans to add more than 600,000 Bpd of pipeline capacity to transport crude oil from West Texas to the Houston refining and distribution hub for domestic consumption or export to other markets.\n (1) A weighted average cost of capital of 10%; \npaid cash distributions of $29.7 million and repaid the equivalent of $33.6 million on our Term Loan Facility (representing C$44.0 million) and $8.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $20.0 million we received from borrowing on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur Hardisty terminal is subject to Canadian income taxes that result from taxable income generated by our Canadian operations and withholding taxes that are applicable to certain distributions from our Canadian subsidiaries. Prior to commencing operations in late June 2014, our Hardisty terminal did not generate any taxable income, but produced net operating losses that were available to reduce future Canadian provincial and federal taxable income. We utilized net operating losses relating to our Canadian terminalling business during the second half of 2014 and for 2015, to the extent available, to offset Canadian taxable income generated during these periods. The combined Canadian federal and provincial income tax rate was 25% prior to the income tax rate increase enacted by the Canadian province of Alberta in June 2015, which retroactively increased the combined provincial/federal income tax rate by 1% for 2015 and an additional 1% beginning in 2016. As a result, we paid income taxes on our Canadian income at a combined provincial/federal income tax rate of 27% and 26% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have a Canadian loss carryforward of approximately $4.4 million and $4.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the benefit of which we do not expect to realize. We will also be required to pay withholding taxes at a rate of 5% on cash distributed to us from our Canadian subsidiaries in excess of amounts they have borrowed from us.\n10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Special Approval Rights of Energy Capital Partners. If we are unable to acquire any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal from USD, which USD retained the right to develop and operate at the time of our IPO, these expansions may compete directly with our current Hardisty terminal assets for future throughput volumes, which may impact our ability to enter into new terminal services agreements, including with our existing customers, following the termination of our existing agreements or the terms thereof and our ability to compete for future spot volumes. Furthermore, cyclical changes in the demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons may cause USD or us to reevaluate any future expansion projects, including any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal. Additionally, if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our DCF.\nWe intend to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of at least $0.2875 per unit. Our most recently declared quarterly distribution of $0.3300 per unit equates to approximately $7.6 million per quarter, or $30.6 million per year, based on the number of common, Class A, subordinated, and general partner units outstanding as of February 13, 2017. Notwithstanding the recommendation of the management of our general partner, members of our general partner's board of directors appointed by Energy Capital Partners, if any, must approve any distributions made by us.\nSubcontracted rail services. We subcontract a majority of the services related to the operations of our terminals, which costs are primarily fixed. These Subcontracted rail services costs increased $0.7 million to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015, which contributed approximately $0.4 million to these costs and partially due to our Hardisty terminal being operational for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months of operation in 2014 when the terminal was placed into service. Our subcontracted rail services costs would have been approximately $0.8 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\na sufficient population upon which to derive an EBITDA multiple. These factors, among others, could cause our estimates of fair value for the Casper terminal reporting unit to vary significantly from the amounts determined under this method.\nGain associated with derivative instruments. In May 2014 and June 2015, we entered into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, specifically between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, related to operations at our Hardisty terminal. We record all of our derivative financial instruments at fair market value in our consolidated financial statements, which we adjust each period for changes in the fair market value, or mark to market.\n (4) Includes amounts we received as a partial refund of approximately $3.7 million (representing C$4.9 million) for our 2015 foreign income taxes. \n \u2022 the excess cash flow being retained for use in enhancing our existing business; and \nWe provide our customers with railcars and fleet services related to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail on a multi-year, take-or-pay basis under master fleet services agreements for periods ranging from five to nine years. We do not own any railcars. As of December 31, 2016, our railcar fleet consisted of 2,953 railcars, which we leased from various railcar manufacturers and financial entities, including 2,108 C&I railcars. We have assigned certain payment and performance obligations under the leases and master fleet service agreements for 2,613 of the railcars to other parties, but we have retained certain rights and obligations with respect to the servicing of these railcars. Approximately 84% of our current railcar fleet is dedicated to customers of our Hardisty terminal. The remaining 16% of our railcar fleet is dedicated to a customer of terminals belonging to subsidiaries previously sold by our predecessor. The master fleet services agreements we have with certain of our Hardisty terminal customers have a weighted-average remaining contract life of 4.6 years as of December 31, 2016. In the aggregate, our master fleet services agreements have a weighted-average remaining contract life of 4.1 years as of December 31, 2016.\nSupply and Demand for Crude Oil and Refined Products\n (2) Represents costs incurred associated with unrecovered reimbursable freight costs related to the initial delivery of railcars in support of the Hardisty terminal. \nCash Distributions\nWe apply a disciplined approach to pursuing our growth strategy, which may include organic growth initiatives as well as acquisitions of energy-related logistics assets. Potential acquisitions may include assets developed by our sponsor or by third party logistics providers.\nForeign currency transaction loss (gain) Our Terminalling services segment recognized minimal foreign currency transaction gains for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with losses of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are primarily the result of routine settlement of U.S. dollar denominated transactions with Canadian dollars by our Canadian subsidiaries.\nHistorically, we contracted with railroads on behalf of some of our customers to arrange for the movement of railcars from our terminals to the destinations selected by our customers. We were the contracting party with the railroads for those shipments and were responsible to the railroads for the related fees charged by the railroads, for which we were reimbursed by our customers. Both the fees charged by the railroads to us and the reimbursement of these fees by our customers are included in our consolidated statements of operations in the revenues and operating costs line items entitled Freight and other reimbursables.\u201d\nIn August 2016, we received notification from the customer of our San Antonio terminal stating their intent to terminate their terminalling services agreement with us in early February 2017, which was extended in January 2017 to early May 2017. In early February 2017, the lessor of the real property upon which the San Antonio terminal resides indicated their intent to terminate our lease with them concurrently with the conclusion of the extension agreement for terminalling services we have with our customer, at which time we expect to wind down the operations of this terminal. As a result we have recognized a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, including an asset retirement obligation of $1.0 million for amounts we expect to spend to restore the property to its original condition. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our San Antonio terminal contributed less than 3% of our Adjusted EBITDA. Except as indicated above, we do not expect the termination of this agreement to have a material impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for our Terminalling services segment decreased by $1.6 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower weighted average balances of outstanding debt and weighted average interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, a majority of the interest expense we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015, is associated with the outstanding balance on our Term Loan Facility, which is denominated in Canadian dollars. Our interest expense would have been approximately $0.3 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, substantially all of our interest expense was denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, exchange rate fluctuations did not affect the reported interest expense.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.2 million to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Salaries and benefits, property taxes and other administrative costs were higher for the year ended December 31, 2015, than for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015. These costs were more than offset by a $0.9 million decrease in management fees charged to the terminalling businesses in 2014 prior to our IPO that were subsequently discontinued.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $213.2 million to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $213.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in 2015, with no acquisition activity in 2016. In addition, there were fewer growth capital expenditures made to enhance our terminal operations during the year ended December 31, 2016, than we made during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nOur sponsor retained the right to develop certain expansions of our Hardisty terminal, which they are actively pursuing. These expansions may include solutions to transport heavier grades of crude oil produced in Western Canada, which our sponsor believes will maximize benefits to producers, refiners and railroads.\n \u2022 our ability to renew contracts with existing customers, enter into contracts with new customers, increase customer commitments and throughput volumes at our terminals, and provide additional ancillary services at those terminals. \n \u2022 Maintenance capital expenditures are cash expenditures made to maintain, over the long term, our operating capacity, operating income or our asset base. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures to repair and refurbish our terminals. \nterminal. As a result, portions of our cash and cash equivalents are denominated in Canadian dollars and are held by foreign subsidiaries, which amounts are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to evaluate our operations. We consider these metrics to be significant factors in assessing our ability to generate cash and pay distributions and include: (i) Adjusted EBITDA and DCF; (ii) operating and maintenance expenses; and (iii) volumes. We define Adjusted EBITDA and DCF below.\nOther Expenses\nFactors That May Impact Future Results of Operations\nAmounts outstanding on the Term Loan Facility are not subject to any scheduled repayment prior to its maturity on July 14, 2019. Mandatory prepayments of the Term Loan Facility are required from certain non-ordinary course asset sales subject to customary exceptions and reinvestment rights.\nWe do not amortize goodwill, but test it for impairment annually based on the carrying values of our reporting units on the first day of the third quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. The assessment of the recoverability of goodwill is highly subjective due to frequent changes in economic conditions underlying the assumptions upon which the valuations are based and global factors affecting the prices for crude oil and demand for our services. In assessing our ability to recover the carrying value of goodwill, we make critical assumptions that include but are not limited to:\nWe record property and equipment at its original cost, which we depreciate on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to 20 years. Our determination of the useful lives of property and equipment requires us to make various assumptions when the assets are acquired or placed into service about the expected usage, normal wear and tear and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements that extend the service life or capacity of existing property and equipment are capitalized. Upon the sale or retirement of an asset, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in our operating results.\nOperating and Maintenance. Operating and maintenance expenses decreased $0.2 million to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Maintenance and repair costs were higher for the year ended December 31, 2015, than for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to maintenance repairs at our terminals. These costs were more than offset by a decrease in expenses for operational materials and supplies attributable to the decrease in the number of railcar shipments.\nAs indicated above, our estimate of fair value for the Casper terminal reporting unit required us to use significant unobservable inputs representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including assumptions related to the future performance of our Casper terminal. We completed our impairment analysis of goodwill and determined that the fair value of the Casper terminal reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at July 1, 2016, by an amount slightly greater than 9%. We have not observed any events or circumstances subsequent to our analysis that would suggest the fair value of our Casper terminal is below its carrying amount as of December 31, 2016.\nAssessment of Recoverability of Goodwill\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to off-balance sheet arrangements relating to various master fleet services agreements, whereby we have agreed to assign certain payment and other obligations to third party special purpose entities that are not consolidated with us. We have also entered into agreements to provide fleet services to these special purpose entities for fixed servicing fees and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. The purpose of these transactions is to remove the risk to us of non-payment by our customers, which would otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. For more information on these special purpose entities see the discussion of our relationship with the variable interest entities described in Note 12 - Nonconsolidated Variable Interest Entities and Note 13 - Transactions with Related Parties to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. Liabilities related to these arrangements are generally not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material impact on our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition as a result of these off-balance sheet arrangements.\nLiquidity Sources\ncontributing to the greater revenue in 2015 is the addition of the Casper terminal in mid-November, which provided an additional $3.8 million of revenue to our Terminalling services business. Our terminalling services revenue was also affected by the decline in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Our terminalling services revenue would have been approximately $8.3 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe also incur additional general and administrative expenses annually as a result of being a publicly traded partnership, consisting of costs associated with SEC reporting requirements, tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, independent auditor fees, investor relations activities, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, stock exchange listing, registrar and transfer agent fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance and director compensation. These additional general and administrative expenses are not reflected in our historical financial statements.\nThe EBITDA multiples we used to estimate the fair value of the Casper terminal reporting unit are subject to uncertainty associated with market conditions in the energy sector. We derived the assumption based upon EBITDA multiples for several peer organizations that operate in the mid-stream energy sector, generally providing services associated with the transportation of energy-related products. The EBITDA multiples of each of these entities is affected by changes in the supply of and demand for energy-related products, which affects the demand for the services they provide. Declines in the production of energy-related products as well as lower demand for these products can reduce the operating results of these organizations and accordingly, the multiples that market participants are willing to pay for EBITDA, which is used as a proxy for cash flow. Changes in the EBITDA multiples of the peer organizations we use to estimate fair value could significantly affect the fair value of the Casper terminal reporting unit we derived using this approach.\nEthanol Terminal Services Agreements. We have terminal services agreements with subsidiaries of an investment grade company for our San Antonio and West Colton terminals pursuant to which we are paid fixed fees per gallon of ethanol transloaded at each terminal. In August 2016, we received notification from the customer of our San Antonio terminal of their intent to terminate their terminalling services agreement with us, effective February 2017, which date was extended in January 2017 to May 1, 2017. In early February 2017, the lessor of the real property upon which the San Antonio terminal resides indicated their intent to terminate our lease with them concurrently with the conclusion of the extension agreement for terminalling services we have with our customer, at which time we expect to wind down the operations of this terminal. The agreement entitles the customer to 100% of the terminal's capacity, subject to our right to seek additional customers if minimum volume usage thresholds are not met. We expect to wind down the operations of our San Antonio terminal following the May 1, 2017, termination date as discussed in more detail below under General Trends and Outlook - San Antonio Terminal and in Note 7. Property and Equipment to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. The West Colton terminal services agreement has been in place since July 2009 and is terminable at any time by either party upon 150 days' notice. We are seeking permits to construct an approximately one-mile pipeline directly from our West Colton terminal to Kinder Morgan Inc.'s gasoline blending terminals, which, if approved and constructed, may result in long-term volume commitments and cash flows.\nRelated party deferred revenues from the special purpose entities were $2.8 million as of December 31, 2015, which were recorded in \"Deferred revenue-related party\" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\ngranted to certain executive officers and other key employees of USDG. We recognize the expense associated with the outstanding phantom units and with each Class A Vesting Tranche ratably over its requisite service period.\nFor example, Canadian Natural Resources recently announced plans to reinstate the development of the 40,000 Bpd Kirby North project and the evaluation of an opportunity to debottleneck the Horizon fractionation tower during upcoming turnaround work in order to increase production by 5,000 to 15,000 Bpd. Cenovus announced plans to resume construction on its 50,000 Bpd Christina Lake Phase G project and is advancing engineering work on two previously deferred expansion projects that total 75,000 Bpd of expected design capacity. MEG Energy announced an initiative at its Christina Lake Phase 2B project that is expected to increase production by approximately 20,000 Bpd. Consistent with these trends, our partner, Gibson Energy, recently commissioned ahead of schedule 2.9 million barrels of incremental storage capacity at the Hardisty hub, representing a nearly 50% increase. Gibson successfully secured short term contracts to utilize the tanks, as necessary, until the long-term take-or-pay contracts commence later in 2017.\nWe cannot assure you that USD will be able to develop or construct, or that we or USD will be able to acquire, any additional midstream infrastructure projects. Among other things, the ability of USD to further develop the Hardisty terminal, or any other project, and our ability to acquire such projects, will depend upon USD's and our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing. We are under no obligation to make any offer, and USD and USDG are under no obligation to accept any offer we make, with respect to any asset subject to our right of first offer. Additionally, the approval of Energy Capital Partners is required for the sale of any assets by USD or its subsidiaries, including us (other than sales in the ordinary course of business), acquisitions of securities of other entities that exceed specified materiality thresholds and any material unbudgeted expenditures or deviations from our approved budgets. Energy Capital Partners may make these decisions free of any duty to us and our unitholders. This approval would be required for the potential acquisition by us of any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal, as well as any other projects or assets that USD may develop or acquire in the future or any third party acquisition we may pursue independently or jointly with USD. Energy Capital Partners is under no obligation to approve any such transaction. Please refer to the discussion under Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Special Approval Rights of Energy Capital Partners regarding the rights of Energy Capital Partners. If we are unable to acquire any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal from USD, which USD retained the right to develop and operate at the time of our IPO, these expansions may compete directly with our Hardisty terminal for future throughput volumes, which may impact our ability to enter into new terminal services agreements, including with our existing customers, following the termination of our existing agreements, or the terms thereof, and our ability to compete for future spot volumes. Furthermore, cyclical changes in the demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons may cause USD, or us, to further re-evaluate any future expansion projects, including expansion of the Hardisty terminal.\nInterest Rate Environment\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $179.1 million to $213.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015. Investing activities in 2014 were primarily associated with the development of the Hardisty terminal, which was fully operational during 2015.\nPrior to our IPO, we were included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of our sponsor, in which we were treated as an entity disregarded as separate from our sponsor for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subsequent to the closing of our IPO, we have been and continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with each partner being separately taxed on their share of our taxable income. Therefore, no U.S. federal income tax expense is reflected in our financial statements for periods prior to the October 15, 2014, closing of our IPO.\nWe incur unit based compensation expense associated with the phantom units granted to directors, officers and employees of USDG pursuant to the USD Partners LP 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, and Class A units\nSummary Analysis of Operating Results\nPrior to June 2014, our operating income was predominantly derived from our San Antonio and West Colton terminals and, as a result, we historically had minimal exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, we derive a significant amount of operating income from our Canadian operations, particularly our Hardisty terminal. Given our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar, our operating income and assets which are denominated in Canadian dollars will be positively affected when the Canadian dollar increases in relation to the U.S. dollar and will be negatively affected when the Canadian dollar decreases relative to the U.S. dollar, assuming all other factors are held constant. Conversely, our liabilities which are denominated in Canadian dollars will be positively affected when the Canadian dollar decreases in relation to the U.S. dollar and will be negatively affected when the Canadian dollar increases relative to the U.S. dollar. We have entered into derivative contracts to mitigate a significant portion of the potential impact that fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar may have on cash flows generated by our Hardisty terminal operations through 2017. As a result, we do not expect foreign currency exchange rates to have a significant impact on our operating cash flows in the near term. The derivative contracts in place for our 2016 fiscal year secured a minimum exchange rate of 0.84 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar for the majority of our anticipated Canadian cash flows, whereas our derivative contracts for 2015 secured a minimum exchange rate of 0.91 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. For our 2017 fiscal year, we have entered into forward contracts that effectively fix the amount we will receive in U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar at an exchange rate of approximately 0.78.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $102.3 million to $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we borrowed $203 million on our Revolving Credit facility, which was primarily used for the acquisition of the Casper terminal. Partially offsetting the proceeds we received from financing activities were cash distributions of $24.0 million and repayment on our Term Loan Facility of $30.5 million. During 2014, we received net proceeds of $137.5 million from our initial public offering after underwriting discounts, commissions and reimbursements of USDG for expenses of the offering. We also received $67.8 million, net of deferred financing costs, from the Bank of Oklahoma credit facility, which we used to repay a loan previously made to us by our sponsor for the development of the Hardisty terminal. In addition, we received proceeds of $100 million on our Term loan which we distributed to USDG. We also received a $14.3 million contribution from our sponsor in 2014. These proceeds were partially offset by repayment of $97.8 million on our Bank of Oklahoma credit facility, repayment of $49.4 million on loans outstanding from our parent and repayment of $15.0 million on our Term Loan Facility.\nOur Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee debt, incur liens, make investments, make restricted payments, engage in business activities, engage in mergers, consolidations and other organizational changes, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets or enter into burdensome agreements or enter into transactions with affiliates on terms that are not arm's length, in each case, subject to exceptions.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" adjusted for changes in working capital items, changes in restricted cash, interest, income taxes, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, adjustments related to deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees and other items which do not affect the underlying cash flows produced by our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP, supplemental financial measure used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe comparability of our current financial results in relation to prior periods are affected by the factors described below.\nRailroad Incentive Payments\nCertain end users, including refineries across North America, have made substantial investments in recent years in order to efficiently process heavy grades of crude oil, such as those from Western Canada. Even with recent regulatory approvals, additions to pipeline takeaway capacity are not expected to keep pace with production growth over the next several years. As a result, multiple industry forecasts project demand for rail takeaway solutions will increase in 2017 and 2018. Our Hardisty and Casper terminals, with established capacity and scalable designs, are well-positioned as strategic locations to meet expected future takeaway needs.\nCash Flows\n (3) Interest payable on our Credit Agreement is variable. We estimated interest through maturity using rates in effect on December 31, 2016. \n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $199.3 million to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from net cash provided of $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2016 we\nSubstantially all of our operating cash flows are generated from take-or-pay contracts and, as a result, are not directly related to actual throughput volumes at our terminals. The volume of crude oil loaded at our Hardisty and Casper terminals is primarily influenced by the difference in price between Western Canadian Select, or WCS, and other grades of crude oil processed by refiners, commonly referred to as spreads, rather than absolute price levels. Spreads are influenced by, among other things, the availability of crude oil supplies relative to the level of demand from end users, such as refiners.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nWe estimate our 2017 income tax provision to approximate C$5.7 million, based upon the current operations of our foreign subsidiaries. These estimates are subject to changes in the underlying operating activities and results of these foreign subsidiaries, as well as fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, among other factors.\nPipeline fees. We incur pipeline fees related to a facilities connection agreement with Gibson for the delivery of crude oil from Gibson's Hardisty storage terminal to our Hardisty terminal via pipeline. The pipeline fees we pay to Gibson are based on a predetermined formula, which includes amounts collected from customers at our Hardisty terminal. We may defer recognizing portions of these costs as expense until such time as we recognize the related deferred revenue following the expiration of any make-up rights provisions. Pipeline fees increased $3.6 million to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the increase in direct operating income we recognized at our Hardisty terminal.\nThe operating costs of our Terminalling services segment increased $22.5 million to $59.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our acquisition of the Casper terminal which added $18.6 million of incremental operating costs during 2016. Our operating expenses would have been approximately $1.2 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBased on the nature of our operations, our assets typically require minimal to no maintenance capital expenditures. However, we expect to incur costs to maintain our assets in compliance with sound business practice, our contractual relationships and applicable regulatory requirements, some of which will be characterized as maintenance capital expenditures. Both our Hardisty and Casper terminals were constructed in 2014, and therefore, we do not expect to incur significant maintenance capital expenditures in the near term to maintain the operating capacity of these facilities.\nFrom May 20, 2014, when we initially executed our derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to Canadian cash flows, to December 31, 2014, the exchange rate, representing the midpoint of the range between the bid and ask prices, between the U.S. and Canadian dollars decreased from 0.9186 to 0.8621 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. This change in the exchange rate increased the value of our derivative contracts at December 31, 2014, relative to the value at May 20, 2014, producing a gain of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTerminalling services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, excludes approximately $24.2 million of amounts associated with minimum monthly commitment fees we received as payment from our customers that we have deferred and recorded as short-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have deferred recognizing this revenue in connection with the minimum monthly commitment fees paid by customers of our Hardisty terminal that are in excess of their actual throughput volumes due to the make-up rights we have granted them under their terminal services agreements with us. Our customers can use these make-up rights for periods of up to six months to offset throughput volumes in excess of their minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We recognized the deferred amounts in revenue as our customers use these rights, upon expiration of the make-up period, or when our customers' ability to utilize those rights is determined to be remote. We recognized approximately $14.6 million of previously deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nand debt securities. The debt securities may be guaranteed by some or all of our subsidiaries. The registration statement became effective May 18, 2016 and is available for use for up to three years. We may conduct offerings under this registration statement at any time. We may use the net proceeds from any such offerings for general partnership purposes, which may include funding debt repayment, future acquisitions, capital expenditures and additions to working capital.\nOperating costs primarily consist of railcar leases and related expenses incurred for services provided to customers of our terminals. Operating costs of our fleet services segment decreased $5.6 million to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the number of directly leased railcars in our fleet and a reduction in activity, which also resulted in a decrease of $5.7 million in Fleet leases costs and essentially no change in Freight and other reimbursables costs. \"Selling, general and administrative\" and \"Operating and maintenance\" expenses were relatively consistent between periods.\nProvision for income taxes. We recognized income tax expense of $242 thousand with respect to our Fleet services business for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with $173 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, which amounts are primarily attributable to additional taxable income.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and issuances of letters of credit are available for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and general partnership purposes, including distributions. As we make payments on the Term Loan Facility, availability equal to the U.S. dollar equivalent amount of the payments is automatically transferred from the Term Loan Facility to the Revolving Credit Facility, ultimately increasing availability on the Revolving Credit Facility to $400 million once the Term Loan Facility is fully repaid. In addition, we have the ability to increase the maximum amount of credit available under the Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount of up to $100 million, to a total facility size of $500 million, as amended, subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders or other financial institutions and satisfaction of certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an aggregate $20 million sublimit for standby letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by our restricted subsidiaries, and are secured by a first priority lien on our assets and those of our restricted subsidiaries, other than certain excluded assets.\nFleet Services Segment\n (4) Principal repayment obligations under our Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2016. \nThe key assumptions listed above were based upon economic conditions existing at or prior to the July 1, 2016, valuation date. Our weighted average cost of capital is subject to variability and is dependent upon such factors as changes in benchmark rates of interest established by the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board, the British Bankers Association and other central banking regulatory authorities, as well as perceptions of risk and market uncertainty regarding our business, industry and those of our peers and our underlying capital structure. We expect our long-term underlying capital structure to approximate a weighting of 50% debt and 50% equity. Each of the above assumptions are likely to change due to economic uncertainty surrounding global and North American energy markets that are highly correlated with crude oil, natural gas and other energy-related commodity prices and other market factors.\nSan Antonio Terminal\nThe following table sets forth the operating results of our Terminalling services business and the approximate average daily throughput volumes of our terminals for the specified periods:\nThe amount of Terminalling services revenue we generate depends on minimum customer commitment fees and the volume of crude oil that we handle at our terminals in excess of those minimum commitments, as well as the volume of biofuels transloaded at our ethanol terminals. These volumes are primarily affected by the supply of and demand for crude oil, refined products and biofuels in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Additionally, these volumes are affected by the spreads between the benchmark prices for these products, which are influenced by, among other things, the available takeaway capacity in those markets. Although customers at our Hardisty and Casper terminals have committed to minimum monthly fees under their terminal services agreements with us, which will generate the majority of our Terminalling services revenue, our results of operations will also be affected by:\n \u2022 the favorable impact of gains on the foreign currency derivative instrument contracts we entered into in May 2014 and June 2015, which were largely offset by the continued deterioration of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, that reduced the operating results of our Canadian subsidiaries when translated into U.S. dollars. \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.5 million to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015, which contributed approximately $1.8 million to depreciation and amortization expense and partially due to depreciation of our Hardisty terminal for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months for 2014, the year in which the terminal was placed into service. Our depreciation and amortization expense would have been approximately $0.6 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nMarket Update\nFrom December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, the exchange rate, representing the midpoint of the range for the bid and ask prices between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, increased from 0.7210 to 0.7440 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. This change in the exchange rate decreased the value of our derivative contracts at December 31, 2016, relative to the value at December 31, 2015, producing a loss of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. By way of comparison, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the exchange rate, between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar decreased from 0.8621 to 0.7210 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar, producing a gain of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCasper Terminal Services Agreements. Our Casper terminal is supported by take-or-pay terminal services agreements with high quality, primarily investment grade refiners. The initial term of the agreements varies from three to five years, with extension or renewal options for one to three additional years, and a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 1.96 years as of December 31, 2016. Under these terminal services agreements, our customers are obligated to pay the greater of a minimum monthly commitment fee or a throughput fee based on the actual volume of crude oil loaded. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its maximum allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit which may be used to offset future throughput fees in excess of the minimum monthly commitment fees, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. Unused credits generally expire if not used by the end of each calendar quarter.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nTerminalling Services\n \u2022 after we have issued at least $150.0 million of unsecured notes, a Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 (or 4.00 to 1.00 during a Material Acquisition Period). \nservices agreements with us. Our customers can use these make-up rights for periods of up to six months to offset throughput volumes in excess of their minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We expect to recognize the deferred amounts in revenue as our customers use these rights, upon expiration of the make-up period, or when our customers' ability to utilize those rights is determined to be remote. We recognized approximately $24.2 million of previously deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFreight and other reimbursables. Freight and other reimbursables revenues decreased $0.6 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulting from a decrease in the delivery and shipment of railcars associated with the startup of our Hardisty terminal that occurred in 2014, partially offset by additional repairs and maintenance costs we incurred and passed through to our customers. Freight and other reimbursables revenues were exactly offset by Freight and other reimbursables costs payable to the railroads.\nCapital Requirements\nConsistent with recent industry trends, we have proactively managed our operating costs in an effort to align with the current business environment. These efforts are likely to continue to result in cost savings over the near term. However, we do not expect these benefits to remain over the long term as market conditions improve.\nHistorically, we have received incentive payments from railroads in connection with large capital projects that are projected to create incremental traffic on their networks. With respect to our Hardisty terminal, we have the right to receive incentive payments based on the number of railcars loaded for certain customers through mid-2017. A portion of these payments increase the pipeline fees payable to Gibson. The decline in these payments is due to a decrease in the number of railcars loaded in 2016 as compared with 2015.\nHigh-growth crude oil production areas in North America are often located at significant distances from refining centers, creating constantly evolving regional imbalances, which require the expedited development of flexible and sustainable transportation solutions. The extensive existing rail network, combined with rail transportation's relatively low capital and fixed costs compared to other transportation alternatives, has strategically positioned rail as a long-term transportation solution to growing and evolving energy infrastructure needs. In the event that additional pipeline capacity is constructed, or crude oil production decreases significantly, demand for transportation of crude oil by rail may be impacted.\nOther Expenses\nCustomer Contract Expirations and Renewals\n (3) an expected range of EBITDA multiples derived from equity prices of public companies with similar operating and investment characteristics; and \n (1) Pursuant to the terms of our Credit Agreement, our borrowing capacity for 2016 is limited to 4.5 times our trailing 12-month Consolidated EBITDA. \nIn October 2015, our sponsor announced a joint venture to develop a premier U.S. Gulf Coast logistics terminal on a 988-acre parcel of property on the Houston Ship Channel. Its strategic location is uniquely positioned to provide customers with flexible market access to key demand centers, both domestic and abroad. Preliminary master planning efforts suggest that the property footprint is capable of supporting up to ten to twelve million barrels of storage capacity, multiple docks (including barge and deep water), and a rail terminal with capacity to unload multiple unit trains per day. The property is in proximity to substantially all major inbound and outbound pipelines and can be directly accessed by multiple Class 1 railroads.\nThe interest rates available in U.S. and international credit markets remain near historic lows, although the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has stated their intent to further increase interest rates in the U.S. over the next twelve months. As the overall economy strengthens, we expect monetary policy will tighten to counter possible inflation, resulting in higher interest rates. Should interest rates continue to rise, our financing costs will increase accordingly. This could affect our future ability to access the credit markets at rates we consider reasonable to fund our future growth. Additionally, as with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price will be affected by the level of our cash distributions and an associated implied distribution yield. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units, and, as such, a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity, or increase the cost of issuing equity. However, we expect that our cost of capital would remain competitive, as our competitors would face similar circumstances.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value. We reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its fair value at the time we determine that an impairment has occurred.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - BY SEGMENT\nIncome Taxes\nUnder the master fleet services agreements, we provide customers with railcar-specific fleet services, which may include, among other things, the provision of relevant administrative and billing services, the maintenance of railcars in accordance with standard industry practice and applicable laws, the management and tracking of the movement of railcars, the regulatory and administrative reporting and compliance as required in connection with the movement of railcars, and the negotiation for and sourcing of railcars. Our customers typically pay us and our assignees monthly fees per railcar for these services, which include a component for railcar use and a component for fleet services.\nOther Items Affecting Liquidity\nU.S. Gulf Coast\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nTerminalling services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, excludes approximately $27.1 million of amounts associated with minimum monthly commitment fees we received as payment from our customers that we have deferred and recorded as short-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have deferred recognizing this revenue in connection with the minimum monthly commitment fees paid by customers of our Hardisty terminal that are in excess of their actual throughput volumes due to the make-up rights we have granted them under their terminal\nFleet services. We receive a service fee for fleet management services we provide for both the railcars we directly lease to our customers and those railcar leases that have been assigned to related parties of USD. The average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services increased to approximately 3,500 for the year ended December 31, 2015, from approximately 2,800 for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a result of the increase in the average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services, our fleet services revenue increased by $1.2 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses for our Fleet services segment decreased $1.7 million to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a provision for bad debts for unrecoverable reimbursable freight costs we incurred in 2014 for the initial delivery of railcars on behalf of a customer that we did not incur in 2015.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results\nAcquisition Opportunities\nCredit Risk\nAdditionally, we are required to maintain the following financial ratios, each determined on a quarterly basis for the immediately preceding four quarter period then ended (or such shorter period as shall apply, on an annualized basis):\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes. A significant amount of our operating income is generated by our Hardisty terminal, located in the Canadian province of Alberta. As a Canadian business, operating income from our Hardisty terminal is subject to corporate income tax rates enacted by the Canadian federal and the Alberta provincial governments, which on a combined basis have increased from 26% in 2015 to 27% beginning January 1, 2016. As a result, we recognized income tax liabilities and expenses in our consolidated financial statements based upon these higher income tax rates.\nthe year ended December 31, 2015, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase for 2016 is primarily the result of cash generated by our Casper terminal, which we acquired in November 2015. The increase in 2015 is primarily due to a full year of operating our Hardisty terminal whereas in 2014 the Hardisty terminal was only operational for half of the year.\nThe following table sets forth our corporate charges for each of the periods indicated:\nAdjusted EBITDA from our Terminalling services segment increased $22.2 million to $67.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased $30.0 million for\nOperating Costs\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this discussion to USD Partners, USDP, the Partnership, we, our, us or like terms used in the present tense or prospectively (periods beginning on or after October 15, 2014) refer to USD Partners LP and its subsidiaries. References to the Predecessor, we, our, us, or like terms, when used in a historical context (periods prior to October 15, 2014), refer to the following subsidiaries, collectively, that were contributed to USD Partners in connection with our initial public offering of 9,120,000 common units completed on October 15, 2014: San Antonio Rail Terminal LLC, USD Logistics Operations GP LLC, USD Logistics Operations LP, USD Rail LP, USD Rail Canada ULC, USD Rail International S.A.R.L., USD Terminals Canada ULC, USD Terminals International S.A.R.L. and West Colton Rail Terminal LLC, collectively, the Contributed Subsidiaries.\" The Predecessor also includes the membership interests in the following five subsidiaries of US Development Group LLC, or USD, which operated crude oil rail terminals that were sold in December 2012: Bakersfield Crude Terminal LLC, Eagle Ford Crude Terminal LLC, Niobrara Crude Terminal LLC, St. James Rail Terminal LLC, and Van Hook Crude Terminal LLC, collectively known as the Discontinued Operations.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this report.\nOur sponsor retained the right to develop certain expansions of our Hardisty terminal, which they are actively pursuing. These expansions may include solutions to transport heavier grades of crude oil produced in Western Canada, which our sponsor believes will maximize benefits to producers, refiners and railroads. Our sponsor is also currently in discussions with potential customers related to its proposed development of a marine terminal joint venture on the Houston Ship Channel. We anticipate that any solutions developed by our sponsor would be subject to the right of first offer in our favor contained in the omnibus agreement between us and USD.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\n \u2022 additional terminalling services revenue resulting from inflation-indexed rate escalations associated with our terminalling services agreements; \nOperating and Maintenance Expenses\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to make distributions to our unitholders, finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions and the costs we may incur to construct new assets, and service our debt. Historically, we have financed our operations with cash generated from our operating activities, borrowings under our credit facility and loans from our sponsor.\n \u2022 the amount of cash available for making distributions to our unitholders; \n \u2022 increased corporate costs largely associated with unit based compensation due to increases in the trading price of our common units and additional amounts we are charged pursuant to the omnibus agreement; \n\nProvision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes for our Fleet services segment was $173 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, and $140 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014, in each case primarily consisting of provisions for state franchise taxes and federal income taxes of USD Rail LP.\nFleet services. We receive a service fee for fleet management services we provide for both the railcars we directly lease to our customers and those railcar leases that, subsequent to June 30, 2016, have been assigned to unrelated parties. The average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services decreased to approximately 3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, from approximately 3,500 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The declines are the result of non-renewal of expiring railcar leases associated with activities of our Predecessor. As a result of the decrease in the average number of railcars for which we provide fleet management services, our fleet services revenue declined by $0.5 million from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016.\nHistorically, our operations were financed with cash generated by our operations and intercompany loans from our sponsor. On October 15, 2014, in connection with the closing of our IPO, we entered into a five-year, $300.0 million senior secured credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, comprised of a $100.0 million term loan, the Term Loan Facility (borrowed in Canadian dollars and maturing on July 14, 2019) and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, the Revolving Credit Facility (maturing on October 15, 2019), which is automatically increased as the Term Loan Facility principal is reduced.\nOne of the customers at our Casper terminal, whose terminalling services agreement with us represented approximately $12 million of our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, has a remaining term expiring in the third quarter of 2017, if not otherwise renewed or extended. This customer did not exercise its option to extend the agreement for an additional three-year term. We remain in active discussions with this customer, as well as other existing and potential new customers, for the provision of terminalling services by our Casper Terminal. We also are in active discussions with respect to the provision of terminalling services at our Hardisty terminal for periods following the terms of our existing agreements. Projected growth in Western Canada crude oil production, including recently announced additions to oil sands production capacity, represents a meaningful opportunity to meet upcoming takeaway needs with our strategically-positioned and scalable assets, particularly given current industry headwinds for new infrastructure projects. For a discussion of the risks associated with our ability to renew, extend or replace customer contracts, see Risk Factors - Our contracts subject us to renewal risks.\nWe completed a study we commissioned in 2015 to evaluate the appropriate return attributable to the activities of our foreign subsidiaries, based upon the performance of risk management and other functions we provide. Based upon the results of this study, we adopted a methodology for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries and concluded the return initially attributed to the activities of our foreign subsidiaries exceeded the amounts considered to be reasonable based on the functions we provide on behalf of these subsidiaries. As a result, we determined that we had over-estimated our foreign income tax liability for 2015 by approximately $4.4 million, a majority of which was refunded to us prior to December 31, 2016. We received an additional refund of approximately $0.6 million (representing C$0.9 million) in February 2017 and do not expect any additional income tax refunds with respect to our 2015 Canadian income taxes.\nOperating Costs\nWe anticipate reducing our outstanding indebtedness to the extent we generate cash flows in excess of our operating and investing needs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repaid C$44.0 million on our Term Loan Facility (the equivalent of $33.6 million) and $8.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. These payments were partially offset by proceeds from borrowing $20.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility, which we used for general partnership purposes.\nCash Requirements\nTerminalling Services Segment\nWe recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the relevant basis of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. We record the impact of changes in tax legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period the legislation is enacted.\nOperating Costs\nIn addition to the above, certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities. The basis for our estimates is historical experience, consultation with experts and other sources we believe to be reliable. While we believe our estimates are appropriate, actual results can and often do differ from these estimates. Any effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nTERMINALLING SERVICES\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into a variety of contractual obligations and other commitments. The following table summarizes the principal amount of our future minimum obligations and commitments that have remaining non-cancellable terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2016:\nOur partnership agreement requires that we categorize our capital expenditures as either expansion capital expenditures, maintenance capital expenditures or investment capital expenditures.\nThe following table presents our available liquidity as of the dates indicated:\nWe conduct our business through two distinct reporting segments: Terminalling services and Fleet services. We have established these reporting segments as strategic business units to facilitate the achievement of our long-term objectives, to assist in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance.\nDuring construction we capitalize direct costs, such as labor, materials and overhead, as well as interest cost we may incur on indebtedness at our incremental borrowing rate.\n \u2022 an increased number of railcars in service in our Fleet services business resulting from the full year operation of the Hardisty terminal. Operating income of our Fleet services business increased approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period of 2014; \nOur historical capital expenditures have primarily consisted of the costs to construct and acquire energy-related logistics assets. Our operations are expected to require investments to expand, upgrade or enhance existing facilities and to meet environmental and operational regulations.\nWe use the cash generated by our reporting segments to support our liquidity position. Our segments offer different services and are managed accordingly. Our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, regularly reviews financial information about both segments in order to allocate resources and evaluate performance. Our CODM assesses segment performance based on the cash flows produced by our established reporting segments using Segment Adjusted EBITDA. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" adjusted for changes in working capital items, changes in restricted cash, interest, income taxes, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, adjustments related to deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees and other items which do not affect the underlying cash flows produced by our businesses.\nOperating Costs\nFleet Services\n \u2022 Expansion capital expenditures are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term. Examples of expansion capital expenditures include the acquisition of terminals, rail lines and railcars or other complementary midstream assets from USD or third parties and the construction or development of new terminals or additional capacity at our existing terminals to the extent such capital expenditures are expected to expand our operating capacity or operating income. Expansion capital expenditures include interest payments (and related fees) on debt incurred to finance all or a portion of expansion capital expenditures in respect of the period from the date that we enter into a binding obligation to commence the construction, development, replacement, improvement or expansion of a capital asset and ending on the earlier to occur of the date that such capital improvement commences commercial service and the date that such capital improvement is disposed of or abandoned. \nA comprehensive discussion of our operating results by segment is presented below.\nIn mid-2016, wildfires in Alberta significantly interrupted production from nearby oil sands facilities. This meaningfully reduced crude oil supplies available to the market and effectively offset expected production growth for the year. As a result, WCS spreads remained narrow throughout 2016 as existing pipeline capacity largely met takeaway needs.\n \u2022 our ability to identify and execute accretive acquisitions and commercialize organic expansion projects to capture incremental volumes; and \nThe Term Loan Facility was used to fund a $100 million distribution to USDG in connection with the closing of our IPO and is guaranteed by USDG. The guaranty by USDG includes a covenant that USDG maintain a net worth (without taking into account its interests in us, either directly or indirectly) greater than the outstanding amount of the term loan. In the event the USDG net worth covenant is breached and not cured within a certain amount of time, the interest rate on the term loan increases by an additional 1.0%.\nterminal is contracted under multi-year, take-or-pay terminal services agreements subject to inflation-based escalators with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 2.53 years as of December 31, 2016. Furthermore, approximately 83% of the contracted capacity at our Hardisty terminal is contracted with subsidiaries of five investment grade companies. All of our counterparties are obligated to pay a minimum monthly commitment fee and can load a maximum allotted number of unit trains or barrels per month. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its maximum allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit for up to six months. This credit may be used to offset fees on throughput volumes in excess of the customer's minimum monthly commitments in future periods to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We will receive a per-barrel fee on any volumes handled in excess of the customers' maximum allowed volume, to the extent the additional volume is not subject to the credit discussed above. If a force majeure event occurs, a customer's obligation to pay us may be suspended, in which case the length of the contract term will be extended by the same duration as the force majeure event.\nbased on a predetermined formula which includes amounts collected from customers at our Hardisty terminal. We may defer recognizing portions of these costs as expense until such time that we recognize the related deferred revenue following the expiration of any make up rights provisions. Pipeline fees increased $13.6 million to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our Hardisty terminal being operational for a full year during 2015, as compared with approximately six months of operation in 2014 when the terminal was placed into service. Our pipeline fees would have been approximately $2.7 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe believe our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in the following paragraphs address the more significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Each of these areas involve complex situations and a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates related to the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities with the Audit Committee of the board of directors of our general partner.\nOur results of operations for periods prior to our IPO included a $1.2 million management fee each year for the West Colton and San Antonio terminals. In addition, our historical selling, general and administrative costs included certain expenses allocated by our sponsor for corporate costs including insurance, professional fees, facilities, information services, human resources and other support departments, as well as direct expenses. These allocated expenses were charged or allocated to us primarily on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated evenly across the number of operating subsidiaries or allocated based on budgeted volumes or projected revenues. Our sponsor charges us a fixed annual fee for the management and operation of our assets for the provision of various centralized administrative services, as well as allocates general and administrative costs and expenses incurred by them on our behalf. In 2016, the fixed annual fee increased by approximately $0.7 million to $3.2 million, primarily as a result of hiring new employees dedicated to our services. We recently received approval from the Board of Directors to increase the fixed annual fee to $3.3 million for 2017.\nOur selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as new accounting pronouncements have been issued. Accounting decisions generally involve an interpretation of existing accounting principles and the use of judgment in applying those principles to the specific circumstances existing in our business. We make every effort to comply with all applicable accounting principles and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of these principles is critical. However, not all situations we encounter are specifically addressed in the accounting literature. In such cases, we must use our best judgment to implement accounting policies that clearly and accurately present the substance of these situations. We accomplish this by analyzing similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them and consulting with experts about the appropriate interpretation and application of the accounting literature to these situations.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $39.3 million to $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $3.1 million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the increase in net income and the net changes in working capital associated with the operations of our Hardisty terminal, which commenced operations in late June 2014 and was fully operational during the full year ended December 31, 2015. Also contributing to our operating cash flows was our acquisition of the Casper terminal, which contributed to our cash flows from the November 17, 2015 date we acquired the business.\nIn connection with our IPO, we entered into an omnibus agreement with USD and USDG, pursuant to which we were granted a right of first offer on any midstream infrastructure assets that they may develop, construct, or acquire for a period of seven years after the October 15, 2014, closing of our IPO. Additional information about the omnibus agreement and the right of first offer are included in Note 13. Transactions with Related Parties of our consolidated financial statements at Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 our liquidity and the ability of our business to produce sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders; and \nOther Expenses\nCasper Terminal Acquisition\n (1) our projections of future financial performance, which include contract renewal expectations; \nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment, including laws and regulations that govern the handling of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels. Additionally, we are subject to regulations governing railcar design and evolving regulations pertaining to the shipment of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail. Please read Item 1. Business-Impact of Regulation. Similar to other industry participants, compliance with existing and any additional environmental laws and regulations could increase our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities, or the costs of our customers, which may reduce the attractiveness of rail transportation. Our master fleet services agreements generally obligate our customers to pay for modifications and other required repairs to our leased and managed railcar fleet. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully pass all such regulatory costs on to our customers. While changes in these laws and regulations could indirectly affect Adjusted EBITDA and DCF, we believe that consumers of our services place additional value on utilizing established and reputable third-party providers to satisfy their rail terminalling and logistics needs, which may allow us to increase market share relative to customer-owned operations or smaller operators that lack an established track record of safety and regulatory compliance.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at a per annum rate by reference, at the borrowers' election, to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate or CDOR, a base rate, or Canadian prime rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin. Our borrowings under the Credit Agreement for revolving loans bear interest at either a base rate and Canadian prime rate, as applicable plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.25%, or at LIBOR or CDOR, as applicable, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.25% to 3.25%. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at either the base rate and Canadian prime rate, as applicable, plus a margin ranging from 1.35% to 2.35% or at LIBOR or CDOR, as applicable, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.35% to 3.35%. The applicable margin, as well as a commitment fee on the Revolving Credit Facility, ranging from 0.375% per annum to 0.50% per annum on unused commitments, will vary based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in our Credit Agreement. The actual average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness was 3.66% and 2.71% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe Net loss associated with our corporate activities increased by $8.7 million to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.2 million, primarily due to incremental unit based compensation expense associated with the additional Phantom Units granted in February 2016 to directors and employees of our general partner and its affiliates under our Long-Term Incentive Plan. Unit based compensation expense also increased due to a higher closing price for our common units on the NYSE at December 31, 2016, compared with the closing price at December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expense also increased due to the annual adjustment of the management fee we are charged by affiliates of USDG pursuant to the omnibus agreement. Interest expense was the greatest contributor to the increases in corporate activity costs, which increased by $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a higher average balance outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility resulting from amounts we borrowed for our acquisition of the Casper terminal, as well as higher average rates of interest relative to the same period in 2015. We recognized a provision for income taxes of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting primarily of a provision for Texas state franchise tax of USD Partners LP.\nIn 2016, prior to filing our 2015 Canadian tax returns, we adopted a methodology for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries based upon completion of a study we initially commissioned in 2015. The methodology we adopted for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries supported by this study resulted in a reduction of our Canadian income tax liability for the 2015 tax year, as reflected in the Canadian income\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\ntax returns we filed in 2016. The resulting decrease in our Canadian income tax liability was reflected in our 2016 income statement as a reduction to our 2016 provision for income taxes. We have also reduced our provision for income taxes in 2016 for the lower expected Canadian income tax liability we anticipate for 2016 as a result of the methodology we adopted for determining the return attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries.\nGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is only included in our Terminalling services segment.\n (3) Represents foreign exchange transaction gains or losses associated with activities between our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. \n (3) A range of EBITDA multiples derived from stock prices of public companies with similar operating and investment characteristics, from 9x to 10x; and \nThe following discussion relates to the critical accounting policies and estimates for both USD Partners LP and our Predecessor. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. The following accounting policies are considered critical because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events, some over which we may have little or no control. Significant estimates by management include the estimated lives of depreciable property and equipment, recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, and provision and deferral of income taxes.\nOur sponsor is currently pursuing several development projects related to the storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels. These development projects are expected to be supported by long-term take-or-pay\nRefer to Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for a discussion regarding recent accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted.\nOur exposure to credit risk may be affected by the concentration of customers, as well as changes in economic or other conditions. Our customers' businesses react differently to changing conditions. We believe that our credit-review procedures, loss reserves, customer deposits and collection procedures have adequately provided for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future.\nShelf Registration Statement\nWe are not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes or for a majority of the states that impose an income tax. Taxes on our net income are generally borne by our unitholders through the allocation of taxable income, except for USD Rail LP, which, on October 7, 2014, elected to be classified as an entity taxable as a corporation. Our income tax expense is predominantly attributable to Canadian federal and provincial income taxes imposed on our operations based in Canada. Additionally, we are subject to state income tax laws that apply to entities organized as partnerships by the State of Texas. This state income tax is computed on our modified gross margin, which we have determined to be an income tax as set forth in the authoritative accounting guidance. Our current and historical provision for income taxes also reflects income taxes associated with USD Rail LP.\nPipeline fees. We incur pipeline fees related to a facilities connection agreement with Gibson for the delivery of crude oil from Gibson's storage terminal to our Hardisty terminal via pipeline. The pipeline fees paid to Gibson are\n \u2022 Consolidated Leverage Ratio of not greater than 4.50 to 1.00 (or 5.00 to 1.00 at any time after we have issued at least $150.0 million of unsecured notes). In addition, upon the consummation of a Material Acquisition (as defined in our Credit Agreement), for the fiscal quarter in which the Material Acquisition is consummated and for two fiscal quarters immediately following such fiscal quarter (the Material Acquisition Period\u201d), if elected by us by written notice to the Administrative Agent given on or prior to the date of such acquisition, the maximum permitted ratio shall be increased by 0.50 to 1.00 above the otherwise relevant level; and \nVolumes\nProvision for income taxes. A significant amount of our operating income is generated by our Hardisty terminal, which is located in the Canadian province of Alberta. As a Canadian business, operating income from our Hardisty terminal is subject to corporate income tax rates enacted by the Canadian federal and provincial governments, which on a combined basis have increased effective July 1, 2015, from 25% to 26% of taxable income for the entirety of 2015, and which increased further to 27% beginning January 1, 2016. Our provision for income taxes for the Terminalling services segment was $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with $47 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014, partially as a result of these recently enacted tax rate changes. The increase is primarily attributable to the current and deferred income taxes associated with our Hardisty terminal operations, which commenced operations in late June 2014 and did not generate taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue generated by our Terminalling services segment increased $42.0 million to $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to our Hardisty terminal being operational for the entire twelve months in the year ended December 31, 2015, whereas during the year ended December 31, 2014, the terminal operations commenced in late June 2014. Also\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $17.0 million to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the additional depreciation and amortization expense associated with our Casper terminal which we acquired in November 2015. In addition, we incurred a non-cash impairment loss of $3.5 million, in connection with the expected May 1,\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nWe generate substantially all of our operating cash flow from multi-year, take-or-pay contracts for crude oil terminalling services, such as railcar loading for transportation to end markets, storage and blending in on-site tanks, as well as related logistics services. We do not take ownership of the products that we handle nor do we receive any payments from our customers based on the value of such products. We believe rail will continue as an important transportation option for energy producers, refiners and marketers due to its unique advantages relative to other transportation means. Specifically, rail transportation of energy-related products provides flexible access to key demand centers on a relatively low fixed-cost basis with faster physical delivery, while preserving the specific quality of customer products over long distances.\nparty administrative services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue for reimbursable costs is recognized as the costs are incurred. We have deferred revenues for amounts collected from customers in our Fleet services segment, which will be recognized as revenue when earned pursuant to the contractual terms. We have prepaid rent associated with these deferred revenues on our railcar leases, which will be recognized as expense when incurred.\n \u2022 our customers' utilization of our terminals in excess of their minimum monthly volume commitments; \n (3) Represents deferred revenue associated with minimum monthly commitment fees in excess of throughput utilized, which fees are not refundable to our customers. Amounts presented are net of: (a) the corresponding prepaid Gibson pipeline fee that will be recognized as expense concurrently with the recognition of revenue; (b) revenue recognized in the current period that was previously deferred; and (c) expense recognized for previously prepaid Gibson pipeline fees, which correspond with the revenue recognized that was previously deferred. Refer to the discussion in Note 10. Deferred Revenue of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. \nOur historical results of operations include revenues and expenses related to (i) the construction of our Hardisty terminal, (ii) the operation of our San Antonio and West Colton terminals, (iii) our railcar fleet services throughout North America and (iv) the operations of our Hardisty terminal, which commenced in late June 2014. Costs incurred in the Predecessor periods with respect to the Hardisty terminal are primarily related to pre-operational activities.\nThe EBITDA multiples from executed purchase and sales transactions of businesses that are similar to our Casper terminal reporting unit we used to estimate the fair value are also subject to variability, which is dependent upon market conditions in the energy sector, as well as the perceived benefits the acquiring entity expects to derive from the transaction. The transactions comprising the pool occurred during the immediately preceding two years and future transactions may have no correlation to the EBITDA multiples for similar transactions in the future. Further deterioration in economic conditions in the energy sector could result in a greater number of distressed sales at lower EBITDA multiples than currently estimated. Additionally, a representative sample of transactions in the future may not provide\nRevenues\nChanges in environmental and gasoline blending regulations may affect the use of ethanol in the market for transportation fuel. Due to corrosion concerns unique to biofuels, such as ethanol, the long-haul transportation of biofuels via multi-product pipelines is less efficient and less economical than rail. Rail also helps aggregate fragmented ethanol production across the country. In the event that dedicated pipelines are constructed, or additional technologies are developed to allow for more economical transportation of biofuels on multi-product pipelines, demand for transportation of biofuels by rail may be impacted.\nThe volume of crude oil and biofuels that we handle at our terminals and the number of railcars we provide and perform railcar-specific fleet services for ultimately depends on refining and blending margins. Refining and blending margins are dependent mostly upon the price of crude oil or other refinery feedstocks and the price of refined products. These prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including the global supply and demand for crude oil and gasoline and other refined products. The supply of crude oil will depend on numerous factors, including commodity pricing, improvements in extractive technology, environmental regulation and other factors. We believe that our Adjusted EBITDA and DCF will not be impacted in the near term to the extent of our multi-year, take-or-pay terminal services agreements. However, our ability to grow through expansion or acquisitions and our ability to renew or extend our terminal services agreements could be impacted by a long-term reduction in supply or demand.\nCredit Agreement\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nWe intend to make minimum quarterly distributions of at least $0.2875 per common unit ($1.15 per unit on an annualized basis) to the extent we have sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to our general partner. We intend to pay distributions no later than 60 days after the end of each quarter. We paid our most recent distribution on February 17, 2017, at a rate of $0.33 per common unit ($1.32 per unit on an annualized basis) for the quarter ending December 31, 2016, to unitholders of record on February 13, 2017.\n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. \nWestern Canadian crude oil production is projected to increase throughout the next decade, driven primarily by developments in Alberta's oil sands region. In June 2016, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers projected that the supply of crude oil from Western Canada will grow by approximately 590,000 Bpd by 2020 and 890,000 Bpd by 2025 relative to 2015. Since then, several companies have announced plans to increase production capacity at their oil sands facilities, in part due to cost savings and optimization achieved during the recent commodity price downturn.\nFrom December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the exchange rate, representing the midpoint of the range between the bid and ask prices, between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar decreased from 0.8621 to 0.7210 U.S. dollars for each Canadian dollar. This change in the exchange rate increased the value of our derivative contracts at\n (2) Represents costs incurred with respect to unrecovered reimbursable freight costs associated with the initial delivery of railcars in support of our Hardisty terminal. \nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nto payments from customers under master fleet services agreements associated with specific railcars, together with our obligations to make rental payments to the owners of the railcars, to related parties of USD. The assignment of these rights to receive payments under the master fleet services agreements and our obligations to make payments under the associated leases reduced the amount of lease revenue we otherwise would have recognized, and similarly reduced the lease costs as discussed below under operating costs.\nOur sponsor expects that these industry dynamics will contribute to growing demand for storage, staging, blending, export and other logistics services along the Gulf Coast, including at its Houston Ship Channel property. Accordingly, our sponsor is actively engaged in commercial negotiations with potential customers to provide solutions for both crude oil and refined products.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP:\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\nthese assets. We expect our expenses to remain relatively stable, but they may fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during a period and the timing of these expenditures.\nPrior to July 1, 2016, a member of the board of directors of USD exercised control over the VIEs, resulting in these entities being classified as related parties during that period. Related party sales to the special purpose entities were $0.8 million, $1.9 million and $1.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These sales are recorded in \"Fleet services-related party\" on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue generated by our Terminalling services segment increased $35.5 million to $100.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.This increase was largely due to our acquisition of the Casper terminal in mid-November of 2015, which provided an additional $28.1 million of revenue to our Terminalling services business in 2016. In addition, due to inflation-indexed rate escalations associated with our terminalling services agreements for our Hardisty terminal, we recognized more revenue for 2016 than we recognized during 2015, partially offset by additional amounts we deferred. Our terminalling services revenue was also affected by the decline in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Our terminalling services revenue would have been approximately $2.3 million greater if the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016, was the same as the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following table sets forth the operating results of our Fleet services business for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nOperating and maintenance. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $0.9 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our acquisition of the Casper terminal.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nHardisty Terminal Services Agreements. We have entered into terminal services agreements with seven high-quality, primarily investment grade counterparties or their subsidiaries: Cenovus Energy, Gibson, J. Aron & Company, Phillips 66, Suncor Energy, Total and USD Marketing LLC. Substantially all of the terminalling capacity at our Hardisty\nFinancing Activities\nOther Expenses\n \u2022 a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $3.5 million we recognized in connection with winding down our San Antonio Terminal operations, including an asset retirement obligation of $1.0 million for amounts we expect to spend to restore the property to its original condition; \n2017 termination of our customer contract for ethanol transloading services at our San Antonio terminal, including an asset retirement obligation of $1.0 million for amounts we expect to spend to restore the property to its original condition.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for our Terminalling services segment decreased by $1.0 million to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the lower average outstanding balance of our Term Loan Facility during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2015.\nUnder the terminal services agreements we have entered into with customers of our Hardisty terminal, our customers are obligated to pay the greater of a minimum monthly commitment fee or a throughput fee based on the actual volume of crude oil loaded at our Hardisty terminal. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its maximum allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit for up to six months to offset fees on throughput in excess of their minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. We record the portion of customer payments in excess of amounts paid for volumes actually shipped as deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet. Lower throughput volumes do not affect our Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, or our ability to pay our minimum quarterly distribution, since such deferred revenues do not affect our cash flow. We typically recognize as revenue any amounts we have deferred within six months when these make-up rights\u201d are either used or expire. The utilization or expiration of make-up rights will not affect our cash flows since the fees associated with such volumes were previously collected. Additional discussion regarding make-up rights and deferred revenues is included in Note 10. Deferred Revenues to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.\nIn November 2015, we amended our Credit Agreement to increase our total borrowing capacity from $300 million to $400 million, while all other terms and conditions of the existing Credit Agreement remained unchanged. We also reset our ability to request an additional $100 million of incremental Revolving Credit Facility commitments, subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders or other financial institutions and satisfaction of certain conditions.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is considered impaired when the sum of the estimated, undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Factors that indicate potential impairment include: a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset, and a significant change in the asset's physical condition or use.\nForeign Currency\nWe conduct our business through two distinct reporting segments: Terminalling services and Fleet services. We have established these reporting segments as strategic business units to facilitate the achievement of our long-term objectives, to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance.\n\n \u2022 non-cash losses associated with the revaluation of our foreign currency derivative instruments as compared with gains in the prior year due to a more stable exchange rate between the U.S. and Canada; and \nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF in this report provides information that enhances an investor's understanding of our ability to generate cash for payment of distributions and other purposes. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and DCF is \"Net cash provided by operating activities\". Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered an alternative to \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" or any other measure of liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF exclude some, but not all, items that affect cash from operations and these measures may vary among other companies. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nFreight and other reimbursables costs. Freight and other reimbursables costs decreased $0.6 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily resulting from a decrease in the costs for the delivery and shipment of railcars associated with the startup of our Hardisty terminal that occurred in 2014, partially offset by additional repairs and maintenance costs we incurred and passed through to our customers. Freight and other reimbursables costs were exactly offset by Freight and other reimbursables revenues.\nDebt Service\nThe $400 million Credit Agreement is comprised of a $300 million Revolving Credit Facility, and a $100 million Term Loan Facility (borrowed in Canadian dollars), with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The Credit Agreement is a five year committed facility that matures October 15, 2019, unless amended or extended.\nAssumptions we make under the income approach include our projections of future financial performance of the Casper terminal reporting unit, which include contract renewal expectations and commitments regarding the use of these facilities. To the extent that our assumptions for contract renewals and customer commitments vary from what we experience in the future, our projections of future financial performance underlying the fair value derived from the income approach of the Casper terminal reporting unit could yield results that are significantly different from those produced.\nagreements with strategic customers which would generate stable and predictable cash flows. Energy Capital Partners has indicated an intention to invest an additional $1.0 billion of equity capital in USD, subject to market and other conditions, to support future growth and expansion plans.\nRailroad Incentive Payments\n \u2022 declines in our fleet services business resulting from reductions to the number of railcars in our fleet; \nNet income for financial statement purposes may differ significantly from taxable income of unitholders as a result of differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and the taxable income allocation requirements under our partnership agreement. The aggregate difference in the basis of our net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined because information regarding each partner's tax attributes in us is not available.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nTerminalling Services Revenue\nRegulatory Environment\nWe incurred $238 thousand of maintenance capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily at our Casper terminal for environmental monitoring and security equipment. We had no maintenance capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We record routine maintenance expenses we incur in connection with the operation of our assets in \"Operating and maintenance\" expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $16.9 million to $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $36.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the cash flows produced by our Casper terminal, which we acquired in November 2015. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was partially offset by net changes in our working capital accounts resulting from the timing of receipts and payment of our accounts receivable and payable balances, as well as the increase in our restricted cash balances.\nWestern Canada\nCORPORATE ACTIVITIES\nFinancing\nOur benefit from income taxes for the Terminalling services segment was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with a provision for income taxes of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2016, prior to filing our 2015 Canadian tax returns, we adopted a methodology for determining the return attributable to the activities of our foreign subsidiaries based on the functions we provide and risks we manage on their behalf, which resulted in a reduction of our Canadian income tax liabilities for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. The resulting reduction of our Canadian income tax liabilities for 2015 was reflected as a decrease to our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in a net benefit from income taxes for 2016. We utilized net operating losses relating to our Canadian terminalling business during 2015, to the extent available, to offset Canadian taxable income generated in 2015. For 2016, we have no operating loss carryforwards available to apply towards future ordinary taxable income derived from our Canadian terminalling business.\nPursuant to the authoritative accounting guidance regarding uncertain tax positions, we recognize the tax effects of any uncertain tax position as the largest amount that will more likely than not be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority having full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Under this criterion, we evaluate the most likely resolution of an uncertain tax position based on its technical merits and on the outcome that we expect would likely be sustained under examination.\nWe anticipate using the cash flows generated by our Canadian subsidiaries to repay borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and borrowing up to the U.S. dollar equivalent amount under our Revolving Credit Facility, as necessary, to fund distributions to our unitholders. Following repayment of our Term Loan Facility and absent the incurrence of additional Canadian debt, we anticipate utilizing any excess cash flows produced by our Canadian subsidiaries to repay amounts they have borrowed from our U.S. entities, including us. Any amounts distributed by our Canadian subsidiaries to us in order to partially fund distributions to our unitholders, which are in excess of amounts they have borrowed from us, would be subject to Canadian withholding taxes.\nRight of First Offer\n (1) Corporate activities represent corporate and financing transactions that are not allocated to our established reporting segments. \nWe continue to proactively manage our operating costs in an effort to align with the current business environment, which may result in additional cost savings over the near term. However, we do not expect these benefits to remain over the long term as market and economic conditions improve.\nEnergy Capital Partners must approve any additional issuances of equity by us, which determinations may be made free of any duty to us or our unitholders. Members of our general partner's board of directors appointed by Energy Capital Partners must also approve the incurrence by us of additional indebtedness or refinancing outside of our existing indebtedness that is not in the ordinary course of business.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had amounts outstanding for the respective periods of $10.1 million and $41.5 million under the Term Loan Facility and $213.0 million and $201.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014, were largely driven by the following:\nThe approximately $33.6 million balance of our goodwill originated from our acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015 and is wholly attributed to this reporting unit. We measured the fair value of our Casper terminal reporting unit using customary business valuation techniques including an income analysis, market analysis and transaction analysis, which we weighted at 50%, 25% and 25%, respectively. The critical assumptions used in our analysis include the following:\n (1) Represents foreign exchange transaction amounts associated with activities between our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. \nRevenues from our Fleet services segment decreased $6.2 million to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the number of railcars directly leased by us to our customers, which also resulted in a $5.7 million decrease in Fleet leases, a corresponding $0.5 million decrease in Fleet services, and no notable changes in Freight and other reimbursables revenue. The Freight and other reimbursables revenues represent customer reimbursements to us for freight and other charges that we have incurred on behalf of our customers and were exactly offset by Freight and other reimbursables costs.\nCertain end users, including refineries across North America, have made substantial investments in recent years in order to efficiently process heavy grades of crude oil, such as those from Western Canada. Even with recent regulatory approvals, additions to pipeline takeaway capacity are not expected to keep pace with production growth over the next several years. As a result, multiple industry forecasts project demand for rail takeaway solutions will increase in 2017 and 2018. Our Hardisty and Casper terminals, with established capacity and scalable designs, are well-positioned as strategic locations to meet expected future takeaway needs.\nOperating costs of our fleet services segment increased $0.8 million to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in Fleet leases costs for our direct leases of railcars made on behalf of our customers, partially offset by decreases in Freight and other reimbursables and Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nGrowth Opportunities for our Operations\nRevenues for Terminalling services are recognized when services are provided based on the contractual rates related to throughput volumes. Our terminalling services agreements typically contain take-or-pay\u201d provisions whereby we are entitled to a minimum monthly commitment fee. In accordance with the terms of these agreements, we recognize the portions of these minimum monthly commitment fees paid for volumes in excess of actual throughput when the customer's ability to make up the minimum volume has expired, the throughput is utilized or when it is determined that the likelihood that the customer will utilize the make-up rights is remote. Revenue for Fleet services and related\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe following table summarizes our operating results by business segment and corporate charges for each of the years indicated:\n \u2022 a full year of costs related to our omnibus agreement and public partnership expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, that we did not incur prior to our IPO in October 2014; and \n (2) Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases for land, building, track, and railcars. \nA substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Canada and are accounted for in the local currency, the Canadian dollar, which we translate into our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. We translate most Canadian dollar denominated balance sheet accounts at the end of period exchange rate, while most income statement accounts are translated monthly based on the average exchange rate for each monthly period. Amounts translated from foreign currencies into our U.S. dollar reporting currency can vary between periods due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar.\nWe have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission which allows us to issue up to $500 million in aggregate offering price of common units, preferred units\nWestern Canadian crude oil production is projected to increase throughout the next decade, driven primarily by developments in Alberta's oil sands region. In June 2016, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers projected that the supply of crude oil from Western Canada will grow by approximately 590,000 Bpd by 2020 and 890,000 Bpd by 2025 relative to 2015. Since then, several companies have announced plans to increase production capacity at their oil sands facilities, in part due to cost savings and optimization achieved during the recent commodity price downturn.\nOur primary requirements for capital are for funding capital expenditures, including acquisitions and the costs we may incur to construct new assets, servicing our debt and making distributions to our unitholders.\nRevenues from our Fleet services segment increased $3.7 million to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet leases associated with the Hardisty terminal being in service for the full year in 2015 and only one-half of the year in 2014, coupled with additional fleet services revenue resulting from railcar management services provided to affiliates of USD.", "item_7_tables": "Table 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

prior years, primarily due to the acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015 and the Hardisty terminal becoming fully operational in 2015 after starting operations in mid-2014. \n\n- Operating income also increased for Terminalling Services in 2016 and 2015 due to the contributions from the Casper and Hardisty terminals.\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) increased significantly in 2016 and 2015 compared to 2014, again driven by the Hardisty and Casper terminal acquisitions. \n\n- Revenue for the Fleet Services segment decreased in 2016 compared to 2015, due to a reduction in the number of railcars leased directly to customers. Operating income also declined for Fleet Services in 2016.\n\n- The company repaid debt on its Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility in 2016 using excess cash flow. It expects to continue reducing debt moving forward.\n\n- The company adopted a new methodology for determining taxable income of foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a reduction of tax liabilities for 2015 and 2016. This was a key driver of decreased tax expense in 2016.\n\n- Industry forecasts project growing demand for rail transportation of crude oil, which should benefit the company's Hardisty and Casper terminals. However, contract renewals represent a risk factor.\n\nIn summary, the acquisition of the Casper and Hardisty terminals drove improved financial performance, while debt repayment and lower taxes also contributed to positive results in 2016. Industry dynamics appear favorable for the company's rail terminals, but contract renewals present some uncertainty."}
