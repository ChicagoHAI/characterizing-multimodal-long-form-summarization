In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\n\ufeff\nOverview\nWe are one of the world's leading transportation finance and logistics companies. We purchase equipment, primarily intermodal shipping containers and railcars, which we lease to our customers. We also manage equipment for third-party investors. In operating our fleet, we lease, re-lease and dispose of equipment and contract for the repair, repositioning and storage of equipment. We also provide domestic and international logistics services. As of December 31, 2018, our container fleet comprised 1,568,707 CEUs, 96% of which represented our owned fleet and 4% of which represented our managed fleet. In addition, we also own 7,279 railcars, which we lease within North America.\nOur revenue comprises container lease revenue and rail lease revenue from our owned container and railcar fleets, management fee revenue for managing containers for third-party investors, and logistics revenue for the provision of logistics services.\nOur container and rail lease revenue from our owned fleets depends primarily upon a combination of: (1) the number of units in our owned fleet; (2) the utilization level of equipment in our owned fleet; and (3) the per diem rates charged under each equipment lease. The same factors in our managed fleet affect the amount of our management fee income. The number of CEUs in our container fleet, and the number of cars in our railcar fleet, varies over time as we purchase new equipment based on prevailing market conditions during the year and sell used equipment to parties in the secondary resale market.\nKey Metrics\nUtilization. We measure container utilization on the basis of the average number of CEUs on lease expressed as a percentage of our total container fleet available for lease. We measure railcar utilization on the basis of the average number of railcars on lease expressed as a percentage of our total railcar fleet available for lease. In both cases, we calculate the total fleet available for lease by excluding new units that have been manufactured for us but either remain at the manufacturer or have not yet entered their first lease, and off-hire units that are likely to be sold. Our utilization is primarily driven by the overall level of equipment demand, the location of our available equipment and the quality of our relationships with equipment lessees. The location of available equipment is critical because equipment available in high-demand locations is more readily leased and is typically leased on more favorable terms than equipment available in low-demand locations.\nThe equipment leasing market is highly competitive. As such, our relationships with our customers are important to ensure that they continue to select us as one of their providers of leased equipment. Our average container fleet utilization rate in CEUs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 99.2% compared to 97.4% and 92.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in our average fleet utilization from 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in demand for leased containers that continued from 2017. Our average railcar fleet utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 88.6% compared to 90.0% and 93.9% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If new railcars not yet leased are included in the total railcar fleet, railcar fleet utilization would be 81.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in the utilization of our railcar fleet has been primarily caused by decreased demand and competitive pressure in the rail market. Our utilization rate may increase or decrease depending on future global economic conditions and the additional supply of new equipment.\nPer Diem Rates. The per diem rate for a lease is set at the time we enter into a lease agreement. Our long-term per diem rates have historically been strongly influenced by new equipment pricing, interest rates, the balance of supply and demand for equipment at a particular time and location, our estimate of the residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease, the type and age of the equipment being leased, and, for container per diem rates, the purchase of equipment and efficiencies in container utilization by container shipping lines. The overall average per diem rates for equipment in our owned fleet and in the portfolios of equipment comprising our managed fleet do not change significantly in response to changes in new equipment prices because existing lease agreements can only be re-priced upon the expiration of the lease.\nRevenue\nOur revenue is comprised of container lease revenue, rail lease revenue, and logistics revenue.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nContainer Lease Revenue. We generate container lease revenue by leasing our owned containers primarily to container shipping lines. Approximately 96% of our container lease revenue is derived from the rental of containers. Container lease revenue is comprised of monthly lease payments due under the lease agreements together with payments for other charges set forth in the leases, such as handling fees, drop-off charges and repair charges. Approximately 22% of our owned container fleet is subject to finance leases. Under a finance lease, the lessee's payments consist of principal and interest components. The interest component is included within container lease revenue. Lessees under our finance leases have the substantive risks and rewards of equipment ownership and typically have the option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term for a nominal amount.\nContainer lease revenue also includes management fee revenue generated by our management services, which include the leasing, re-leasing, repair, repositioning, storage and disposition of equipment. We provide these management services pursuant to management agreements with third-party investors. Under these agreements, which have multiple year terms, we earn fees for the management of the equipment and a commission, or a managed units' sales fee, upon disposition of equipment under management.\nRail Lease Revenue. We generate rail lease revenue by leasing our railcars primarily for the transport of industrial goods, materials and other products on railroad tracks throughout North America. Rail lease revenue is comprised of monthly lease payments due under the lease agreements. Lease revenue may be based on a fixed monthly rate or may be recognized on an hourly or mileage basis. None of our railcars are subject to finance leases.\nLogistics Revenue. We generate logistics revenue by arranging for the movement of our customers' freight through our network of non-affiliated transportation carriers and equipment providers. Revenue is comprised of the gross price charged to our customers.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses include transportation costs, depreciation of rental equipment, storage, handling and other expenses applicable to our owned equipment, and administrative expenses.\nWe depreciate our containers on a straight-line basis over a period ranging from 12 to 15 years to a fixed estimated residual value depending on the type of container (see Note 2(c) to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We regularly assess both the estimated useful life of our containers and their expected residual values, and, when warranted, adjust our depreciation estimate accordingly. Railcar equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful life of 43 years to its estimated residual value using the straight-line method. Depreciation expense for rental equipment will vary over time based upon the size of our owned rental equipment fleet and the purchase price of new equipment. If our rental equipment is impaired, the equipment is written-down to its fair value and the amount of the write-down is recorded in depreciation expense.\nStorage, handling and other expenses are operating costs of our owned rental equipment fleet. Storage and handling expenses occur when lessees drop off equipment at depots at the end of a lease. Storage and handling expenses vary significantly by location. Other expenses include repair expenses, which are the result of normal wear and tear on the equipment, and repositioning expenses, which are incurred when we contract to move equipment from locations where our inventories exceed actual or expected demand to locations with higher demand. Storage, handling and other expenses are directly related to the number of units in our owned fleet and inversely related to our utilization rate for those units: as utilization increases, we typically have lower storage, handling and repositioning expenses.\nLogistics transportation costs represent the expenses we incur for providing logistics services to our customers. Such costs include shipping, pick-up and delivery charges, primarily from railroads and drayage companies we contract with to fulfill the movement of our customers' freight.\nOur administrative expenses are primarily employee-related costs such as salary, bonus and commission expenses, employee benefits, rent, allowance for doubtful accounts and travel and entertainment costs, as well as expenses incurred for outside services such as legal, consulting and audit-related fees.\nOur operating expenses include the gain or loss on sale of used rental equipment. This gain or loss is typically the result of our sale of used equipment in the secondary resale market and is the difference between: (1) the cash we receive for these units, less selling expenses; and (2) the net book value of the units.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017

Excluding this one-off benefit and other discrete items, the effective tax rate was 3.6% and related income tax expense was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 remained relatively consistent at 3.5%.\nThe decrease in income tax expense between 2017 and 2016 was mainly attributable to a $16.9 million tax benefit arising from the Tax Act that reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities, and a benefit of $1.8 million related to stock-based compensation excess tax benefits, partially offset by $1.9 million of tax expense related to prior year true-ups. Excluding these items, income tax expense was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 47%, compared to the prior year. Excluding the items noted above, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.6% compared to an effective tax rate of 39% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to an increase in the proportion of pretax income generated in lower tax jurisdictions by our container leasing business, and a corresponding decrease in the proportion of pretax income generated in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily by our railcar business.\nNote 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a reconciliation between the tax expense calculated at the statutory U.S. income tax rate and the actual tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $45.3 million, including $25.2 million of cash held by VIEs. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash in-flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity and debt offerings.

Based on the borrowing base and collateral requirements as of December 31, 2018, the borrowing availability under our revolving credit facilities was $111.2 million, assuming no additional contributions of assets.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1,358.3 million of total debt outstanding on facilities with fixed interest rates. These fixed rate facilities are scheduled to mature between 2019 and 2043, and had a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $821.0 million of total debt outstanding on facilities with interest rates based on floating rate indices (primarily LIBOR). These floating rate facilities are schedule to mature between 2019 and 2023, and had a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% as of December 31, 2018.\nWe have typically funded a significant portion of the purchase price for new equipment through borrowings under our credit facilities. However, from time to time we have funded new equipment acquisitions through the use of working capital.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nWe have three revolving credit facilities, which have a maximum borrowing capacity of $1,100.0 million, $550.0 million, and \u20ac25.0 million, respectively, and maturity dates of June 2023, October 2023, and September 2020, respectively. The entire amount of the facilities drawn at any time plus accrued interest and fees is callable on demand in the event of certain specified events of default.\nWe use the revolving credit facilities primarily to fund the purchase of rental equipment. As of December 31, 2018, in addition to a rental equipment payable of $74.1 million, we had commitments to purchase $9.4 million of containers and $64.4 million of railcars in the twelve months ending December 31, 2019.\nTerm Loans\nWe utilize our term loans as an important funding source for the purchase of rental equipment. Our term loans amortize in monthly or quarterly installments and mature between October 2019 and October 2023.\nSenior Secured Notes\nWe used the proceeds from the senior secured notes primarily to fund the purchase of rental equipment. The notes amortize in semi-annual installments and mature in September 2022.\nAsset-Backed Notes\nOur asset-backed notes were issued by two of our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, which were established to facilitate asset-backed note financings. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the asset-backed notes primarily to repay part of our borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility and to reduce the balance on one of our term loans.\nOur borrowings under the asset-backed facilities amortize in monthly installments and mature between October 2027 and September 2043. We are required to maintain a restricted cash account to cover payments of the obligations. As of December 31, 2018, the restricted cash account had a balance of $30.7 million.\nOther Debt Obligations\nWe have entered into a series of collateralized financing obligations with Japanese investor funds that are consolidated by us as VIEs (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The obligations have maturity dates between March 2019 and December 2021.\nOne of our Japanese investor funds that is consolidated by us as a VIE entered into a term loan agreement with a bank. The VIE term loan matures in June 2019.\nOur term loans, senior secured notes, asset-backed notes, collateralized financing obligations and term loans held by VIEs are secured by specific pools of rental equipment and other assets owned by the Company, the underlying leases thereon and the Company's interest in any money received under such contracts.\nIn addition to customary events of default, our revolving credit facilities and term loans contain restrictive covenants, including limitations on certain liens, indebtedness and investments. In addition, all of our debt facilities contain various restrictive financial and other covenants. The financial covenants in our debt facilities require us to maintain (1) a consolidated funded debt to consolidated tangible net worth ratio of no more than 3.75:1.00, and in the case of our asset-backed notes, of no more than 4.50:1:00; and (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.20:1.00, and in the case of our asset-backed notes, of at least 1.10:1.00. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.\nUnder certain conditions, as defined in our credit agreements with our banks and/or note holders, we are subject to certain cross default provisions that may result in an acceleration of principal repayment under these credit facilities if an uncured default condition were to exist. Our asset-backed notes are not subject to any such cross-default provisions.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCash Flow\nThe following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\ufeff\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>78,596 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>72,060 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>6,034 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income adjusted for non-cash items\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>200,965 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>168,719 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>131,013 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChanges in working capital\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(21,195) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(13,527) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,757) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>179,770 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>155,192 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>129,256 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(663,343) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(411,751) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(181,600) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>512,350 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>251,222 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>45,579 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect on cash of foreign currency translation\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(3) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>220 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(674) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>28,774 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(5,117) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(7,439) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and restricted cash at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>47,209 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>52,326 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>59,765 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and restricted cash at end of period\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>75,983 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>47,209 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>52,326 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $179.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased $24.6 million from $155.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to a $32.2 million increase in net income as adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items, partially offset by a decrease of $7.7 million in our net working capital adjustments. The increase in net income as adjusted for non-cash items was primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in net income, a $10.2 million increase in depreciation expense, a $17.4 million increase in deferred income taxes, a $2.2 million reduction in contingent consideration, and a $1.0 million increase in amortization of debt issuance costs, partially offset by a $6.4 million increase in gain on sale of used rental equipment. Net working capital used in operating activities of $21.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, was due to a $19.3 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily caused by an increase in lease and logistics activity and a $2.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets as a result of an increase in initial direct costs related to new railcar leases.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $155.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $25.9 million from $129.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to a $37.7 million increase in net income as adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items, partially offset by a decrease of $11.8 million in our net working capital adjustments. The increase in net income as adjusted for non-cash items was primarily due to a $66.0 million increase in net income, a $6.1 million increase in depreciation expense, and a $1.6 million reduction in contingent consideration, partially offset by an $18.0 million increase in gain on sale of used rental equipment, a $16.1 million decrease in deferred income taxes, and a $2.7 million decrease in bad debt expense as a result of the Hanjin bankruptcy. Net working capital used in operating activities of $13.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to a $5.0 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily caused by an increase in lease and logistics activity, a $2.2 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, primarily caused by a decrease in accrued tax expense as a result of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards, a $5.8 million decrease in due to container investors due to the decrease in our managed fleet, and a $1.3 million decrease in unearned revenue.\nInvesting Activities Cash Flows\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $251.6 million to $663.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $411.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash usage was primarily attributable to a $310.0 million increase in the purchase of rental equipment, partially offset by a $39.8 million increase in proceeds from sale of used rental equipment and a $19.3 million increase in receipt of principal payments from direct financing leases.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $230.2 million to $411.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash usage was primarily attributable to a $250.9 million increase in the purchase of rental equipment, partially offset by a $15.6 million decrease in acquisition costs and a $4.4 million increase in receipt of principal payments from direct financing leases.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFinancing Activities Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $512.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $261.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of higher net borrowings being required to finance the acquisition of rental equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash inflow from borrowings was $458.2 million compared to $226.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting an increase in investment in rental equipment during 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was also attributable to an increase of $75.4 million in proceeds received from issuances of common stock under our At-the-Market (ATM) offering program and issuances of Preferred Stock in underwritten offerings and Series A Preferred Stock under our Series A Preferred Stock ATM offering program, partially offset by a $40.9 million increase in the repurchase of our common stock.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $251.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $205.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of higher net borrowings being required to finance the acquisition of rental equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash inflow from borrowings was $226.5 million compared to $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting an increase in investment in rental equipment during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was also attributable to an increase of $28.0 million in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our ATM offering program and a decrease of $9.2 million used to repurchase our common stock, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in debt issuance costs, primarily related to the asset-backed notes issued in 2017.\nEquity Transactions\nStock Repurchase Plan\nIn May 2018, we purchased, and subsequently cancelled, 1.2 million shares of our common stock, from an affiliate of Andrew S. Ogawa in a privately-negotiated transaction. Mr. Ogawa is a member of our Board of Directors. The stock was purchased at a price of $22.81 per share, which represented a 2% discount to the closing price as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of purchase.\nIn October 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to three million shares of our outstanding common stock. The number, price, structure and timing of the repurchases, if any, will be at our sole discretion and will be evaluated by us depending on market conditions, corporate needs and other factors. Stock repurchases may be made in the open market, block trades or privately negotiated transactions. This stock repurchase program replaced any available prior share repurchase authorization and may be discontinued at any time. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased 541,743 shares of our common stock under this repurchase plan, at a cost of approximately $12.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 2.5 million shares remained available for repurchase under our share repurchase plan.\nCommon Stock ATM Offering Program\ufeff\nIn October 2017, we commenced an ATM offering program with respect to our common stock, which allows us to issue and sell up to 2.0 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we had issued 888,453 shares of common stock and had remaining capacity to issue up to approximately 1.1 million of additional shares of common stock under the ATM offering program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued 100,000 shares of common stock under the ATM offering program for net proceeds of $2.8 million. We paid commissions to the sales agent of $0.1 million in connection with the sales of common stock under this ATM offering program during the year ended December 31, 2018. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, we have remaining capacity to issue up to approximately 1.0 million of additional shares of common stock under this ATM offering program. \ufeff\nSeries A Preferred Stock Underwritten Offering\ufeff\nIn March 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,600,000 shares of our 8.50% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share and liquidation preference $25.00 per share (Series A Preferred Stock), resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $38.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. \ufeffIn April 2018, we sold an additional 170,900 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock upon the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Series A Preferred Stock, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $4.1 million, after deducting the underwriting discount. \ufeffThe net proceeds were used for repayment of debt and general corporate purposes.\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our Series A Preferred Stock. \ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSeries A Preferred Stock ATM Offering Program\ufeff\nIn May 2018, we commenced an ATM offering program with respect to our Series A Preferred Stock, which allows us to issue and sell up to 2.2 million shares of our Series A Preferred Stock.

As of December 31, 2018, we have remaining capacity to issue up to approximately 1.8 million of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock under this ATM program. \ufeff\nSeries B Preferred Stock Underwritten Offering\ufeff\nIn August 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,700,000 shares of our 8.50% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share and liquidation preference $25.00 per share (Series B Preferred Stock), resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $41.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. We sold an additional 255,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock upon the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Series B Preferred Stock, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $6.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount. \ufeffThe net proceeds were used for repayment of debt and general corporate purposes.\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our Series B Preferred Stock.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table

relating to our senior secured notes, $176.5 million relating to our asset-backed notes, $2.2 million relating to our collateralized financing obligations, and less than $0.1 million related to our term loans held by VIEs. The calculation of interest commitment related to our debt assumes the following weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2018: revolving credit facilities, 4.1%; term loans, 4.1%; senior secured notes, 4.9%; asset-backed notes, 4.0%; collateralized financing obligations, 1.2%; and term loans held by VIEs, 3.3%. These calculations assume that interest rates will remain at the same level over the next five years. We expect that interest rates will vary over time based upon fluctuations in the underlying indexes upon which these interest rates are based.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the terms of our revolving credit facilities, term loans and asset-based notes.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, change in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditure, or capital resources that are material to investors. An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which we would have: (1) retained a contingent interest in transferred assets; (2) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity; (3) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us; or (4) made guarantees.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. We have identified the policies and estimates below as among those critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies and estimates are considered critical due to the existence of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made, the likelihood of changes in estimates from period to period and the potential impact that these estimates can have on our financial statements. The following accounting policies and estimates include inherent risks and uncertainties related to judgments and assumptions made by us. Our estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe provide a range of services to our customers incorporating rental, sale and management of equipment, and the provision of logistics services. Revenue for all forms of service is recognized when earned following the guidelines under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue Recognition and FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases. Revenue is reported net of any related sales tax.\nContainer and Rail Lease Revenue\nWe recognize revenue from operating leases of our owned equipment as earned over the term of the lease. Where minimum lease payments vary over the lease term, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We recognize revenue on a cash basis for certain railcar leases that are billed on an hourly or mileage basis through a third-party railcar manager. Early termination of the rental contracts subjects the lessee to a penalty, which is included in lease revenue upon such termination. Finance lease income is recognized using the effective interest method, which generates a constant rate of interest over the period of the lease. Included in lease revenue is revenue consisting primarily of fees charged to the lessee for handling, delivery, and repairs, which are recognized as earned.\nWe cease recognition of lease revenue if and when a lessee defaults in making timely lease payments or we otherwise determine that future lease payments are not likely to be collected from the lessee. Our determination of the collectability of future lease payments is made by management on the basis of available information, including the current creditworthiness of lessees, historical collection results and review of specific past due receivables. If we experience unexpected payment defaults from our lessees, we will cease accruing rental revenue as earned and will recognize revenue as cash is received.\nAlso included in lease revenue is revenue from management fees earned under equipment management agreements. Management fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the monthly net operating income for an investor's portfolio and recognized as revenue in the month of service.\nLogistics Revenue\nOur logistics business derives its revenue from three principal sources: (1) truck brokerage services, (2) intermodal transportation services, and (3) international ocean freight and freight forwarding services. For truck brokerage services, which typically involve a short transit time, revenue is recognized when delivery has been completed due to the lack of reliable information to reasonably measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. For intermodal transportation services, which can take a longer time to complete, revenue is recognized over time by measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, utilizing input methods. For any such services not completed at the end of a reporting period, we use a percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period. We provide international freight forwarding services as an indirect carrier, sometimes referred to as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier. Due to the lack of reliable information to reasonably measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, revenue from these shipments is recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin, which is when the customer is billed and we have no further obligation to the customer.\nWe report logistics revenue on a gross basis as we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified service desired by the customer and have discretion in establishing the price for the specified service.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRental Equipment\nContainer\nWe purchase new container equipment from manufacturers to lease to our customers. We also purchase used container equipment through sale-leaseback transactions with our customers, or equipment that was previously owned by one of our third party investors. Used equipment is typically purchased with an existing lease in place.\nContainer rental equipment is recorded at original cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives and residual values of our container equipment are based on historical disposal experience and our expectations for future used container sale prices. Depreciation estimates are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether sustained changes have taken place in the useful lives of our equipment or assigned residual values, which would suggest that a change in depreciation estimates is warranted.\nIn considering changes to residual values for the three major dry van categories and two refrigerated container categories, we reviewed 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, and 13-year average disposition pricing trends. As with all estimates, particularly related to long-lived assets, current market performance may not necessarily be indicative of long-term residual values, so we do not adjust residual values to point-in-time prices. Rather, we consider the mix of data shown in the following tables and use the average over time to either confirm residual value estimates or support revisions to those estimates.\nThe sale-related unit proceeds by dry van and refrigerated container category that we considered as of October 31, 2018, when we performed our annual residual value analysis, are shown below:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCategory\n</td> <td>\n3-year Avg.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5-year Avg.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n7-year Avg.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n13-year Avg.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n20-ft. standard dry van container\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>977 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,025 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,104 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,124 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n40-ft. standard dry van container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,086 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,202 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,321 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,348 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n40-ft. high cube dry van container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,137 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,251 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,357 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,439 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n20-ft. refrigerated container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,903 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,181 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n40-ft. high cube refrigerated container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,353 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,058 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOur residual value estimates ($1,050 for a 20-ft. dry van, $1,300 for a 40-ft. dry van, and $1,400 for a 40-ft. high cube dry van) are slightly higher than the 3-year and 5-year average sale price for all equipment types and the 7-year average for 40-ft. high cube dry vans. While we experienced losses when selling certain of these assets during 2015 and 2016, there was a recovery in prices during 2017 that has continued into 2018, resulting in gains on sale of our equipment. Due to this cyclical nature in the container market, we do not adjust long-term residual value estimates based on short-term data points, such as current year sale results, the 3-year average and even the 5-year average shown above, as we do not believe they are indicative of a change in the long-term market value for these containers. As such, no change to the residual values of dry van containers was considered necessary during the year ended December 31, 2018. We regularly review this data and update our analysis, and will make revisions to residual value estimates as and when conditions warrant.\nThe largest segment of our non-dry van container fleet consists of 20-ft. refrigerated containers and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers. We regularly review the residual value estimates associated with our refrigerated containers. Given the specific nature of these assets and the lower volumes of containers that are sold each year in the secondary market, not always at the end of the container's life, there is more variability in asset pricing. Similar to our dry van containers, we evaluate the relationship between sales prices and residual values over a long-term horizon. We excluded 7-year and 13-year historical averages from our analysis as we do not have a long enough history of sales for refrigerated containers. The current residual values for 20-ft. refrigerated and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers are set at $2,750 and $3,500, respectively. Based on the data trends, we believe that the residual value estimates for our refrigerated containers are appropriate and do not warrant revision.\nThe estimated useful lives and residual values for the majority of our container equipment purchased new from the factory are as follows:\n\ufeff\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDepreciable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nResidual Value\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLife in Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n20-ft. standard dry van container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,050 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n13.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n40-ft. standard dry van container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,300 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n13.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n40-ft. high cube dry van container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,400 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n13.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n20-ft. refrigerated container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,750 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n12.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n40-ft. high cube refrigerated container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,500 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n12.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOther specialized equipment is depreciated to its estimated residual value, which ranges from $1,000 to $3,500, over its estimated useful life of between 12.5 years and 15 years.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFor used container equipment acquired through sale-leaseback transactions, we often adjust our estimates for remaining useful life and residual values based on current conditions in the sale market for older containers and our expectations for how long the equipment will remain on-hire to the current lessee.\nRail\nRailcar equipment is recorded at original cost and depreciated over its estimated useful life of 43 years to its estimated residual value of $8,700 using the straight-line method. We determine the useful life based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenue. Residual value is based on the average estimated scrap value of our railcars. We periodically review the appropriateness of our estimates of useful life and residual value based on changes in economic circumstances and other factors.\nOur railcars may undergo refurbishment and upgrade programs to, for example, extend their useful life, meet higher car classification grades, enter new product or service segments, increase the tonnage carried, or to achieve higher utilization. The costs for these programs are capitalized.\nNormal repairs and maintenance associated with our railcar assets are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOn at least an annual basis, we evaluate our rental equipment fleet to determine whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of all, or part, of our fleet may not be recoverable. Events which would trigger an impairment review include, among others, a significant decrease in the long-term average market value of rental equipment, a significant decrease in the utilization rate of rental equipment resulting in an inability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods, or a change in market conditions resulting in a significant decrease in lease rates.\nWhen testing for impairment, equipment is generally grouped by equipment type, and is tested separately from other groups of assets and liabilities. Potential impairment exists when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group, comprised of lease proceeds and residual values, less related operating expenses, are less than the carrying value of that asset group. If potential impairment exists, the equipment is written down to its fair value. In determining the fair value of an asset group, we consider market trends, published value for similar assets, recent transactions of similar assets and in certain cases, quotes from third party appraisers. No impairment charges were recorded in 2018, 2017 and 2016 as a result of our annual review.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which requires lessors to classify leases as a sales-type, direct financing, or operating lease. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, and ASU 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors. A lease is a sales-type lease if any of five criteria are met, each of which indicate that the lease, in effect, transfers control of the underlying asset to the lessee. If none of those five criteria are met, but two additional criteria are both met, indicating that the lessor has transferred substantially all of the risks and benefits of the underlying asset to the lessee and a third-party, the lease is a direct financing lease. All leases that are not sales-type or direct financing leases are operating leases. The new standard also established a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize an ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than twelve months.\nThe new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either (1) its effective date or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. If an entity chooses the second option, the transitions requirements for existing leases also apply to leases entered into between the date of initial application and the effective date. The entity must also recast its comparative period financial statements and provide the disclosures required by the new standard for the comparative periods. We expect to adopt the new standard on January 1, 2019 and use the effective date as our date of initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019.\nThe new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We expect to elect (1) the package of practical expedients\u201d, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs, (2) the short-term lease recognition exemption for our office space leases of twelve months or less, which means we will not recognize an ROU asset or lease liability for these leases, and (3) the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases. We do not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to us.\nWe have completed our full assessment of adopting the new standard and have determined that adoption will not have a material effect on our financial statements and related disclosures.", "item_7_truncated": "\t\t\nRail Leasing\nWe have completed our

There was also an increase in the proportion of new railcars in the fleet leading to higher depreciation per railcar.\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2018 vs 2017\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2017 vs 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in thousand)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRail lease revenue\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>35,703 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>32,476 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>30,490 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,227 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>10% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,986 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in container lease revenue between 2018 and 2017 was a result of a $54.2 million increase in rental revenue, primarily due to a 25% increase in the average number of CEUs of on-lease owned containers, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in rental revenue resulting from a 1% decrease in average owned container per diem rental rates, and $2.2 million of container lease revenue from insurance proceeds recognized in 2017 that was not recurring in 2018.

us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either (1) its effective date or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. If an entity chooses the second option, the transitions requirements for existing leases also apply to leases entered into between the date of initial application and the effective date.

We generate container lease revenue by leasing our owned containers primarily to container shipping lines. Approximately 96% of our container lease revenue is derived from the rental of containers. Container lease revenue is comprised of monthly lease payments due under the lease agreements together with payments for other charges set forth in the leases, such as handling fees, drop-off charges and repair charges. Approximately 22% of our owned container fleet is subject to finance leases. Under a finance lease, the lessee's payments consist of principal and interest components. The interest component is included within container lease revenue. Lessees under our finance leases have the substantive risks and rewards of equipment ownership and typically have the option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term for a nominal amount.\n\ufeff\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDepreciable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nResidual Value\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLife in Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n20-ft. standard dry van container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,050 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n13.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n40-ft. standard dry van container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,300 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n13.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n40-ft. high cube dry van container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,400 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n13.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n20-ft. refrigerated container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,750 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n12.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n40-ft. high cube refrigerated container\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,500 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n12.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContainer lease revenue also includes management fee revenue generated by our management services, which include the leasing, re-leasing, repair, repositioning, storage and disposition of equipment.

The calculation of interest commitment related to our debt assumes the following weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2018: revolving credit facilities, 4.1%; term loans, 4.1%; senior secured notes, 4.9%; asset-backed notes, 4.0%; collateralized financing obligations, 1.2%; and term loans held by VIEs, 3.3%. These calculations assume that interest rates will remain at the same level over the next five years.

provided by financing activities of $251.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $205.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of higher net borrowings being required to finance the acquisition of rental equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash inflow from borrowings was $226.5 million compared to $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting an increase in investment in rental equipment during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was also attributable to an increase of $28.0 million in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our ATM offering program and a decrease of $9.2 million used to repurchase our common stock, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in debt issuance costs, primarily related to the asset-backed notes issued in 2017.\nTerm Loans\nTable 25: <table> <tr>

impairment, equipment is generally grouped by equipment type, and is tested separately from other groups of assets and liabilities. Potential impairment exists when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group, comprised of lease proceeds and residual values, less related operating expenses, are less than the carrying value of that asset group. If potential impairment exists, the equipment is written down to its fair value. In determining the fair value of an asset group, we consider market trends, published value for similar assets, recent transactions of similar assets and in certain cases, quotes from third party appraisers. No impairment charges were recorded in 2018, 2017 and 2016 as a result of our annual review.\nRail Leasing\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. We have identified the policies and estimates below as among those critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies and estimates are considered critical due to the existence of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made, the likelihood of changes in estimates from period to period and the potential impact that these estimates can have on our financial statements. The following accounting policies and estimates include inherent risks and uncertainties related to judgments and assumptions made by us. Our estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\t\t\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe cease recognition of lease revenue if and when a lessee defaults in making timely lease payments or we otherwise determine that future lease payments are not likely to be collected from the lessee. Our determination of the collectability of future lease payments is made by management on the basis of available information, including the current creditworthiness of lessees, historical collection results and review of specific past due receivables. If we experience unexpected payment defaults from our lessees, we will cease accruing rental revenue as earned and will recognize revenue as cash is received.\n\t\t\nWe report logistics revenue on a gross basis as we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified service desired by the customer and have discretion in establishing the price for the specified service.\nRail Lease Revenue. We generate rail lease revenue by leasing our railcars primarily for the transport of industrial goods, materials and other products on railroad tracks throughout North America. Rail lease revenue is comprised of monthly lease payments due under the lease agreements. Lease revenue may be based on a fixed monthly rate or may be recognized on an hourly or mileage basis. None of our railcars are subject to finance leases.\nSeries A Preferred Stock Underwritten Offering\ufeff\nRail Leasing\nContainer Leasing\nThe increase in depreciation expense between 2018 and 2017 was primarily attributable to a 12% increase in the average size of our owned fleet between the two periods, partially offset by a $1.3 million one-time write-off of rental equipment on lease to a bankrupt customer, which was recognized in 2017, and an increase in assets on direct finance leases.\n\nNet interest expense\n\nEquity Transactions\nThe increase in container lease revenue between 2017 and 2016 was a result of a $35.2 million increase in rental revenue, primarily due to a 19% increase in the average number of CEUs of on-lease owned containers, partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in rental revenue resulting from a 3% decrease in average owned container per diem rental rates, and a decrease of $1.4 million reflecting lost revenue related to the bankruptcy of Hanjin in 2016, net of $2.2 million of insurance proceeds for lost lease rental revenue, recognized in 2017. The reduction in average container per diem rental rates has been primarily caused by competitive market pressure.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1,081.4 million in availability under our revolving credit facilities (net of $0.1 million in letters of credit), subject to our ability to meet the collateral requirements under the agreements governing the facilities. Based on the borrowing base and collateral requirements as of December 31, 2018, the borrowing availability under our revolving credit facilities was $111.2 million, assuming no additional contributions of assets.\n\t\t\nOther expense, being a loss on foreign exchange, of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 remained relatively consistent with other expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nThe largest segment of our non-dry van container fleet consists of 20-ft. refrigerated containers and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers. We regularly review the residual value estimates associated with our refrigerated containers. Given the specific nature of these assets and the lower volumes of containers that are sold each year in the secondary market, not always at the end of the container's life, there is more variability in asset pricing. Similar to our dry van containers, we evaluate the relationship between sales prices and residual values over a long-term horizon. We excluded 7-year and 13-year historical averages from our analysis as we do not have a long enough history of sales for refrigerated containers. The current residual values for 20-ft. refrigerated and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers are set at $2,750 and $3,500, respectively. Based on the data trends, we believe that the residual value estimates for our refrigerated containers are appropriate and do not warrant revision.\nRailcar equipment is recorded at original cost and depreciated over its estimated useful life of 43 years to its estimated residual value of $8,700 using the straight-line method. We determine the useful life based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenue. Residual value is based on the average estimated scrap value of our railcars. We periodically review the appropriateness of our estimates of useful life and residual value based on changes in economic circumstances and other factors.\nContainer Leasing\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We expect to elect (1) the package of practical expedients\u201d, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs, (2) the short-term lease recognition exemption for our office space leases of twelve months or less, which means we will not recognize an ROU asset or lease liability for these leases, and (3) the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases. We do not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to us.\n\ufeff\nContainer Leasing\nUnder certain conditions, as defined in our credit agreements with our banks and/or note holders, we are subject to certain cross default provisions that may result in an acceleration of principal repayment under these credit facilities if an uncured default condition were to exist. Our asset-backed notes are not subject to any such cross-default provisions.\nOur operating expenses include the gain or loss on sale of used rental equipment. This gain or loss is typically the result of our sale of used equipment in the secondary resale market and is the difference between: (1) the cash we receive for these units, less selling expenses; and (2) the net book value of the units.\n\t\t\t\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\ufeff\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $821.0 million of total debt outstanding on facilities with interest rates based on floating rate indices (primarily LIBOR). These floating rate facilities are schedule to mature between 2019 and 2023, and had a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% as of December 31, 2018.\nRental Equipment\n\ufeff\nNote 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a reconciliation between the tax expense calculated at the statutory U.S. income tax rate and the actual tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\nContainer and Rail Lease Revenue\nRail lease revenue increased between 2018 and 2017, primarily as a result of a 14% increase in the average size of our on-lease railcar fleet and a 2% increase in rental rates, partially offset by a $1.0 million settlement with a customer for damaged railcars recognized in 2017.\nContainer lease revenue\n\t\t\t\nIn considering changes to residual values for the three major dry van categories and two refrigerated container categories, we reviewed 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, and 13-year average disposition pricing trends. As with all estimates, particularly related to long-lived assets, current market performance may not necessarily be indicative of long-term residual values, so we do not adjust residual values to point-in-time prices. Rather, we consider the mix of data shown in the following tables and use the average over time to either confirm residual value estimates or support revisions to those estimates.\nThe sale-related unit proceeds by dry van and refrigerated container category that we considered as of October 31, 2018, when we performed our annual residual value analysis, are shown below:\nOperating Activities Cash Flows\n\t\t\t\nWe recorded a gain of $1.8 million on the sale of used rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a gain of less than $0.1 million in 2017, and a loss of less than $0.1 million in 2016, respectively. The $1.8 million gain in 2018 resulted from the sale of 385 newly manufactured railcars.\nNM = Not meaningful\nOur container and rail lease revenue from our owned fleets depends primarily upon a combination of: (1) the number of units in our owned fleet; (2) the utilization level of equipment in our owned fleet; and (3) the per diem rates charged under each equipment lease. The same factors in our managed fleet affect the amount of our management fee income. The number of CEUs in our container fleet, and the number of cars in our railcar fleet, varies over time as we purchase new equipment based on prevailing market conditions during the year and sell used equipment to parties in the secondary resale market.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\nCash Flow\n\nThe following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $155.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $25.9 million from $129.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to a $37.7 million increase in net income as adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items, partially offset by a decrease of $11.8 million in our net working capital adjustments. The increase in net income as adjusted for non-cash items was primarily due to a $66.0 million increase in net income, a $6.1 million increase in depreciation expense, and a $1.6 million reduction in contingent consideration, partially offset by an $18.0 million increase in gain on sale of used rental equipment, a $16.1 million decrease in deferred income taxes, and a $2.7 million decrease in bad debt expense as a result of the Hanjin bankruptcy. Net working capital used in operating activities of $13.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to a $5.0 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily caused by an increase in lease and logistics activity, a $2.2 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, primarily caused by a decrease in accrued tax expense as a result of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards, a $5.8 million decrease in due to container investors due to the decrease in our managed fleet, and a $1.3 million decrease in unearned revenue.\nWhile we sold 30% fewer used containers in 2017 compared to the prior year, there was an increase of 26% in the average sales price per unit, reflecting the recovery in new equipment prices during the year, resulting in a gain on sale of used rental equipment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements.\nIn May 2018, we purchased, and subsequently cancelled, 1.2 million shares of our common stock, from an affiliate of Andrew S. Ogawa in a privately-negotiated transaction. Mr. Ogawa is a member of our Board of Directors. The stock was purchased at a price of $22.81 per share, which represented a 2% discount to the closing price as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of purchase.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nLogistics Revenue\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nWe recognize revenue from operating leases of our owned equipment as earned over the term of the lease. Where minimum lease payments vary over the lease term, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We recognize revenue on a cash basis for certain railcar leases that are billed on an hourly or mileage basis through a third-party railcar manager. Early termination of the rental contracts subjects the lessee to a penalty, which is included in lease revenue upon such termination. Finance lease income is recognized using the effective interest method, which generates a constant rate of interest over the period of the lease. Included in lease revenue is revenue consisting primarily of fees charged to the lessee for handling, delivery, and repairs, which are recognized as earned.\n\ufeff\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLogistics transportation costs represent the expenses we incur for providing logistics services to our customers. Such costs include shipping, pick-up and delivery charges, primarily from railroads and drayage companies we contract with to fulfill the movement of our customers' freight.\nIn October 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to three million shares of our outstanding common stock. The number, price, structure and timing of the repurchases, if any, will be at our sole discretion and will be evaluated by us depending on market conditions, corporate needs and other factors. Stock repurchases may be made in the open market, block trades or privately negotiated transactions. This stock repurchase program replaced any available prior share repurchase authorization and may be discontinued at any time. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased 541,743 shares of our common stock under this repurchase plan, at a cost of approximately $12.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 2.5 million shares remained available for repurchase under our share repurchase plan.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\ufeff\n\nStorage, handling and other expenses\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\ufeff\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the terms of our revolving credit facilities, term loans and asset-based notes.\nLogistics\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\nThe increase in administrative expenses between 2017 and 2016 was primarily a result of higher employee-related costs, as well as an increase in allocated overhead costs due to the increase in size of the railcar fleet between the two periods.\n\ufeff\nThe increase in net interest expense between 2017 and 2016 was due primarily to an increase in our average loan principal balance between the two periods, as we increased our borrowings to finance our acquisition of additional rental equipment, as well as an increase in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt, caused by an increase in LIBOR, from approximately 2.7% at December 31, 2016 to 3.3% at December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 remained relatively consistent with other expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\t\t\t\nThe estimated useful lives and residual values for the majority of our container equipment purchased new from the factory are as follows:\n\ufeff\nThe increase in administrative expenses between 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to a $3.9 million increase in payroll related expenses, mainly bonus expense, and a $1.6 million decrease in credits related to adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration related to our acquisitions, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in bad debt expense resulting from the $2.5 million charge incurred in 2016 related to the bankruptcy of Hanjin.\n\t\t\nResults of Operations\nOne of our Japanese investor funds that is consolidated by us as a VIE entered into a term loan agreement with a bank. The VIE term loan matures in June 2019.\nThe equipment leasing market is highly competitive. As such, our relationships with our customers are important to ensure that they continue to select us as one of their providers of leased equipment. Our average container fleet utilization rate in CEUs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 99.2% compared to 97.4% and 92.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in our average fleet utilization from 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in demand for leased containers that continued from 2017. Our average railcar fleet utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 88.6% compared to 90.0% and 93.9% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If new railcars not yet leased are included in the total railcar fleet, railcar fleet utilization would be 81.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in the utilization of our railcar fleet has been primarily caused by decreased demand and competitive pressure in the rail market. Our utilization rate may increase or decrease depending on future global economic conditions and the additional supply of new equipment.\nThe increase in administrative expenses between 2018 and 2017 was primarily attributable to a $2.2 million decrease in credits related to adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to our previous acquisitions, a $0.6 million increase in rent expense, a $0.6 million increase in marketing expenses due to an increased effort to promote our brand and services, and a $0.3 million increase in payroll-related costs, largely due to increased headcount and increased stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation.\n\ufeff\nIn March 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,600,000 shares of our 8.50% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share and liquidation preference $25.00 per share (Series A Preferred Stock), resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $38.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. \ufeffIn April 2018, we sold an additional 170,900 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock upon the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Series A Preferred Stock, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $4.1 million, after deducting the underwriting discount. \ufeffThe net proceeds were used for repayment of debt and general corporate purposes.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $179.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased $24.6 million from $155.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to a $32.2 million increase in net income as adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items, partially offset by a decrease of $7.7 million in our net working capital adjustments. The increase in net income as adjusted for non-cash items was primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in net income, a $10.2 million increase in depreciation expense, a $17.4 million increase in deferred income taxes, a $2.2 million reduction in contingent consideration, and a $1.0 million increase in amortization of debt issuance costs, partially offset by a $6.4 million increase in gain on sale of used rental equipment. Net working capital used in operating activities of $21.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, was due to a $19.3 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily caused by an increase in lease and logistics activity and a $2.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets as a result of an increase in initial direct costs related to new railcar leases.\n\ufeff\nCommon Stock ATM Offering Program\ufeff\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nRail Leasing\n\ufeff\n\nThe increase in administrative expenses between 2017 and 2016 was primarily a result of $3.9 million of additional administrative expenses and a $0.6 million increase in amortization expense incurred by the logistics companies acquired in February and June 2016, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in administrative expenses for CAI Logistics, mainly attributable to a decrease in payroll related expenses due to a reduction in headcount.\nSeries A Preferred Stock ATM Offering Program\ufeff\n2018 Compared with 2017, and 2017 Compared with 2016\n\ufeff\nContainer rental equipment is recorded at original cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives and residual values of our container equipment are based on historical disposal experience and our expectations for future used container sale prices. Depreciation estimates are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether sustained changes have taken place in the useful lives of our equipment or assigned residual values, which would suggest that a change in depreciation estimates is warranted.\nWe depreciate our containers on a straight-line basis over a period ranging from 12 to 15 years to a fixed estimated residual value depending on the type of container (see Note 2(c) to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We regularly assess both the estimated useful life of our containers and their expected residual values, and, when warranted, adjust our depreciation estimate accordingly. Railcar equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful life of 43 years to its estimated residual value using the straight-line method. Depreciation expense for rental equipment will vary over time based upon the size of our owned rental equipment fleet and the purchase price of new equipment. If our rental equipment is impaired, the equipment is written-down to its fair value and the amount of the write-down is recorded in depreciation expense.\nOur revenue is comprised of container lease revenue, rail lease revenue, and logistics revenue.\nWe have entered into a series of collateralized financing obligations with Japanese investor funds that are consolidated by us as VIEs (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The obligations have maturity dates between March 2019 and December 2021.\nThe increase in income tax expense between 2018 and 2017 was mainly attributable to a $16.9 million tax benefit arising from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was recognized in 2017. Excluding this one-off benefit and other discrete items, the effective tax rate was 3.6% and related income tax expense was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 remained relatively consistent at 3.5%.\nThe decrease in income tax expense between 2017 and 2016 was mainly attributable to a $16.9 million tax benefit arising from the Tax Act that reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities, and a benefit of $1.8 million related to stock-based compensation excess tax benefits, partially offset by $1.9 million of tax expense related to prior year true-ups. Excluding these items, income tax expense was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 47%, compared to the prior year. Excluding the items noted above, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.6% compared to an effective tax rate of 39% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to an increase in the proportion of pretax income generated in lower tax jurisdictions by our container leasing business, and a corresponding decrease in the proportion of pretax income generated in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily by our railcar business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\ufeff\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $251.6 million to $663.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $411.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash usage was primarily attributable to a $310.0 million increase in the purchase of rental equipment, partially offset by a $39.8 million increase in proceeds from sale of used rental equipment and a $19.3 million increase in receipt of principal payments from direct financing leases.\n\t\t\t\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\ufeff\nWe utilize our term loans as an important funding source for the purchase of rental equipment. Our term loans amortize in monthly or quarterly installments and mature between October 2019 and October 2023.\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWe have three revolving credit facilities, which have a maximum borrowing capacity of $1,100.0 million, $550.0 million, and \u20ac25.0 million, respectively, and maturity dates of June 2023, October 2023, and September 2020, respectively. The entire amount of the facilities drawn at any time plus accrued interest and fees is callable on demand in the event of certain specified events of default.\nOur borrowings under the asset-backed facilities amortize in monthly installments and mature between October 2027 and September 2043. We are required to maintain a restricted cash account to cover payments of the obligations. As of December 31, 2018, the restricted cash account had a balance of $30.7 million.\nOur administrative expenses are primarily employee-related costs such as salary, bonus and commission expenses, employee benefits, rent, allowance for doubtful accounts and travel and entertainment costs, as well as expenses incurred for outside services such as legal, consulting and audit-related fees.\nIn addition to customary events of default, our revolving credit facilities and term loans contain restrictive covenants, including limitations on certain liens, indebtedness and investments. In addition, all of our debt facilities contain various restrictive financial and other covenants. The financial covenants in our debt facilities require us to maintain (1) a consolidated funded debt to consolidated tangible net worth ratio of no more than 3.75:1.00, and in the case of our asset-backed notes, of no more than 4.50:1:00; and (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.20:1.00, and in the case of our asset-backed notes, of at least 1.10:1.00. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.\n\nThe increase in storage, handling and other expenses between 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to a $1.2 million increase in storage and handling expenses as the size of the railcar fleet increased, while utilization decreased by 4%, between the two periods, as well as a $0.7 million increase in repair related costs and positioning fees, reflecting our efforts to put railcars on lease.\n(Gain) loss on sale of used rental equipment\nSenior Secured Notes\nFinancing Activities Cash Flows\nThe increase in logistics revenue between 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to an increase in freight rates in our intermodal and truck brokerage operations. Transportation costs increased at a slightly higher rate than revenue due primarily to increased volume in our lower margin intermodal business and resulted in a decrease in the gross margin percentage from 15.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $230.2 million to $411.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash usage was primarily attributable to a $250.9 million increase in the purchase of rental equipment, partially offset by a $15.6 million decrease in acquisition costs and a $4.4 million increase in receipt of principal payments from direct financing leases.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our outstanding indebtedness and the related maximum borrowing level was as follows (in thousands):\nRevenue Recognition\nOperating Expenses\nStorage, handling and other expenses are operating costs of our owned rental equipment fleet. Storage and handling expenses occur when lessees drop off equipment at depots at the end of a lease. Storage and handling expenses vary significantly by location. Other expenses include repair expenses, which are the result of normal wear and tear on the equipment, and repositioning expenses, which are incurred when we contract to move equipment from locations where our inventories exceed actual or expected demand to locations with higher demand. Storage, handling and other expenses are directly related to the number of units in our owned fleet and inversely related to our utilization rate for those units: as utilization increases, we typically have lower storage, handling and repositioning expenses.\n\t\t\t\nOur revenue comprises container lease revenue and rail lease revenue from our owned container and railcar fleets, management fee revenue for managing containers for third-party investors, and logistics revenue for the provision of logistics services.\nWe purchase new container equipment from manufacturers to lease to our customers. We also purchase used container equipment through sale-leaseback transactions with our customers, or equipment that was previously owned by one of our third party investors. Used equipment is typically purchased with an existing lease in place.\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe increase in depreciation expense between 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to a 16% increase in the average size of the railcar fleet. There was also an increase in the proportion of new railcars in the fleet leading to higher depreciation per railcar.\n\t\t\nOur railcars may undergo refurbishment and upgrade programs to, for example, extend their useful life, meet higher car classification grades, enter new product or service segments, increase the tonnage carried, or to achieve higher utilization. The costs for these programs are capitalized.\n\ufeff\nContainer Leasing\nPer Diem Rates. The per diem rate for a lease is set at the time we enter into a lease agreement. Our long-term per diem rates have historically been strongly influenced by new equipment pricing, interest rates, the balance of supply and demand for equipment at a particular time and location, our estimate of the residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease, the type and age of the equipment being leased, and, for container per diem rates, the purchase of equipment and efficiencies in container utilization by container shipping lines. The overall average per diem rates for equipment in our owned fleet and in the portfolios of equipment comprising our managed fleet do not change significantly in response to changes in new equipment prices because existing lease agreements can only be re-priced upon the expiration of the lease.\n\t\t\nThe decrease in storage, handling and other expenses between 2018 and 2017 was primarily attributable to a $3.9 million decrease in storage and handling costs and a $1.1 million decrease in positioning fees, both due to a decrease in the size of the off-lease fleet and a 2% increase in average utilization between the two periods, and a $1.8 million credit recorded in recovery costs as a result of insurance proceeds received in 2018 relating to the Hanjin bankruptcy, partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in container liability insurance premium.\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\nOur residual value estimates ($1,050 for a 20-ft. dry van, $1,300 for a 40-ft. dry van, and $1,400 for a 40-ft. high cube dry van) are slightly higher than the 3-year and 5-year average sale price for all equipment types and the 7-year average for 40-ft. high cube dry vans. While we experienced losses when selling certain of these assets during 2015 and 2016, there was a recovery in prices during 2017 that has continued into 2018, resulting in gains on sale of our equipment. Due to this cyclical nature in the container market, we do not adjust long-term residual value estimates based on short-term data points, such as current year sale results, the 3-year average and even the 5-year average shown above, as we do not believe they are indicative of a change in the long-term market value for these containers. As such, no change to the residual values of dry van containers was considered necessary during the year ended December 31, 2018. We regularly review this data and update our analysis, and will make revisions to residual value estimates as and when conditions warrant.\n\ufeff\nIn October 2017, we commenced an ATM offering program with respect to our common stock, which allows us to issue and sell up to 2.0 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we had issued 888,453 shares of common stock and had remaining capacity to issue up to approximately 1.1 million of additional shares of common stock under the ATM offering program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued 100,000 shares of common stock under the ATM offering program for net proceeds of $2.8 million. We paid commissions to the sales agent of $0.1 million in connection with the sales of common stock under this ATM offering program during the year ended December 31, 2018. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, we have remaining capacity to issue up to approximately 1.0 million of additional shares of common stock under this ATM offering program. \ufeff\n\t\t\nThe increase in logistics revenue between 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to an additional $15.8 million of revenue from the acquisitions of Challenger in February 2016 and Hybrid in June 2016, as well as new customers generating an additional $3.4 million of revenue. The increase in logistics transportation costs was mainly attributable to an additional $14.2 million of costs from the acquisitions of Challenger in February 2016 and Hybrid in June 2016, as well as an increase of $1.8 million as a result of new customer activity. The gross margin percentage of our logistics business for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 15.4%, consistent with the prior year.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nWhile we sold 28% fewer CEUs of used containers in 2018 compared to the prior year, there was an increase of 54% in the average sales price per unit, which reflected the recovery in new equipment prices in the last twelve months as well as a limited supply of used equipment on the market, and resulted in an increase in gain on sale of used rental equipment.\nWe use the revolving credit facilities primarily to fund the purchase of rental equipment. As of December 31, 2018, in addition to a rental equipment payable of $74.1 million, we had commitments to purchase $9.4 million of containers and $64.4 million of railcars in the twelve months ending December 31, 2019.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\nThe increase in administrative expenses between 2018 and 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase of $2.1 million in payroll-related costs due to a 36% increase in headcount.\nThe decrease in storage, handling and other expenses between 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to a $13.7 million decrease in storage costs as the size of the off-lease fleet decreased compared to the prior year, a $2.7 million decrease in repair and maintenance costs, and $1.5 million of insurance proceeds recorded related to repair costs associated with the previously reported Hanjin bankruptcy, partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in container liability insurance premium resulting from the Hanjin insurance claim.\n\ufeff\nITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\t\t\n\t\t\nUtilization. We measure container utilization on the basis of the average number of CEUs on lease expressed as a percentage of our total container fleet available for lease. We measure railcar utilization on the basis of the average number of railcars on lease expressed as a percentage of our total railcar fleet available for lease. In both cases, we calculate the total fleet available for lease by excluding new units that have been manufactured for us but either remain at the manufacturer or have not yet entered their first lease, and off-hire units that are likely to be sold. Our utilization is primarily driven by the overall level of equipment demand, the location of our available equipment and the quality of our relationships with equipment lessees. The location of available equipment is critical because equipment available in high-demand locations is more readily leased and is typically leased on more favorable terms than equipment available in low-demand locations.\n\t\t\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWe are one of the world's leading transportation finance and logistics companies. We purchase equipment, primarily intermodal shipping containers and railcars, which we lease to our customers. We also manage equipment for third-party investors. In operating our fleet, we lease, re-lease and dispose of equipment and contract for the repair, repositioning and storage of equipment. We also provide domestic and international logistics services. As of December 31, 2018, our container fleet comprised 1,568,707 CEUs, 96% of which represented our owned fleet and 4% of which represented our managed fleet. In addition, we also own 7,279 railcars, which we lease within North America.\nOur operating expenses include transportation costs, depreciation of rental equipment, storage, handling and other expenses applicable to our owned equipment, and administrative expenses.\nOther specialized equipment is depreciated to its estimated residual value, which ranges from $1,000 to $3,500, over its estimated useful life of between 12.5 years and 15 years.\n\t\t\nRail\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nContainer\n\t\t\t\nOverview\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\t\t\t\nIn May 2018, we commenced an ATM offering program with respect to our Series A Preferred Stock, which allows us to issue and sell up to 2.2 million shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued 428,710 shares of Series A Preferred Stock under the ATM offering program for net proceeds of $10.5 million. We paid commissions to the sales agent of $0.2 million in connection with the sales of Series A Preferred Stock under this ATM offering program during the year ended December 31, 2018. The net proceeds were used for debt repayment and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, we have remaining capacity to issue up to approximately 1.8 million of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock under this ATM program. \ufeff\n\t\t\t\nOther expenses\nDepreciation of rental equipment\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $512.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $261.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of higher net borrowings being required to finance the acquisition of rental equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash inflow from borrowings was $458.2 million compared to $226.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting an increase in investment in rental equipment during 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was also attributable to an increase of $75.4 million in proceeds received from issuances of common stock under our At-the-Market (ATM) offering program and issuances of Preferred Stock in underwritten offerings and Series A Preferred Stock under our Series A Preferred Stock ATM offering program, partially offset by a $40.9 million increase in the repurchase of our common stock.\nLogistics Revenue. We generate logistics revenue by arranging for the movement of our customers' freight through our network of non-affiliated transportation carriers and equipment providers. Revenue is comprised of the gross price charged to our customers.\nOther expense\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our Series B Preferred Stock.\nAsset-Backed Notes\nRevenue\n\t\t\t\nThe increase in depreciation expense between 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase of $4.4 million resulting from a decrease in the residual value estimates for 40-foot high cube dry van containers implemented in 2016, a $1.3 million write-off of rental equipment on lease to a bankrupt customer and a 7% increase in the average size of our owned fleet between the two periods, partially offset by a decrease due to a one-time impairment charge of $2.0 million, related to the Hanjin bankruptcy, recorded in 2016.\nThe increase in net interest expense between 2018 and 2017 was due primarily to an increase in our average loan principal balance between the two periods, as we continue to increase our borrowings to finance our acquisition of additional rental equipment, as well as an increase in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt, caused by an increase in LIBOR, from approximately 3.3% at December 31, 2017 to 3.9% at December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1,358.3 million of total debt outstanding on facilities with fixed interest rates. These fixed rate facilities are scheduled to mature between 2019 and 2043, and had a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% as of December 31, 2018.\nKey Metrics\nOur logistics business derives its revenue from three principal sources: (1) truck brokerage services, (2) intermodal transportation services, and (3) international ocean freight and freight forwarding services. For truck brokerage services, which typically involve a short transit time, revenue is recognized when delivery has been completed due to the lack of reliable information to reasonably measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. For intermodal transportation services, which can take a longer time to complete, revenue is recognized over time by measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, utilizing input methods. For any such services not completed at the end of a reporting period, we use a percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period. We provide international freight forwarding services as an indirect carrier, sometimes referred to as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier. Due to the lack of reliable information to reasonably measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, revenue from these shipments is recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin, which is when the customer is billed and we have no further obligation to the customer.\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our Series A Preferred Stock. \ufeff\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which requires lessors to classify leases as a sales-type, direct financing, or operating lease. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, and ASU 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors. A lease is a sales-type lease if any of five criteria are met, each of which indicate that the lease, in effect, transfers control of the underlying asset to the lessee. If none of those five criteria are met, but two additional criteria are both met, indicating that the lessor has transferred substantially all of the risks and benefits of the underlying asset to the lessee and a third-party, the lease is a direct financing lease. All leases that are not sales-type or direct financing leases are operating leases. The new standard also established a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize an ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than twelve months.\nWe used the proceeds from the senior secured notes primarily to fund the purchase of rental equipment. The notes amortize in semi-annual installments and mature in September 2022.\nOn at least an annual basis, we evaluate our rental equipment fleet to determine whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of all, or part, of our fleet may not be recoverable. Events which would trigger an impairment review include, among others, a significant decrease in the long-term average market value of rental equipment, a significant decrease in the utilization rate of rental equipment resulting in an inability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods, or a change in market conditions resulting in a significant decrease in lease rates.\nAlso included in lease revenue is revenue from management fees earned under equipment management agreements. Management fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the monthly net operating income for an investor's portfolio and recognized as revenue in the month of service.\nRail lease revenue\nLogistics revenue and gross margin\n\t\t\nNormal repairs and maintenance associated with our railcar assets are expensed as incurred.\nFor used container equipment acquired through sale-leaseback transactions, we often adjust our estimates for remaining useful life and residual values based on current conditions in the sale market for older containers and our expectations for how long the equipment will remain on-hire to the current lessee.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOther Debt Obligations\n\ufeff\nRail lease revenue increased between 2017 and 2016, primarily as a result of a $1.0 million settlement with a customer for damaged railcars recognized in 2017, and a 2% increase in the average size of our on-lease railcar fleet. The average lease revenue per railcar also increased as new railcars, which command higher per diem rental rates than used railcars, formed a larger percentage of the fleet.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, change in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditure, or capital resources that are material to investors. An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which we would have: (1) retained a contingent interest in transferred assets; (2) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity; (3) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us; or (4) made guarantees.\nIn August 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,700,000 shares of our 8.50% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share and liquidation preference $25.00 per share (Series B Preferred Stock), resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $41.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. We sold an additional 255,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock upon the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Series B Preferred Stock, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $6.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount. \ufeffThe net proceeds were used for repayment of debt and general corporate purposes.\nStock Repurchase Plan\nWe have typically funded a significant portion of the purchase price for new equipment through borrowings under our credit facilities. However, from time to time we have funded new equipment acquisitions through the use of working capital.", "item_7_text": "\t\t\nRail Leasing\nWe have completed our full assessment of adopting the new standard and have determined that adoption will not have a material effect on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nOur term loans, senior secured notes, asset-backed notes, collateralized financing obligations and term loans held by VIEs are secured by specific pools of rental equipment and other assets owned by the Company, the underlying leases thereon and the Company's interest in any money received under such contracts.\nThe increase in administrative expenses between 2018 and 2017 was primarily a result of higher employee-related costs, largely due to increased incentive compensation.\nStorage, handling and other expenses remained relatively consistent between 2018 and 2017.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\nThe increase in depreciation expense between 2018 and 2017 was primarily attributable to a 16% increase in the average size of the railcar fleet, excluding new railcars not yet on lease, during the last twelve months and an impairment charge of $0.6 million related to off-lease railcars designated for scrap recognized in 2018. There was also an increase in the proportion of new railcars in the fleet leading to higher depreciation per railcar.\nThe increase in container lease revenue between 2018 and 2017 was a result of a $54.2 million increase in rental revenue, primarily due to a 25% increase in the average number of CEUs of on-lease owned containers, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in rental revenue resulting from a 1% decrease in average owned container per diem rental rates, and $2.2 million of container lease revenue from insurance proceeds recognized in 2017 that was not recurring in 2018. The reduction in average container per diem rental rates has been caused primarily by competitive market pressure.\n\ufeff\nSeries B Preferred Stock Underwritten Offering\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either (1) its effective date or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. If an entity chooses the second option, the transitions requirements for existing leases also apply to leases entered into between the date of initial application and the effective date. The entity must also recast its comparative period financial statements and provide the disclosures required by the new standard for the comparative periods. We expect to adopt the new standard on January 1, 2019 and use the effective date as our date of initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $45.3 million, including $25.2 million of cash held by VIEs. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash in-flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity and debt offerings. Our cash in-flows are used to finance capital expenditures and meet debt service requirements.\n\nAdministrative expenses\nContainer Lease Revenue. We generate container lease revenue by leasing our owned containers primarily to container shipping lines. Approximately 96% of our container lease revenue is derived from the rental of containers. Container lease revenue is comprised of monthly lease payments due under the lease agreements together with payments for other charges set forth in the leases, such as handling fees, drop-off charges and repair charges. Approximately 22% of our owned container fleet is subject to finance leases. Under a finance lease, the lessee's payments consist of principal and interest components. The interest component is included within container lease revenue. Lessees under our finance leases have the substantive risks and rewards of equipment ownership and typically have the option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term for a nominal amount.\n\ufeff\nContainer lease revenue also includes management fee revenue generated by our management services, which include the leasing, re-leasing, repair, repositioning, storage and disposition of equipment. We provide these management services pursuant to management agreements with third-party investors. Under these agreements, which have multiple year terms, we earn fees for the management of the equipment and a commission, or a managed units' sales fee, upon disposition of equipment under management.\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments by due date as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n(1)Our estimate of interest expense commitment includes $112.6 million relating to our revolving credit facilities, $40.4 million relating to our term loans, $9.4 million relating to our senior secured notes, $176.5 million relating to our asset-backed notes, $2.2 million relating to our collateralized financing obligations, and less than $0.1 million related to our term loans held by VIEs. The calculation of interest commitment related to our debt assumes the following weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2018: revolving credit facilities, 4.1%; term loans, 4.1%; senior secured notes, 4.9%; asset-backed notes, 4.0%; collateralized financing obligations, 1.2%; and term loans held by VIEs, 3.3%. These calculations assume that interest rates will remain at the same level over the next five years. We expect that interest rates will vary over time based upon fluctuations in the underlying indexes upon which these interest rates are based.\n\ufeff\nOur asset-backed notes were issued by two of our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, which were established to facilitate asset-backed note financings. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the asset-backed notes primarily to repay part of our borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility and to reduce the balance on one of our term loans.\n\t\t\t\nWe provide a range of services to our customers incorporating rental, sale and management of equipment, and the provision of logistics services. Revenue for all forms of service is recognized when earned following the guidelines under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue Recognition and FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases. Revenue is reported net of any related sales tax.\n\ufeff\nInvesting Activities Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $251.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $205.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of higher net borrowings being required to finance the acquisition of rental equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash inflow from borrowings was $226.5 million compared to $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting an increase in investment in rental equipment during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was also attributable to an increase of $28.0 million in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our ATM offering program and a decrease of $9.2 million used to repurchase our common stock, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in debt issuance costs, primarily related to the asset-backed notes issued in 2017.\nTerm Loans\n\t\t\nWhen testing for impairment, equipment is generally grouped by equipment type, and is tested separately from other groups of assets and liabilities. Potential impairment exists when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group, comprised of lease proceeds and residual values, less related operating expenses, are less than the carrying value of that asset group. If potential impairment exists, the equipment is written down to its fair value. In determining the fair value of an asset group, we consider market trends, published value for similar assets, recent transactions of similar assets and in certain cases, quotes from third party appraisers. No impairment charges were recorded in 2018, 2017 and 2016 as a result of our annual review.\nRail Leasing\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. We have identified the policies and estimates below as among those critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies and estimates are considered critical due to the existence of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made, the likelihood of changes in estimates from period to period and the potential impact that these estimates can have on our financial statements. The following accounting policies and estimates include inherent risks and uncertainties related to judgments and assumptions made by us. Our estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\t\t\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe cease recognition of lease revenue if and when a lessee defaults in making timely lease payments or we otherwise determine that future lease payments are not likely to be collected from the lessee. Our determination of the collectability of future lease payments is made by management on the basis of available information, including the current creditworthiness of lessees, historical collection results and review of specific past due receivables. If we experience unexpected payment defaults from our lessees, we will cease accruing rental revenue as earned and will recognize revenue as cash is received.\n\t\t\nWe report logistics revenue on a gross basis as we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified service desired by the customer and have discretion in establishing the price for the specified service.\nRail Lease Revenue. We generate rail lease revenue by leasing our railcars primarily for the transport of industrial goods, materials and other products on railroad tracks throughout North America. Rail lease revenue is comprised of monthly lease payments due under the lease agreements. Lease revenue may be based on a fixed monthly rate or may be recognized on an hourly or mileage basis. None of our railcars are subject to finance leases.\nSeries A Preferred Stock Underwritten Offering\ufeff\nRail Leasing\nContainer Leasing\nThe increase in depreciation expense between 2018 and 2017 was primarily attributable to a 12% increase in the average size of our owned fleet between the two periods, partially offset by a $1.3 million one-time write-off of rental equipment on lease to a bankrupt customer, which was recognized in 2017, and an increase in assets on direct finance leases.\n\nNet interest expense\n\nEquity Transactions\nThe increase in container lease revenue between 2017 and 2016 was a result of a $35.2 million increase in rental revenue, primarily due to a 19% increase in the average number of CEUs of on-lease owned containers, partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in rental revenue resulting from a 3% decrease in average owned container per diem rental rates, and a decrease of $1.4 million reflecting lost revenue related to the bankruptcy of Hanjin in 2016, net of $2.2 million of insurance proceeds for lost lease rental revenue, recognized in 2017. The reduction in average container per diem rental rates has been primarily caused by competitive market pressure.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1,081.4 million in availability under our revolving credit facilities (net of $0.1 million in letters of credit), subject to our ability to meet the collateral requirements under the agreements governing the facilities. Based on the borrowing base and collateral requirements as of December 31, 2018, the borrowing availability under our revolving credit facilities was $111.2 million, assuming no additional contributions of assets.\n\t\t\nOther expense, being a loss on foreign exchange, of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 remained relatively consistent with other expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nThe largest segment of our non-dry van container fleet consists of 20-ft. refrigerated containers and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers. We regularly review the residual value estimates associated with our refrigerated containers. Given the specific nature of these assets and the lower volumes of containers that are sold each year in the secondary market, not always at the end of the container's life, there is more variability in asset pricing. Similar to our dry van containers, we evaluate the relationship between sales prices and residual values over a long-term horizon. We excluded 7-year and 13-year historical averages from our analysis as we do not have a long enough history of sales for refrigerated containers. The current residual values for 20-ft. refrigerated and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers are set at $2,750 and $3,500, respectively. Based on the data trends, we believe that the residual value estimates for our refrigerated containers are appropriate and do not warrant revision.\nRailcar equipment is recorded at original cost and depreciated over its estimated useful life of 43 years to its estimated residual value of $8,700 using the straight-line method. We determine the useful life based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenue. Residual value is based on the average estimated scrap value of our railcars. We periodically review the appropriateness of our estimates of useful life and residual value based on changes in economic circumstances and other factors.\nContainer Leasing\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We expect to elect (1) the package of practical expedients\u201d, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs, (2) the short-term lease recognition exemption for our office space leases of twelve months or less, which means we will not recognize an ROU asset or lease liability for these leases, and (3) the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases. We do not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to us.\n\ufeff\nContainer Leasing\nUnder certain conditions, as defined in our credit agreements with our banks and/or note holders, we are subject to certain cross default provisions that may result in an acceleration of principal repayment under these credit facilities if an uncured default condition were to exist. Our asset-backed notes are not subject to any such cross-default provisions.\nOur operating expenses include the gain or loss on sale of used rental equipment. This gain or loss is typically the result of our sale of used equipment in the secondary resale market and is the difference between: (1) the cash we receive for these units, less selling expenses; and (2) the net book value of the units.\n\t\t\t\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\ufeff\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $821.0 million of total debt outstanding on facilities with interest rates based on floating rate indices (primarily LIBOR). These floating rate facilities are schedule to mature between 2019 and 2023, and had a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% as of December 31, 2018.\nRental Equipment\n\ufeff\nNote 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a reconciliation between the tax expense calculated at the statutory U.S. income tax rate and the actual tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\nContainer and Rail Lease Revenue\nRail lease revenue increased between 2018 and 2017, primarily as a result of a 14% increase in the average size of our on-lease railcar fleet and a 2% increase in rental rates, partially offset by a $1.0 million settlement with a customer for damaged railcars recognized in 2017.\nContainer lease revenue\n\t\t\t\nIn considering changes to residual values for the three major dry van categories and two refrigerated container categories, we reviewed 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, and 13-year average disposition pricing trends. As with all estimates, particularly related to long-lived assets, current market performance may not necessarily be indicative of long-term residual values, so we do not adjust residual values to point-in-time prices. Rather, we consider the mix of data shown in the following tables and use the average over time to either confirm residual value estimates or support revisions to those estimates.\nThe sale-related unit proceeds by dry van and refrigerated container category that we considered as of October 31, 2018, when we performed our annual residual value analysis, are shown below:\nOperating Activities Cash Flows\n\t\t\t\nWe recorded a gain of $1.8 million on the sale of used rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a gain of less than $0.1 million in 2017, and a loss of less than $0.1 million in 2016, respectively. The $1.8 million gain in 2018 resulted from the sale of 385 newly manufactured railcars.\nNM = Not meaningful\nOur container and rail lease revenue from our owned fleets depends primarily upon a combination of: (1) the number of units in our owned fleet; (2) the utilization level of equipment in our owned fleet; and (3) the per diem rates charged under each equipment lease. The same factors in our managed fleet affect the amount of our management fee income. The number of CEUs in our container fleet, and the number of cars in our railcar fleet, varies over time as we purchase new equipment based on prevailing market conditions during the year and sell used equipment to parties in the secondary resale market.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\nCash Flow\n\nThe following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $155.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $25.9 million from $129.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to a $37.7 million increase in net income as adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items, partially offset by a decrease of $11.8 million in our net working capital adjustments. The increase in net income as adjusted for non-cash items was primarily due to a $66.0 million increase in net income, a $6.1 million increase in depreciation expense, and a $1.6 million reduction in contingent consideration, partially offset by an $18.0 million increase in gain on sale of used rental equipment, a $16.1 million decrease in deferred income taxes, and a $2.7 million decrease in bad debt expense as a result of the Hanjin bankruptcy. Net working capital used in operating activities of $13.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to a $5.0 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily caused by an increase in lease and logistics activity, a $2.2 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, primarily caused by a decrease in accrued tax expense as a result of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards, a $5.8 million decrease in due to container investors due to the decrease in our managed fleet, and a $1.3 million decrease in unearned revenue.\nWhile we sold 30% fewer used containers in 2017 compared to the prior year, there was an increase of 26% in the average sales price per unit, reflecting the recovery in new equipment prices during the year, resulting in a gain on sale of used rental equipment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements.\nIn May 2018, we purchased, and subsequently cancelled, 1.2 million shares of our common stock, from an affiliate of Andrew S. Ogawa in a privately-negotiated transaction. Mr. Ogawa is a member of our Board of Directors. The stock was purchased at a price of $22.81 per share, which represented a 2% discount to the closing price as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of purchase.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nLogistics Revenue\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nWe recognize revenue from operating leases of our owned equipment as earned over the term of the lease. Where minimum lease payments vary over the lease term, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We recognize revenue on a cash basis for certain railcar leases that are billed on an hourly or mileage basis through a third-party railcar manager. Early termination of the rental contracts subjects the lessee to a penalty, which is included in lease revenue upon such termination. Finance lease income is recognized using the effective interest method, which generates a constant rate of interest over the period of the lease. Included in lease revenue is revenue consisting primarily of fees charged to the lessee for handling, delivery, and repairs, which are recognized as earned.\n\ufeff\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLogistics transportation costs represent the expenses we incur for providing logistics services to our customers. Such costs include shipping, pick-up and delivery charges, primarily from railroads and drayage companies we contract with to fulfill the movement of our customers' freight.\nIn October 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to three million shares of our outstanding common stock. The number, price, structure and timing of the repurchases, if any, will be at our sole discretion and will be evaluated by us depending on market conditions, corporate needs and other factors. Stock repurchases may be made in the open market, block trades or privately negotiated transactions. This stock repurchase program replaced any available prior share repurchase authorization and may be discontinued at any time. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased 541,743 shares of our common stock under this repurchase plan, at a cost of approximately $12.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 2.5 million shares remained available for repurchase under our share repurchase plan.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\ufeff\n\nStorage, handling and other expenses\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\ufeff\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the terms of our revolving credit facilities, term loans and asset-based notes.\nLogistics\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\nThe increase in administrative expenses between 2017 and 2016 was primarily a result of higher employee-related costs, as well as an increase in allocated overhead costs due to the increase in size of the railcar fleet between the two periods.\n\ufeff\nThe increase in net interest expense between 2017 and 2016 was due primarily to an increase in our average loan principal balance between the two periods, as we increased our borrowings to finance our acquisition of additional rental equipment, as well as an increase in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt, caused by an increase in LIBOR, from approximately 2.7% at December 31, 2016 to 3.3% at December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 remained relatively consistent with other expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\t\t\t\nThe estimated useful lives and residual values for the majority of our container equipment purchased new from the factory are as follows:\n\ufeff\nThe increase in administrative expenses between 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to a $3.9 million increase in payroll related expenses, mainly bonus expense, and a $1.6 million decrease in credits related to adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration related to our acquisitions, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in bad debt expense resulting from the $2.5 million charge incurred in 2016 related to the bankruptcy of Hanjin.\n\t\t\nResults of Operations\nOne of our Japanese investor funds that is consolidated by us as a VIE entered into a term loan agreement with a bank. The VIE term loan matures in June 2019.\nThe equipment leasing market is highly competitive. As such, our relationships with our customers are important to ensure that they continue to select us as one of their providers of leased equipment. Our average container fleet utilization rate in CEUs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 99.2% compared to 97.4% and 92.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in our average fleet utilization from 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in demand for leased containers that continued from 2017. Our average railcar fleet utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 88.6% compared to 90.0% and 93.9% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If new railcars not yet leased are included in the total railcar fleet, railcar fleet utilization would be 81.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in the utilization of our railcar fleet has been primarily caused by decreased demand and competitive pressure in the rail market. Our utilization rate may increase or decrease depending on future global economic conditions and the additional supply of new equipment.\nThe increase in administrative expenses between 2018 and 2017 was primarily attributable to a $2.2 million decrease in credits related to adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to our previous acquisitions, a $0.6 million increase in rent expense, a $0.6 million increase in marketing expenses due to an increased effort to promote our brand and services, and a $0.3 million increase in payroll-related costs, largely due to increased headcount and increased stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation.\n\ufeff\nIn March 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,600,000 shares of our 8.50% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share and liquidation preference $25.00 per share (Series A Preferred Stock), resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $38.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. \ufeffIn April 2018, we sold an additional 170,900 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock upon the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Series A Preferred Stock, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $4.1 million, after deducting the underwriting discount. \ufeffThe net proceeds were used for repayment of debt and general corporate purposes.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $179.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased $24.6 million from $155.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to a $32.2 million increase in net income as adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items, partially offset by a decrease of $7.7 million in our net working capital adjustments. The increase in net income as adjusted for non-cash items was primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in net income, a $10.2 million increase in depreciation expense, a $17.4 million increase in deferred income taxes, a $2.2 million reduction in contingent consideration, and a $1.0 million increase in amortization of debt issuance costs, partially offset by a $6.4 million increase in gain on sale of used rental equipment. Net working capital used in operating activities of $21.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, was due to a $19.3 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily caused by an increase in lease and logistics activity and a $2.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets as a result of an increase in initial direct costs related to new railcar leases.\n\ufeff\nCommon Stock ATM Offering Program\ufeff\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nRail Leasing\n\ufeff\n\nThe increase in administrative expenses between 2017 and 2016 was primarily a result of $3.9 million of additional administrative expenses and a $0.6 million increase in amortization expense incurred by the logistics companies acquired in February and June 2016, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in administrative expenses for CAI Logistics, mainly attributable to a decrease in payroll related expenses due to a reduction in headcount.\nSeries A Preferred Stock ATM Offering Program\ufeff\n2018 Compared with 2017, and 2017 Compared with 2016\n\ufeff\nContainer rental equipment is recorded at original cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives and residual values of our container equipment are based on historical disposal experience and our expectations for future used container sale prices. Depreciation estimates are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether sustained changes have taken place in the useful lives of our equipment or assigned residual values, which would suggest that a change in depreciation estimates is warranted.\nWe depreciate our containers on a straight-line basis over a period ranging from 12 to 15 years to a fixed estimated residual value depending on the type of container (see Note 2(c) to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We regularly assess both the estimated useful life of our containers and their expected residual values, and, when warranted, adjust our depreciation estimate accordingly. Railcar equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful life of 43 years to its estimated residual value using the straight-line method. Depreciation expense for rental equipment will vary over time based upon the size of our owned rental equipment fleet and the purchase price of new equipment. If our rental equipment is impaired, the equipment is written-down to its fair value and the amount of the write-down is recorded in depreciation expense.\nOur revenue is comprised of container lease revenue, rail lease revenue, and logistics revenue.\nWe have entered into a series of collateralized financing obligations with Japanese investor funds that are consolidated by us as VIEs (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The obligations have maturity dates between March 2019 and December 2021.\nThe increase in income tax expense between 2018 and 2017 was mainly attributable to a $16.9 million tax benefit arising from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was recognized in 2017. Excluding this one-off benefit and other discrete items, the effective tax rate was 3.6% and related income tax expense was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 remained relatively consistent at 3.5%.\nThe decrease in income tax expense between 2017 and 2016 was mainly attributable to a $16.9 million tax benefit arising from the Tax Act that reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities, and a benefit of $1.8 million related to stock-based compensation excess tax benefits, partially offset by $1.9 million of tax expense related to prior year true-ups. Excluding these items, income tax expense was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 47%, compared to the prior year. Excluding the items noted above, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.6% compared to an effective tax rate of 39% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to an increase in the proportion of pretax income generated in lower tax jurisdictions by our container leasing business, and a corresponding decrease in the proportion of pretax income generated in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily by our railcar business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\ufeff\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $251.6 million to $663.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $411.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash usage was primarily attributable to a $310.0 million increase in the purchase of rental equipment, partially offset by a $39.8 million increase in proceeds from sale of used rental equipment and a $19.3 million increase in receipt of principal payments from direct financing leases.\n\t\t\t\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\ufeff\nWe utilize our term loans as an important funding source for the purchase of rental equipment. Our term loans amortize in monthly or quarterly installments and mature between October 2019 and October 2023.\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWe have three revolving credit facilities, which have a maximum borrowing capacity of $1,100.0 million, $550.0 million, and \u20ac25.0 million, respectively, and maturity dates of June 2023, October 2023, and September 2020, respectively. The entire amount of the facilities drawn at any time plus accrued interest and fees is callable on demand in the event of certain specified events of default.\nOur borrowings under the asset-backed facilities amortize in monthly installments and mature between October 2027 and September 2043. We are required to maintain a restricted cash account to cover payments of the obligations. As of December 31, 2018, the restricted cash account had a balance of $30.7 million.\nOur administrative expenses are primarily employee-related costs such as salary, bonus and commission expenses, employee benefits, rent, allowance for doubtful accounts and travel and entertainment costs, as well as expenses incurred for outside services such as legal, consulting and audit-related fees.\nIn addition to customary events of default, our revolving credit facilities and term loans contain restrictive covenants, including limitations on certain liens, indebtedness and investments. In addition, all of our debt facilities contain various restrictive financial and other covenants. The financial covenants in our debt facilities require us to maintain (1) a consolidated funded debt to consolidated tangible net worth ratio of no more than 3.75:1.00, and in the case of our asset-backed notes, of no more than 4.50:1:00; and (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.20:1.00, and in the case of our asset-backed notes, of at least 1.10:1.00. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.\n\nThe increase in storage, handling and other expenses between 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to a $1.2 million increase in storage and handling expenses as the size of the railcar fleet increased, while utilization decreased by 4%, between the two periods, as well as a $0.7 million increase in repair related costs and positioning fees, reflecting our efforts to put railcars on lease.\n(Gain) loss on sale of used rental equipment\nSenior Secured Notes\nFinancing Activities Cash Flows\nThe increase in logistics revenue between 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to an increase in freight rates in our intermodal and truck brokerage operations. Transportation costs increased at a slightly higher rate than revenue due primarily to increased volume in our lower margin intermodal business and resulted in a decrease in the gross margin percentage from 15.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $230.2 million to $411.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash usage was primarily attributable to a $250.9 million increase in the purchase of rental equipment, partially offset by a $15.6 million decrease in acquisition costs and a $4.4 million increase in receipt of principal payments from direct financing leases.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our outstanding indebtedness and the related maximum borrowing level was as follows (in thousands):\nRevenue Recognition\nOperating Expenses\nStorage, handling and other expenses are operating costs of our owned rental equipment fleet. Storage and handling expenses occur when lessees drop off equipment at depots at the end of a lease. Storage and handling expenses vary significantly by location. Other expenses include repair expenses, which are the result of normal wear and tear on the equipment, and repositioning expenses, which are incurred when we contract to move equipment from locations where our inventories exceed actual or expected demand to locations with higher demand. Storage, handling and other expenses are directly related to the number of units in our owned fleet and inversely related to our utilization rate for those units: as utilization increases, we typically have lower storage, handling and repositioning expenses.\n\t\t\t\nOur revenue comprises container lease revenue and rail lease revenue from our owned container and railcar fleets, management fee revenue for managing containers for third-party investors, and logistics revenue for the provision of logistics services.\nWe purchase new container equipment from manufacturers to lease to our customers. We also purchase used container equipment through sale-leaseback transactions with our customers, or equipment that was previously owned by one of our third party investors. Used equipment is typically purchased with an existing lease in place.\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe increase in depreciation expense between 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to a 16% increase in the average size of the railcar fleet. There was also an increase in the proportion of new railcars in the fleet leading to higher depreciation per railcar.\n\t\t\nOur railcars may undergo refurbishment and upgrade programs to, for example, extend their useful life, meet higher car classification grades, enter new product or service segments, increase the tonnage carried, or to achieve higher utilization. The costs for these programs are capitalized.\n\ufeff\nContainer Leasing\nPer Diem Rates. The per diem rate for a lease is set at the time we enter into a lease agreement. Our long-term per diem rates have historically been strongly influenced by new equipment pricing, interest rates, the balance of supply and demand for equipment at a particular time and location, our estimate of the residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease, the type and age of the equipment being leased, and, for container per diem rates, the purchase of equipment and efficiencies in container utilization by container shipping lines. The overall average per diem rates for equipment in our owned fleet and in the portfolios of equipment comprising our managed fleet do not change significantly in response to changes in new equipment prices because existing lease agreements can only be re-priced upon the expiration of the lease.\n\t\t\nThe decrease in storage, handling and other expenses between 2018 and 2017 was primarily attributable to a $3.9 million decrease in storage and handling costs and a $1.1 million decrease in positioning fees, both due to a decrease in the size of the off-lease fleet and a 2% increase in average utilization between the two periods, and a $1.8 million credit recorded in recovery costs as a result of insurance proceeds received in 2018 relating to the Hanjin bankruptcy, partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in container liability insurance premium.\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\nOur residual value estimates ($1,050 for a 20-ft. dry van, $1,300 for a 40-ft. dry van, and $1,400 for a 40-ft. high cube dry van) are slightly higher than the 3-year and 5-year average sale price for all equipment types and the 7-year average for 40-ft. high cube dry vans. While we experienced losses when selling certain of these assets during 2015 and 2016, there was a recovery in prices during 2017 that has continued into 2018, resulting in gains on sale of our equipment. Due to this cyclical nature in the container market, we do not adjust long-term residual value estimates based on short-term data points, such as current year sale results, the 3-year average and even the 5-year average shown above, as we do not believe they are indicative of a change in the long-term market value for these containers. As such, no change to the residual values of dry van containers was considered necessary during the year ended December 31, 2018. We regularly review this data and update our analysis, and will make revisions to residual value estimates as and when conditions warrant.\n\ufeff\nIn October 2017, we commenced an ATM offering program with respect to our common stock, which allows us to issue and sell up to 2.0 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we had issued 888,453 shares of common stock and had remaining capacity to issue up to approximately 1.1 million of additional shares of common stock under the ATM offering program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued 100,000 shares of common stock under the ATM offering program for net proceeds of $2.8 million. We paid commissions to the sales agent of $0.1 million in connection with the sales of common stock under this ATM offering program during the year ended December 31, 2018. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, we have remaining capacity to issue up to approximately 1.0 million of additional shares of common stock under this ATM offering program. \ufeff\n\t\t\nThe increase in logistics revenue between 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to an additional $15.8 million of revenue from the acquisitions of Challenger in February 2016 and Hybrid in June 2016, as well as new customers generating an additional $3.4 million of revenue. The increase in logistics transportation costs was mainly attributable to an additional $14.2 million of costs from the acquisitions of Challenger in February 2016 and Hybrid in June 2016, as well as an increase of $1.8 million as a result of new customer activity. The gross margin percentage of our logistics business for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 15.4%, consistent with the prior year.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nWhile we sold 28% fewer CEUs of used containers in 2018 compared to the prior year, there was an increase of 54% in the average sales price per unit, which reflected the recovery in new equipment prices in the last twelve months as well as a limited supply of used equipment on the market, and resulted in an increase in gain on sale of used rental equipment.\nWe use the revolving credit facilities primarily to fund the purchase of rental equipment. As of December 31, 2018, in addition to a rental equipment payable of $74.1 million, we had commitments to purchase $9.4 million of containers and $64.4 million of railcars in the twelve months ending December 31, 2019.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\nThe increase in administrative expenses between 2018 and 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase of $2.1 million in payroll-related costs due to a 36% increase in headcount.\nThe decrease in storage, handling and other expenses between 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to a $13.7 million decrease in storage costs as the size of the off-lease fleet decreased compared to the prior year, a $2.7 million decrease in repair and maintenance costs, and $1.5 million of insurance proceeds recorded related to repair costs associated with the previously reported Hanjin bankruptcy, partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in container liability insurance premium resulting from the Hanjin insurance claim.\n\ufeff\nITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\t\t\n\t\t\nUtilization. We measure container utilization on the basis of the average number of CEUs on lease expressed as a percentage of our total container fleet available for lease. We measure railcar utilization on the basis of the average number of railcars on lease expressed as a percentage of our total railcar fleet available for lease. In both cases, we calculate the total fleet available for lease by excluding new units that have been manufactured for us but either remain at the manufacturer or have not yet entered their first lease, and off-hire units that are likely to be sold. Our utilization is primarily driven by the overall level of equipment demand, the location of our available equipment and the quality of our relationships with equipment lessees. The location of available equipment is critical because equipment available in high-demand locations is more readily leased and is typically leased on more favorable terms than equipment available in low-demand locations.\n\t\t\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWe are one of the world's leading transportation finance and logistics companies. We purchase equipment, primarily intermodal shipping containers and railcars, which we lease to our customers. We also manage equipment for third-party investors. In operating our fleet, we lease, re-lease and dispose of equipment and contract for the repair, repositioning and storage of equipment. We also provide domestic and international logistics services. As of December 31, 2018, our container fleet comprised 1,568,707 CEUs, 96% of which represented our owned fleet and 4% of which represented our managed fleet. In addition, we also own 7,279 railcars, which we lease within North America.\nOur operating expenses include transportation costs, depreciation of rental equipment, storage, handling and other expenses applicable to our owned equipment, and administrative expenses.\nOther specialized equipment is depreciated to its estimated residual value, which ranges from $1,000 to $3,500, over its estimated useful life of between 12.5 years and 15 years.\n\t\t\nRail\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nContainer\n\t\t\t\nOverview\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\t\t\t\nIn May 2018, we commenced an ATM offering program with respect to our Series A Preferred Stock, which allows us to issue and sell up to 2.2 million shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued 428,710 shares of Series A Preferred Stock under the ATM offering program for net proceeds of $10.5 million. We paid commissions to the sales agent of $0.2 million in connection with the sales of Series A Preferred Stock under this ATM offering program during the year ended December 31, 2018. The net proceeds were used for debt repayment and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, we have remaining capacity to issue up to approximately 1.8 million of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock under this ATM program. \ufeff\n\t\t\t\nOther expenses\nDepreciation of rental equipment\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $512.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $261.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of higher net borrowings being required to finance the acquisition of rental equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash inflow from borrowings was $458.2 million compared to $226.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting an increase in investment in rental equipment during 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was also attributable to an increase of $75.4 million in proceeds received from issuances of common stock under our At-the-Market (ATM) offering program and issuances of Preferred Stock in underwritten offerings and Series A Preferred Stock under our Series A Preferred Stock ATM offering program, partially offset by a $40.9 million increase in the repurchase of our common stock.\nLogistics Revenue. We generate logistics revenue by arranging for the movement of our customers' freight through our network of non-affiliated transportation carriers and equipment providers. Revenue is comprised of the gross price charged to our customers.\nOther expense\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our Series B Preferred Stock.\nAsset-Backed Notes\nRevenue\n\t\t\t\nThe increase in depreciation expense between 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase of $4.4 million resulting from a decrease in the residual value estimates for 40-foot high cube dry van containers implemented in 2016, a $1.3 million write-off of rental equipment on lease to a bankrupt customer and a 7% increase in the average size of our owned fleet between the two periods, partially offset by a decrease due to a one-time impairment charge of $2.0 million, related to the Hanjin bankruptcy, recorded in 2016.\nThe increase in net interest expense between 2018 and 2017 was due primarily to an increase in our average loan principal balance between the two periods, as we continue to increase our borrowings to finance our acquisition of additional rental equipment, as well as an increase in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt, caused by an increase in LIBOR, from approximately 3.3% at December 31, 2017 to 3.9% at December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1,358.3 million of total debt outstanding on facilities with fixed interest rates. These fixed rate facilities are scheduled to mature between 2019 and 2043, and had a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% as of December 31, 2018.\nKey Metrics\nOur logistics business derives its revenue from three principal sources: (1) truck brokerage services, (2) intermodal transportation services, and (3) international ocean freight and freight forwarding services. For truck brokerage services, which typically involve a short transit time, revenue is recognized when delivery has been completed due to the lack of reliable information to reasonably measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. For intermodal transportation services, which can take a longer time to complete, revenue is recognized over time by measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, utilizing input methods. For any such services not completed at the end of a reporting period, we use a percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period. We provide international freight forwarding services as an indirect carrier, sometimes referred to as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier. Due to the lack of reliable information to reasonably measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, revenue from these shipments is recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin, which is when the customer is billed and we have no further obligation to the customer.\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our Series A Preferred Stock. \ufeff\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which requires lessors to classify leases as a sales-type, direct financing, or operating lease. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, and ASU 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors. A lease is a sales-type lease if any of five criteria are met, each of which indicate that the lease, in effect, transfers control of the underlying asset to the lessee. If none of those five criteria are met, but two additional criteria are both met, indicating that the lessor has transferred substantially all of the risks and benefits of the underlying asset to the lessee and a third-party, the lease is a direct financing lease. All leases that are not sales-type or direct financing leases are operating leases. The new standard also established a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize an ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than twelve months.\nWe used the proceeds from the senior secured notes primarily to fund the purchase of rental equipment. The notes amortize in semi-annual installments and mature in September 2022.\nOn at least an annual basis, we evaluate our rental equipment fleet to determine whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of all, or part, of our fleet may not be recoverable. Events which would trigger an impairment review include, among others, a significant decrease in the long-term average market value of rental equipment, a significant decrease in the utilization rate of rental equipment resulting in an inability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods, or a change in market conditions resulting in a significant decrease in lease rates.\nAlso included in lease revenue is revenue from management fees earned under equipment management agreements. Management fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the monthly net operating income for an investor's portfolio and recognized as revenue in the month of service.\nRail lease revenue\nLogistics revenue and gross margin\n\t\t\nNormal repairs and maintenance associated with our railcar assets are expensed as incurred.\nFor used container equipment acquired through sale-leaseback transactions, we often adjust our estimates for remaining useful life and residual values based on current conditions in the sale market for older containers and our expectations for how long the equipment will remain on-hire to the current lessee.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOther Debt Obligations\n\ufeff\nRail lease revenue increased between 2017 and 2016, primarily as a result of a $1.0 million settlement with a customer for damaged railcars recognized in 2017, and a 2% increase in the average size of our on-lease railcar fleet. The average lease revenue per railcar also increased as new railcars, which command higher per diem rental rates than used railcars, formed a larger percentage of the fleet.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, change in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditure, or capital resources that are material to investors. An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which we would have: (1) retained a contingent interest in transferred assets; (2) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity; (3) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us; or (4) made guarantees.\nIn August 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,700,000 shares of our 8.50% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share and liquidation preference $25.00 per share (Series B Preferred Stock), resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $41.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. We sold an additional 255,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock upon the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Series B Preferred Stock, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $6.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount. \ufeffThe net proceeds were used for repayment of debt and general corporate purposes.\nStock Repurchase Plan\nWe have typically funded a significant portion of the purchase price for new equipment through borrowings under our credit facilities.
