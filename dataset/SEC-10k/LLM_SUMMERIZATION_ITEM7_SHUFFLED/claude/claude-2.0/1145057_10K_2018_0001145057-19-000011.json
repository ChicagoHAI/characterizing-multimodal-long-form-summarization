MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal year end is December 31.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have recast certain financial data as a result of our adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our adoption of Topic 606.\nOn November 7, 2018, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of SecurityMatters B.V. ( SecurityMatters\u201d). The inclusion of the results of SecurityMatters from the date of acquisition did not have a material impact on our results of operations. As part of the acquisition, we acquired the SilentDefense product line.\nOverview\nWe generate revenue from sales of our products and associated maintenance and professional services.\nWe offer our solution across two product groups: products for visibility and control capabilities, and products for orchestration capabilities. Our products for visibility and control capabilities consist of CounterACT and SilentDefense. Our CounterACT product provides for visibility and control capabilities across campus IT and IoT devices, OT devices, data center physical and virtual devices and cloud virtual devices. Our SilentDefense product provides for visibility and control capabilities deeper within the OT portion of the network. Our products for orchestration capabilities are comprised of our portfolio of Extended Modules. On February 20, 2019, we announced that, in March 2019, our products for the visibility and control capabilities of CounterACT will be offered as Forescout eyeSight and Forescout eyeControl, respectively. Additionally, our products for the orchestration capabilities of the Forescout platform will be offered under the Forescout eyeExtend family of products. We also expect to rename and rebrand the SilentDefense product line as well in 2019. This is a simple rebranding and renaming of our products and we do not believe this exercise will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur solution is available in two product types: software products and hardware products. Our software products include CounterACT, Extended Modules, CounterACT Virtual Appliance, CounterACT Enterprise Manager Virtual Appliances, SilentDefense and SilentDefense Command Center. Our hardware products include hardware that is sold separately for use with CounterACT or SilentDefense, CounterACT Appliances (hardware appliances that are embedded with CounterACT), and CounterACT Enterprise Manager Appliances.\nAlso, we offer our solution across license types and increments. Our CounterACT products are sold with a perpetual license. Our SilentDefense products are sold with either a perpetual license or a subscription license. Customers can purchase in license increments of 100 devices, with hardware sold separately based on customer deployment requirements. Customers can manage their deployments of our products in its varying options that can scale and manage deployments of up to 2,000,000 devices under a single console. Customers can purchase our SilentDefense products in license increments that are on a per site basis.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have sold to nearly 3,300 end-customers in over 80 countries, including 21% of the Global 2000, since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 we sold to 14%, 13%, and 11% of the Global 2000, respectively. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries, including government, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, technology, services, entertainment, energy, retail, and education.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our revenue was $297.7 million, $224.4 million, and $167.5 million, respectively, representing year-over-year increase of 33% for 2018 and 34% for 2017.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to continue to increase the efficiency by which our sales force engages our end-customers, to extend the reach of our sales force footprint to engage more end-customers, to retain and increase sales to existing end-customers, to grow our global end-customer base, and to increase the deal size of sales to our end-customers. While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our results of operations.\nIncreasing the Efficiency by which Our Sales Force Engages Our End-Customers\nWe are focused on increasing the efficiency of our sales force. Over the last 12 months, we have increased hiring in sales enablement and marketing, enhanced sales training activities, and implemented company-wide standards for product positioning in order to instill a culture of success and discipline in our sales organization. Our sales strategy depends on attracting top talent from security organizations, expanding our sales coverage, increasing our pipeline of business, and enhancing productivity. We focus on productivity per quota-carrying sales representative across different levels within the sales organization, and the time it takes our sales representatives to reach productivity. We manage our pipeline on a quarterly basis by sales representative to ensure sufficient coverage of our bookings targets. Our ability to manage our sales productivity and pipeline are important factors to the success of our business.\nWe deploy a direct-touch channel-fulfilled strategy. Our customer acquisition sales cycle is typically nine to 24 months, depending on the industry, size and scope of deployment. Our expansion sales cycle is typically shorter, as customers buy more licenses to cover the additional devices that enter their network after their initial purchase and as we expand into other parts of their network - generally into their other campus environments or beyond campus and into OT, data center and cloud. We have a direct field sales team and a dedicated team focused on managing relationships with our channel partners and working with our channel partners to support our end-customers. We expect to continue to grow our sales headcount in areas of highest demand for our solution. Generally, our sales representatives become more productive the longer they are with us, with limited productivity in their first few quarters as they learn to sell our products and participate in field training, but with increasing productivity as they acquire accounts and as those accounts begin their expansion purchases for additional devices, additional parts of their network, and orchestration capabilities. Our sales representatives annual productivity historical trends indicate, as a cohort, that their productivity in their second full year is more than double their productivity in their first full year and that their productivity in years after their second full year are more than 50% higher than their productivity in their second year. We focus our sales management efforts on helping our sales representatives increase productivity as they become more seasoned. As of December 31, 2018, 50% of our sales representatives have been with us for more than two years.\nExtending the Reach of Our Sales Force Footprint\nWe have made substantial investments in our sales force in recent periods in order to address the significant opportunity created primarily by the increase in the attack surface within organizations driven by the influx of IoT in the campus and data centers, the digital transformation from data centers to third party hosted cloud providers, and the emergence of the critical need to secure OT networks. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in our sales force to capitalize on the market opportunity for device visibility and control.\nContinued Retention and Sales to Existing End-Customers\nReflecting the strategic nature of our visibility, control and orchestration capabilities 84% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 came from our existing end-customers as they expanded their deployment of our solution within their large heterogeneous networks well beyond their initial deployment phase and associated purchases. The chart below illustrates, most profoundly in the most recent years, the annual value of end-customers, as measured as a calendar-year-class-cohort, as they expand the use of our solutions, beyond their initial deployment. The chart shows revenue generated from our end-customers beginning from fiscal year 2007, the initial year of purchase for the 2007 end-customer cohort, along with the annual revenue derived from those same end-customers in each year through fiscal 2018. Each colored segment represents a new cohort of end-customers beginning in their initial year of purchase.\nFor context, we have served several of our top 20 end-customers for over 10 years. Our largest end-customer has spent more than $87 million with us life-to-date and our 20th largest end customer has spent more than $9 million with us life-to-date. We have one end-customer, acquired in 2015 that has spent nearly $40 million with us life-to-date. The number of annual end-customer deals over $1 million and the collective value of those deals continues to increase. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had 49, 48, and 28 deals, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of the collective value of those deals in 2018 and 2017 of 29% and 55%, respectively. We define an annual end-customer deal as the aggregate billings to an end-customer during a calendar year.\nWe believe the net-recurring revenue retention rate over the trailing 12 month period on our support and maintenance contracts is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and increase sales to our existing end-customers. We calculate the net-recurring revenue retention rate on support and maintenance contracts using the following formula:\nX = (A + B + C)/(B + D)\nwhere:\nX = net-recurring revenue retention rate on support and maintenance contracts\nA = annualized value of support and maintenance contracts renewed over the trailing 12 month period\nB = trailing 12 month annualized value of support and maintenance contracts not subject to renewal because the scheduled expiration date of the multi-year support and maintenance contract falls outside of the 12 month period under measurement\nC = trailing 12 month annualized value of new support and maintenance contracts from end-customers that have been end customers for more than one year\nD = 12 months annualized value of support and maintenance contracts scheduled to terminate or renew during the 12 month period under measurement\nWe believe this metric is an indication of the continuing value we provide to our end-customers because it shows the renewal of their support and maintenance contracts on their existing IP-based devices and the expanded value to our end-customers demonstrated by increases in the number of their IP-based devices. Our net-recurring revenue retention rate on support and maintenance contracts as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were 117%, 126%, and 127%, respectively. A net retention rate over 100% indicates that our products are expanding within our end-customer base, whereas a rate less than 100% indicates that our products are constricting within our end-customer base. Additionally, this calculation includes all changes to the annualized value of the recurring revenue from support and maintenance contracts for the designated set of support and maintenance contracts used in the calculation, which includes scheduled expiration periods, stub periods, changes in pricing, additional products purchased, lost end-customers, early renewals, and decreases in the number of devices licensed to be managed by our Software Products or Hardware Products under contract. This metric does not take into account product revenue or professional services revenue. The annualized value of our support and maintenance contracts is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms with our end-customers. The annualized value of our support and maintenance contracts is not determined by reference to historical revenue, deferred revenue, or any other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) financial measure over any period.\nGrow Global End-Customer Base\nWe have invested significantly, and plan to continue to invest, in our sales organization to drive new end-customer growth. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we added more than 500 new customers, of which more than 60 are identified in the list of Global 2000. We now count six of the top 10 financial services companies, five of the top 10 manufacturing companies, 11 of the 14 civilian cabinets with the US federal government, and numerous large healthcare companies as our customers that are standardizing with us for device visibility and control.\nIncreasing Deal Size of Sales to Our End-Customers\nThe value realized from our products has led to increased adoption and larger scale deployments. We define an annual end-customer deal as the aggregate billings to an end-customer during a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our average deal size was approximately $202,000, a decrease of 7% from the average annual deal size for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting the increased quantity of smaller international deals. We define the average deal size as the aggregate sales to end-customers during a calendar year divided by the number of end-customers purchasing in that year, excluding any end-customer for which the total value of their purchases in that year were less than five thousand dollars and excluding support and maintenance renewals, as we determined that the majority of this population was comprised of transactions not fundamental to our end-customer group and go-to-market strategy.\nKey Financial Metrics\nNon-GAAP Operating Loss and Free Cash Flow\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we monitor the non-GAAP financial metrics described below to evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and measure and assess operational efficiencies.\nWe define non-GAAP operating loss as loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Acquisition-related expenses include transaction costs such as accounting and legal fees, and other employee retention expenses arising from the acquisition. We consider non-GAAP operating loss to be a useful metric for investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, a non-cash charge that can vary from period to period for reasons that are unrelated to our core operating performance and non-recurring and non-operating amortization of acquired intangible assets, and acquisition-related expenses. This metric also provides investors and other users of our financial information with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and periods, while eliminating the effects of items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to core operating performance.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be an important metric because it measures the amount of cash we use or generate and reflects changes in working capital.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP operating loss to loss from operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 *As Adjusted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 *As Adjusted\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating loss:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(73,545\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(77,247\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62,149\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>53,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related expenses\n</td> <td>3,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,088\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34,651\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,315\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (non-GAAP):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,735\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,291\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(7,628\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22,006\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,252\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(60,297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,950\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(127,549\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,010\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use non-GAAP operating loss or free cash flow, may calculate these metrics differently, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP metrics as comparative measures.\nAs a result, our non-GAAP operating loss and free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing investors and other users of our financial information, reconciliations of non-GAAP operating loss to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, operating loss, and reconciliations of free cash flow to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view non-GAAP operating loss and free cash flow in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measure.\nComponents of Financial Performance\nRevenue\nWe derive revenue from sales of our products, maintenance, and professional services.\nOur revenue is comprised of the following:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Product Revenue. Our product revenue is derived from sales of CounterACT, SilentDefense, and Extended Modules. Revenue is recognized at the time of transfer of control, which is generally upon delivery of access to software downloads or shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our product revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintenance and Professional Services Revenue. Our maintenance revenue is derived from support and maintenance contracts with terms that are generally either one or three years, but can be up to five years. We typically bill for support and maintenance contracts upfront. We recognize revenue from support and maintenance over the contractual service period. Our professional services revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are rendered. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our maintenance and professional services revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue is comprised of the following:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue primarily consists of costs paid to our third-party contract manufacturer for our Hardware Products. Our cost of product revenue also includes allocated costs, shipping costs, and personnel costs associated with logistics for our Hardware Products. Our cost of product revenue for Software Products includes amortization of acquired developed technology. There is no other direct cost of revenue associated with our Software Products because Software Products are delivered electronically. We expect our cost of product revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on product mix; however, over time, we expect our cost of product revenue to decline as a percentage of product revenue primarily due to a shift in product mix towards increased sales of CounterACT deployed in virtual environments, which does not use hardware provided by us, and Extended Modules.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of Maintenance and Professional Services Revenue. Cost of maintenance and professional services revenue consists of personnel costs for our global customer support and professional services organization and costs paid to third-party contractors that deliver some of our services. We expect our cost of maintenance and professional services revenue to decline over time as a percentage of our maintenance and professional services revenue as we expect to scale our customer support organization at a lower growth rate than our anticipated maintenance and professional services revenue growth rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Gross Margin\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the mix of products sold between Hardware Products and Software Products; the mix between high-margin and low-margin Hardware Products; the mix of revenue between products, maintenance, and professional services; the average sales price of our products, maintenance and professional services; amortization of acquired developed technology; and manufacturing costs.\nProduct margin on our Software Products was approximately 99% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Product margin on our Hardware Products vary. The average product margin on hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT was approximately 24% and 27% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We began selling hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT in 2017. Product margin on CounterACT Appliances, which are the hardware appliances that are embedded with CounterACT, vary. The average product margin on our high-end CounterACT Appliances was approximately 80%, 83%% and 83%, and average product margin on our low-end CounterACT Appliances was approximately 53%, 58% and 60% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We expect our product margins to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on product mix; however, over time, we expect our product margins to increase as a percentage of product revenue primarily due to a shift in product mix towards increased sales of CounterACT deployed in virtual environments, which does not use hardware provided by us, and Extended Modules.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Research and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes consulting expense and allocated costs including facilities and information technology related costs.

Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Sales and marketing expense also includes sales commissions, costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, travel costs, professional services, amortization of acquired customer relationships, and allocated costs including facilities and information technology related costs. Incremental commissions incurred to acquire customer contracts are deferred and recognized as we recognize the associated revenue or over the estimated customer life. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations; however, we expect our sales and marketing expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue in the long term as we scale the business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, professional services, and allocated costs including facilities and information technology related costs. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, and legal organizations. Professional services consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, insurance, and investor relations as we continue to support our growth, however, we expect our general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue in the long term as we scale the business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Interest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest on our outstanding indebtedness.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency exchange gains (losses) related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\nRevaluation of Warrant Liabilities\nRevaluation of warrant liabilities includes adjustments to the estimated fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants outstanding offset by any gain realized from the exercise of outstanding warrants when the fair value of the warrants exercised is greater than the fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock. We mark-to-market our warrant liabilities on a quarterly basis. All of these warrants were exercised as of December 31, 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of foreign income taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, withholding taxes, and U.S. state income taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic net deferred tax assets. Our foreign deferred tax assets are immaterial.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated statement of operations data and such data as a percentage of our total revenue.

For our executive officers, 227,044 of the vested shares were withheld to satisfy the tax obligations due for the RSUs that settled on the Settlement Date. The closing price of our common stock on the Settlement Date was $32.76 per share, resulting in tax obligations of $7.4 million in the aggregate. For RSUs held by our non-executive employees, subject to tax withholding obligations, 55,904 shares were sold on the Settlement Date to cover tax obligations of $1.8 million in the aggregate.\nLoan Agreements\nIn December 2016, the entire loan balance of $20.1 million provided under a loan and security agreement entered into in October 2012, as amended, and a loan and security agreement entered into in December 2013 were paid in full, and the loan and security agreements entered into in October 2012 and December 2013 were terminated.\nIn December 2016, we amended our amended and restated loan and security agreement, which we originally entered into in May 2009, or the Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement, to increase the maximum amount of credit available for borrowing under the revolving line of credit to 80% of qualified accounts receivable up to $40.0 million. In addition, the Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement provides that the combined outstanding balances of the revolving line of credit and the term loan cannot exceed $40.0 million. Additionally, we borrowed $30.0 million under the Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement, which carries a maturity date of December 2020. The agreement is subject to us maintaining an adjusted quick ratio of 1.25. The Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement requires us to pay equal monthly installments of principal of $625,000 and monthly interest payments at a fixed interest rate per annum of 3.25%. Concurrent with the final monthly installment payment on the maturity date, we will be required to pay an additional payment of $825,000.\nOur Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and certain financial and negative covenants, including restrictions on disposing of assets, entering into change of control transactions, mergers or acquisitions, incurring additional indebtedness, granting liens on certain of our assets and paying dividends. We have pledged substantially all of our assets other than intellectual property as collateral under our Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement and granted the lender a negative pledge on our intellectual property.\nWe were in compliance with respect to all financial-related covenants under our loan agreements as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nOperating Activities\nOur operating activities have consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $13.5 million, $(2.7) million, and $(38.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of $16.2 million and $35.6 million year over year for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The increase in generation of cash during each fiscal year was due primarily to higher billings and collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities have consisted of financial instrument purchases and capital expenditures. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $37.0 million, primarily due to the business acquisition of SecurityMatters, net of cash acquired, of $105.4 million, $54.5 million in purchases of marketable securities, and capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $7.6 million related to the continuing growth of our business, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $130.6 million.\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $127.5 million, primarily resulting from an increase of $123.0 million in purchases of marketable securities from our net IPO proceeds received in October 2017. Additionally, there was a $4.5 million increase from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $22.0 million, primarily resulting from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $22.0 million, a large portion of which were related to the build-out of our new corporate headquarters in San Jose, California. Additionally, there was an increase of $24.0 million in purchases of marketable securities, which significantly increased the cash available for investment, offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $24.0 million.\nFinancing Activities\nOur financing activities have consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our IPO and follow-on offering, issuance of shares through our employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by repayments of notes payable.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $25.1 million, primarily due to proceeds from sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans of $31.8 million, proceeds from the follow-on offering in March 2018 of $13.8 million, partially offset by $11.4 million payments related to shares withheld for taxes on vesting of restricted stock units, $7.5 million in repayment of notes payable, and $1.5 million in payments of deferred offering costs.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $113.8 million, primarily due to proceeds of $124.2 million received from our IPO, and proceeds of $1.6 million from the exercise of stock options, offset by $7.5 million in repayment of notes payable, $4.2 million in payments of deferred offering costs and $0.4 million in payment of success fees.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $13.3 million, primarily from net borrowings of notes payable of $30.0 million, net proceeds of $2.4 million from the final close of our Series G redeemable convertible preferred stock offering and $1.1 million from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by repayments of notes payable of $20.1 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3- 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>34,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>6,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract manufacturer commitments (3)\n</td> <td>8,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (4)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Consists of contractual obligations from our non-cancelable operating leases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Consists primarily of non-cancelable license obligations for software licenses expiring at various dates through December 2021.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our independent contract manufacturer.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from sales of products and associated maintenance and professional services. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised goods or services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price, or SSP, basis. We determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.\nThe new standard related to revenue recognition, Topic 606, had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nContract Costs\nIncremental contract origination costs relating to support and maintenance contracts are capitalized and amortized over either the contractual performance period or on a straight-line basis over the average customer life of five years, depending on whether the costs relate to a specific support and maintenance contract or the customer relationship. We determine our average customer life by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology, and other factors.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award. The fair value of a stock option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The\nfair value of an RSU is measured using the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally four years.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of industry peers, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our initial public offering in October 2017, our stock was not publicly traded and we estimated the fair value of common stock using various methodologies, including third-party valuations. After the initial public offering, we used the publicly quoted price as the fair value of our common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. To determine the expected term, we generally apply the simplified approach in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date of the award as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis for an estimate of expected term.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of employee stock option awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected Volatility. As we do not have a sufficient trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option awards. Industry peers consist of several public companies in our industry which are either similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Dividend Rate. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, we use a dividend rate of zero.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our ESPP typically provides for consecutive six-month offering periods and we use our peer group volatility data in the valuation of ESPP shares. We recognize such compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a decrease in federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, a transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. We have estimated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. In accordance with SAB 118, the measurement period is now closed and we have determined that provisional estimates of the impact recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the revaluation of deferred taxes and the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is now final. No adjustments were necessary to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities that was recorded in 2017. However, for the transition tax, additional work was necessary to complete a more detailed analysis of our historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments. As a result, the Company's provisional estimate of $6.9 million of undistributed foreign earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) subject to the transition tax decreased to approximately $1.0 million, which was reported on the 2017 tax return and fully offset by net operating losses.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. When we acquire a business, the purchase price is allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nThe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if certain indicators are present. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed our goodwill impairment test on December 31, 2018 as our acquisition was completed on November 7, 2018.\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, for events and changes in circumstances that may indicate that carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying value to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized would equal the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. To date, we have not recorded any significant impairment to goodwill and other long-lived assets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II. Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for analysis of recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to our business.", "item_7_truncated": "As a result, our non-GAAP operating loss and free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n \u2022 Expected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. To determine the expected term, we generally apply the simplified approach in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date of the award as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis for an estimate of expected term. \nOn November 7, 2018, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of SecurityMatters B.V. ( SecurityMatters\u201d). The inclusion of the results of SecurityMatters from the date of acquisition did not have a material impact on our results of operations. As part of the acquisition, we acquired the SilentDefense product line.\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 Maintenance and Professional Services Revenue. Our maintenance revenue is derived from support and maintenance contracts with terms that are generally either one or three years, but can be up to five years. We typically bill for support and maintenance contracts upfront. We recognize revenue from support and maintenance over the contractual service period. Our professional services revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are rendered. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our maintenance and professional services revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors.  Cost of Revenue\n2018, from 39:61 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Within Hardware Products revenue, the mix among hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT, low-end CounterACT Appliances, and high-end CounterACT Appliances shifted to 35:31:34 for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 6:39:55 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nThe new standard related to revenue recognition, Topic 606, had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nProduct margin on our Software Products was approximately 99% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Product margin on our Hardware Products vary. The average product margin on hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT was approximately 24% and 27% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We began selling hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT in 2017. Product margin on CounterACT Appliances, which are the hardware appliances that are embedded with CounterACT, vary. The average product margin on our high-end CounterACT Appliances was approximately 80%, 83%% and 83%, and average product margin on our low-end CounterACT Appliances was approximately 53%, 58% and 60% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We expect our product margins to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on product mix; however, over time, we expect our product margins to increase as a percentage of product revenue primarily due to a shift in product mix towards increased sales of CounterACT deployed in virtual environments, which does not use hardware provided by us, and Extended Modules.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $127.5 million, primarily resulting from an increase of $123.0 million in purchases of marketable securities from our net IPO proceeds received in October 2017.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if certain indicators are present.

Changes include, but are not limited to, a decrease in federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, a transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. We have estimated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. In accordance with SAB 118, the measurement period is now closed and we have determined that provisional estimates of the impact recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the revaluation of deferred taxes and the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is now final. No adjustments were necessary to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities that was recorded in 2017. However, for the transition tax, additional work was necessary to complete a more detailed analysis of our historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments. As a result, the Company's provisional estimate of $6.9 million of undistributed foreign earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) subject to the transition tax decreased to approximately $1.0 million, which was reported on the 2017 tax return and fully offset by net operating losses.\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

2018:\n\nContract Costs\nWe believe this metric is an indication of the continuing value we provide to our end-customers because it shows the renewal of their support and maintenance contracts on their existing IP-based devices and the expanded value to our end-customers demonstrated by increases in the number of their IP-based devices. Our net-recurring revenue retention rate on support and maintenance contracts as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were 117%, 126%, and 127%, respectively. A net retention rate over 100% indicates that our products are expanding within our end-customer base, whereas a rate less than 100% indicates that our products are constricting within our end-customer base. Additionally, this calculation includes all changes to the annualized value of the recurring revenue from support and maintenance contracts for the designated set of support and maintenance contracts used in the calculation, which includes scheduled expiration periods, stub periods, changes in pricing, additional products purchased, lost end-customers, early renewals, and decreases in the number of devices licensed to be managed by our Software Products or Hardware Products under contract. This metric does not take into account product revenue or professional services revenue. The annualized value of our support and maintenance contracts is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms with our end-customers. The annualized value of our support and maintenance contracts is not determined by reference to historical revenue, deferred revenue, or any other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) financial measure over any period.\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, for events and changes in circumstances that may indicate that carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying value to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized would equal the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. To date, we have not recorded any significant impairment to goodwill and other long-lived assets.\nA = annualized value of support and maintenance contracts renewed over the trailing 12 month period\nThe value realized from our products has led to increased adoption and larger scale deployments. We define an annual end-customer deal as the aggregate billings to an end-customer during a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our average deal size was approximately $202,000, a decrease of 7% from the average annual deal size for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting the increased quantity of smaller international deals. We define the average deal size as the aggregate sales to end-customers during a calendar year divided by the number of end-customers purchasing in that year, excluding any end-customer for which the total value of their purchases in that year were less than five thousand dollars and excluding support and maintenance renewals, as we determined that the majority of this population was comprised of transactions not fundamental to our end-customer group and go-to-market strategy.\nInterest Expense\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\n (3) Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our independent contract manufacturer. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. \nAlso, we offer our solution across license types and increments. Our CounterACT products are sold with a perpetual license. Our SilentDefense products are sold with either a perpetual license or a subscription license. Customers can purchase in license increments of 100 devices, with hardware sold separately based on customer deployment requirements. Customers can manage their deployments of our products in its varying options that can scale and manage deployments of up to 2,000,000 devices under a single console. Customers can purchase our SilentDefense products in license increments that are on a per site basis.\nWe deploy a direct-touch channel-fulfilled strategy. Our customer acquisition sales cycle is typically nine to 24 months, depending on the industry, size and scope of deployment. Our expansion sales cycle is typically shorter, as customers buy more licenses to cover the additional devices that enter their network after their initial purchase and as we expand into other parts of their network - generally into their other campus environments or beyond campus and into OT, data center and cloud. We have a direct field sales team and a dedicated team focused on managing relationships with our channel partners and working with our channel partners to support our end-customers. We expect to continue to grow our sales headcount in areas of highest demand for our solution. Generally, our sales representatives become more productive the longer they are with us, with limited productivity in their first few quarters as they learn to sell our products and participate in field training, but with increasing productivity as they acquire accounts and as those accounts begin their expansion purchases for additional devices, additional parts of their network, and orchestration capabilities. Our sales representatives annual productivity historical trends indicate, as a cohort, that their productivity in their second full year is more than double their productivity in their first full year and that their productivity in years after their second full year are more than 50% higher than their productivity in their second year. We focus our sales management efforts on helping our sales representatives increase productivity as they become more seasoned. As of December 31, 2018, 50% of our sales representatives have been with us for more than two years.\n \u2022 Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of employee stock option awards. \nReflecting the strategic nature of our visibility, control and orchestration capabilities 84% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 came from our existing end-customers as they expanded their deployment of our solution within their large heterogeneous networks well beyond their initial deployment phase and associated purchases. The chart below illustrates, most profoundly in the most recent years, the annual value of end-customers, as measured as a calendar-year-class-cohort, as they expand the use of our solutions, beyond their initial deployment. The chart shows revenue generated from our end-customers beginning from fiscal year 2007, the initial year of purchase for the 2007 end-customer cohort, along with the annual revenue derived from those same end-customers in each year through fiscal 2018. Each colored segment represents a new cohort of end-customers beginning in their initial year of purchase.\nB = trailing 12 month annualized value of support and maintenance contracts not subject to renewal because the scheduled expiration date of the multi-year support and maintenance contract falls outside of the 12 month period under measurement\nInterest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a lower fixed interest rate per annum associated with our amended and restated loan and security agreement beginning in December, 2016.\n \u2022 Research and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes consulting expense and allocated costs including facilities and information technology related costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services; however, we expect our research and development expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue in the long term as we scale the business. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIncreasing the Efficiency by which Our Sales Force Engages Our End-Customers\nA reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:\nStock-based compensation expense is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award. The fair value of a stock option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The\n\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of industry peers, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nWe generate revenue from sales of our products and associated maintenance and professional services.\nIt is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use non-GAAP operating loss or free cash flow, may calculate these metrics differently, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP metrics as comparative measures.\n \u2022 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Sales and marketing expense also includes sales commissions, costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, travel costs, professional services, amortization of acquired customer relationships, and allocated costs including facilities and information technology related costs. Incremental commissions incurred to acquire customer contracts are deferred and recognized as we recognize the associated revenue or over the estimated customer life. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations; however, we expect our sales and marketing expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue in the long term as we scale the business. \nOn April 25, 2018 (the Settlement Date\u201d), an aggregate of 892,996 shares underlying the RSUs held by our directors and then-current employees vested and settled. Substantially all of the RSUs vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition. The performance-based vesting condition became probable on October 26, 2017, which was the effective date of the registration statement for our IPO, and was satisfied on the Settlement Date. For our executive officers, 227,044 of the vested shares were withheld to satisfy the tax obligations due for the RSUs that settled on the Settlement Date. The closing price of our common stock on the Settlement Date was $32.76 per share, resulting in tax obligations of $7.4 million in the aggregate. For RSUs held by our non-executive employees, subject to tax withholding obligations, 55,904 shares were sold on the Settlement Date to cover tax obligations of $1.8 million in the aggregate.\nWe were in compliance with respect to all financial-related covenants under our loan agreements as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 Expected Volatility. As we do not have a sufficient trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option awards. Industry peers consist of several public companies in our industry which are either similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur solution is available in two product types: software products and hardware products. Our software products include CounterACT, Extended Modules, CounterACT Virtual Appliance, CounterACT Enterprise Manager Virtual Appliances, SilentDefense and SilentDefense Command Center. Our hardware products include hardware that is sold separately for use with CounterACT or SilentDefense, CounterACT Appliances (hardware appliances that are embedded with CounterACT), and CounterACT Enterprise Manager Appliances.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nInterest expense consists of interest on our outstanding indebtedness.\nLoan Agreements\nC = trailing 12 month annualized value of new support and maintenance contracts from end-customers that have been end customers for more than one year\nGross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is consistent with the changes in our revenue and cost of revenue.\nNon-GAAP Operating Loss and Free Cash Flow\nBusiness Combinations\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price, or SSP, basis. We determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP operating loss to loss from operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:\nOn October 31, 2017, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 6,072,000 shares of common stock inclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares that were exercised in full. We received aggregate proceeds of $124.2 million from the IPO, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions.\nRevaluation of warrant liabilities includes adjustments to the estimated fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants outstanding offset by any gain realized from the exercise of outstanding warrants when the fair value of the warrants exercised is greater than the fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock. We mark-to-market our warrant liabilities on a quarterly basis. All of these warrants were exercised as of December 31, 2017.\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions.\nOther income (expense), net increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in interest income from marketable securities.\nProduct cost of revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due a $11.5 million increase due to higher quantities of hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT, partially offset by an $8.2 million decrease due to lower quantities of CounterACT Appliances sold.\nOther income (expense), net increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease of $0.8 million in foreign currency exchange losses.\n (2) Consists primarily of non-cancelable license obligations for software licenses expiring at various dates through December 2021. \n\nMaintenance and professional services revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to a combination of a $14.0 million increase in support and maintenance contracts associated with initial product sales, a $12.3 million increase in support and maintenance contracts that were renewals, and a $3.2 million increase in revenue from sales of professional services.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $25.1 million, primarily due to proceeds from sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans of $31.8 million, proceeds from the follow-on offering in March 2018 of $13.8 million, partially offset by $11.4 million payments related to shares withheld for taxes on vesting of restricted stock units, $7.5 million in repayment of notes payable, and $1.5 million in payments of deferred offering costs.\nWe recorded an income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to foreign income taxes, income tax reserves and U.S. state minimum taxes. The increase in the provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income of our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in income tax reserves related to a statutory income tax audit.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing investors and other users of our financial information, reconciliations of non-GAAP operating loss to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, operating loss, and reconciliations of free cash flow to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view non-GAAP operating loss and free cash flow in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measure.\nIncome Taxes\nIncremental contract origination costs relating to support and maintenance contracts are capitalized and amortized over either the contractual performance period or on a straight-line basis over the average customer life of five years, depending on whether the costs relate to a specific support and maintenance contract or the customer relationship. We determine our average customer life by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology, and other factors.\n\nIncreasing Deal Size of Sales to Our End-Customers\n \u2022 General and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, professional services, and allocated costs including facilities and information technology related costs. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, and legal organizations. Professional services consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, insurance, and investor relations as we continue to support our growth, however, we expect our general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue in the long term as we scale the business.  Interest Expense\n\n\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our revenue was $297.7 million, $224.4 million, and $167.5 million, respectively, representing year-over-year increase of 33% for 2018 and 34% for 2017.\n\nProduct revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase of $27.1 million, or 121%, in Software Product revenue. The increase in Software Product revenue included a $23.4 million increase in the sale of CounterACT and a $3.6 million increase in sale of Extended Modules.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n \u2022 Cost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue primarily consists of costs paid to our third-party contract manufacturer for our Hardware Products. Our cost of product revenue also includes allocated costs, shipping costs, and personnel costs associated with logistics for our Hardware Products. Our cost of product revenue for Software Products includes amortization of acquired developed technology. There is no other direct cost of revenue associated with our Software Products because Software Products are delivered electronically. We expect our cost of product revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on product mix; however, over time, we expect our cost of product revenue to decline as a percentage of product revenue primarily due to a shift in product mix towards increased sales of CounterACT deployed in virtual environments, which does not use hardware provided by us, and Extended Modules. \nX = (A + B + C)/(B + D)\nMaintenance and professional services cost of revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs related to an average increase in headcount of 24%.\nOverview\nMaintenance and professional services revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to a $16.1 million increase attributed to support and maintenance contracts associated with initial product sales, a $15.8 million increase attributed to support and maintenance contracts that were renewals, and a $4.0 million increase attributed to increased sales of professional services.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur operating activities have consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.\nGross margin increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by increases in product margin and increases in maintenance and professional services margin.\n\nFor context, we have served several of our top 20 end-customers for over 10 years. Our largest end-customer has spent more than $87 million with us life-to-date and our 20th largest end customer has spent more than $9 million with us life-to-date. We have one end-customer, acquired in 2015 that has spent nearly $40 million with us life-to-date. The number of annual end-customer deals over $1 million and the collective value of those deals continues to increase. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had 49, 48, and 28 deals, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of the collective value of those deals in 2018 and 2017 of 29% and 55%, respectively. We define an annual end-customer deal as the aggregate billings to an end-customer during a calendar year.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nProduct revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase of $57.6 million, or 117%, in Software Product revenue, which was partially offset by a decrease of $20.3 million or 27% in Hardware Product revenue. The increase in Software Product revenue included a $29.7 million increase in the sale of CounterACT and SilentDefense, and a $27.9 million increase in the sale of Extended Modules. The decrease in Hardware Product revenue was primarily due to a $35.2 million decrease in the sale of CounterACT Appliances, which was partially offset by a $14.8 million increase in the sale of hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT.\nOur financing activities have consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our IPO and follow-on offering, issuance of shares through our employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by repayments of notes payable.\n \u2022 Cost of Maintenance and Professional Services Revenue. Cost of maintenance and professional services revenue consists of personnel costs for our global customer support and professional services organization and costs paid to third-party contractors that deliver some of our services. We expect our cost of maintenance and professional services revenue to decline over time as a percentage of our maintenance and professional services revenue as we expect to scale our customer support organization at a lower growth rate than our anticipated maintenance and professional services revenue growth rate.  Gross Margin\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nProduct cost of revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $3.6 million increase due to higher quantities of hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease due to lower quantities of CounterACT Appliances sold.\nWe derive revenue from sales of our products, maintenance, and professional services.\nwhere:\nduring the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was further driven by an increase in professional fees of $3.8 million which includes acquisition-related expenses.\nWe derive our revenue from sales of products and associated maintenance and professional services. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised goods or services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $113.8 million, primarily due to proceeds of $124.2 million received from our IPO, and proceeds of $1.6 million from the exercise of stock options, offset by $7.5 million in repayment of notes payable, $4.2 million in payments of deferred offering costs and $0.4 million in payment of success fees.\nSee Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for details on income tax reserves related to uncertain tax provisions.\nOperating Expenses\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $22.0 million, primarily resulting from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $22.0 million, a large portion of which were related to the build-out of our new corporate headquarters in San Jose, California. Additionally, there was an increase of $24.0 million in purchases of marketable securities, which significantly increased the cash available for investment, offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $24.0 million.\nGross margin increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by increases in product margin and increases in maintenance and professional services margin.\nWe offer our solution across two product groups: products for visibility and control capabilities, and products for orchestration capabilities. Our products for visibility and control capabilities consist of CounterACT and SilentDefense. Our CounterACT product provides for visibility and control capabilities across campus IT and IoT devices, OT devices, data center physical and virtual devices and cloud virtual devices. Our SilentDefense product provides for visibility and control capabilities deeper within the OT portion of the network. Our products for orchestration capabilities are comprised of our portfolio of Extended Modules. On February 20, 2019, we announced that, in March 2019, our products for the visibility and control capabilities of CounterACT will be offered as Forescout eyeSight and Forescout eyeControl, respectively. Additionally, our products for the orchestration capabilities of the Forescout platform will be offered under the Forescout eyeExtend family of products. We also expect to rename and rebrand the SilentDefense product line as well in 2019. This is a simple rebranding and renaming of our products and we do not believe this exercise will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to continue to increase the efficiency by which our sales force engages our end-customers, to extend the reach of our sales force footprint to engage more end-customers, to retain and increase sales to existing end-customers, to grow our global end-customer base, and to increase the deal size of sales to our end-customers. While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our results of operations.\nOur investing activities have consisted of financial instrument purchases and capital expenditures. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.\nOur revenue is comprised of the following:\nThe increase in product margin was primarily due to a higher concentration of Software Products revenue compared to Hardware Products revenue, which was principally driven by a shift in product mix towards increased sales of Extended Modules and customers deploying CounterACT in virtual environments that does not require any hardware being provided by the Company. The mix between Software Products revenue and Hardware Products revenue shifted to 39:61 for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 23:77 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Within Hardware Products revenue, the mix among hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT, low-end CounterACT Appliances, and high-end CounterACT Appliances shifted to 6:39:55 for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 0:50:50 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenue\n\nChange in revaluation of warrant liabilities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 as there were no preferred stock warrants outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevaluation of Warrant Liabilities\nfair value of an RSU is measured using the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally four years.\nOperating Activities\nInvesting Activities\n_____________________\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016\nThe increase in maintenance and professional services margin was primarily driven by growing efficiencies in our customer support organization and the scaling of our prior investments.\nOur Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and certain financial and negative covenants, including restrictions on disposing of assets, entering into change of control transactions, mergers or acquisitions, incurring additional indebtedness, granting liens on certain of our assets and paying dividends. We have pledged substantially all of our assets other than intellectual property as collateral under our Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement and granted the lender a negative pledge on our intellectual property.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn December 2016, we amended our amended and restated loan and security agreement, which we originally entered into in May 2009, or the Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement, to increase the maximum amount of credit available for borrowing under the revolving line of credit to 80% of qualified accounts receivable up to $40.0 million. In addition, the Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement provides that the combined outstanding balances of the revolving line of credit and the term loan cannot exceed $40.0 million. Additionally, we borrowed $30.0 million under the Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement, which carries a maturity date of December 2020. The agreement is subject to us maintaining an adjusted quick ratio of 1.25. The Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement requires us to pay equal monthly installments of principal of $625,000 and monthly interest payments at a fixed interest rate per annum of 3.25%. Concurrent with the final monthly installment payment on the maturity date, we will be required to pay an additional payment of $825,000.\nThe increase in product margin was primarily due to a higher concentration of Software Products revenue compared to Hardware Products revenue, which was principally driven by a shift in product mix towards increased sales of Extended Modules and customers deploying CounterACT in virtual environments that does not require any hardware being provided by the Company. The mix between Software Products revenue and Hardware Products revenue shifted to 66:34 for the year ended December 31,\nX = net-recurring revenue retention rate on support and maintenance contracts\nGeneral and administrative expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $18.0 million related to an increase of 20% in headcount, and includes an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $14.1 million impacted by certain grants that had an IPO trigger. The increase was further driven by an increase in professional fees of $1.4 million primarily related to consulting fees. The increase is partially offset by a reduction of $1.3 million settlement payment to a technology partner during the year ended December 31, 2016 to settle a contract dispute following the cancellation of such technology partner's contract with us. No similar transactions occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of foreign income taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, withholding taxes, and U.S. state income taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic net deferred tax assets. Our foreign deferred tax assets are immaterial.\nWe recorded an income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to foreign income taxes, unrecognized tax benefits and U.S. state minimum taxes. The increase in the provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income of our international operations mainly due to our decision for stock based compensation to be included within our Israeli entity's transfer pricing reimbursement arrangements. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a decrease in worldwide loss before income taxes, which was largely generated in the United States and offset by a full valuation allowance.\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $13.5 million, $(2.7) million, and $(38.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of $16.2 million and $35.6 million year over year for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The increase in generation of cash during each fiscal year was due primarily to higher billings and collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business.\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency exchange gains (losses) related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be an important metric because it measures the amount of cash we use or generate and reflects changes in working capital.\nCost of Revenue\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe have invested significantly, and plan to continue to invest, in our sales organization to drive new end-customer growth. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we added more than 500 new customers, of which more than 60 are identified in the list of Global 2000. We now count six of the top 10 financial services companies, five of the top 10 manufacturing companies, 11 of the 14 civilian cabinets with the US federal government, and numerous large healthcare companies as our customers that are standardizing with us for device visibility and control.\nWe have made substantial investments in our sales force in recent periods in order to address the significant opportunity created primarily by the increase in the attack surface within organizations driven by the influx of IoT in the campus and data centers, the digital transformation from data centers to third party hosted cloud providers, and the emergence of the critical need to secure OT networks. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in our sales force to capitalize on the market opportunity for device visibility and control.\n (1) Consists of contractual obligations from our non-cancelable operating leases. \nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have sold to nearly 3,300 end-customers in over 80 countries, including 21% of the Global 2000, since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 we sold to 14%, 13%, and 11% of the Global 2000, respectively. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries, including government, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, technology, services, entertainment, energy, retail, and education.\nThe increase in maintenance and professional services margin was primarily driven by growing efficiencies in our customer support organization and the scaling of our prior investments, as well as a shift in revenue mix to higher margin support and maintenance revenue.\nRevaluation of Warrant Liabilities\nThe following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFinancing Activities\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the mix of products sold between Hardware Products and Software Products; the mix between high-margin and low-margin Hardware Products; the mix of revenue between products, maintenance, and professional services; the average sales price of our products, maintenance and professional services; amortization of acquired developed technology; and manufacturing costs.\nMaintenance and professional services cost of revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in personnel costs related to an average increase in headcount of 28%.\nThe significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, current deferred commissions, and prepaid expenses and other current assets, reduced by accounts payable, accrued compensation, accrued expenses, current deferred revenue, and current notes payable. Working capital decreased by $91.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in marketable securities, an increase in current deferred revenue, an increase in accrued compensation, an increase in accounts payable, an increase in accrued expenses, a decrease in inventory, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, an increase in cash and cash equivalents, an increase in current deferred commissions, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018:\n \u2022 Product Revenue. Our product revenue is derived from sales of CounterACT, SilentDefense, and Extended Modules. Revenue is recognized at the time of transfer of control, which is generally upon delivery of access to software downloads or shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our product revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. \n \u2022 Fair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our initial public offering in October 2017, our stock was not publicly traded and we estimated the fair value of common stock using various methodologies, including third-party valuations. After the initial public offering, we used the publicly quoted price as the fair value of our common stock. \nThe following tables summarize our consolidated statement of operations data and such data as a percentage of our total revenue. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nInterest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the decreasing notes payable balance associated with our amended and restated loan and security agreement entered into on December 22, 2016.\nWe account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. When we acquire a business, the purchase price is allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nKey Financial Metrics\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have recast certain financial data as a result of our adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our adoption of Topic 606.\n \u2022 Dividend Rate. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, we use a dividend rate of zero.  We estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our ESPP typically provides for consecutive six-month offering periods and we use our peer group volatility data in the valuation of ESPP shares. We recognize such compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nGrow Global End-Customer Base\nOur cost of revenue is comprised of the following:\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe are focused on increasing the efficiency of our sales force. Over the last 12 months, we have increased hiring in sales enablement and marketing, enhanced sales training activities, and implemented company-wide standards for product positioning in order to instill a culture of success and discipline in our sales organization. Our sales strategy depends on attracting top talent from security organizations, expanding our sales coverage, increasing our pipeline of business, and enhancing productivity. We focus on productivity per quota-carrying sales representative across different levels within the sales organization, and the time it takes our sales representatives to reach productivity. We manage our pipeline on a quarterly basis by sales representative to ensure sufficient coverage of our bookings targets. Our ability to manage our sales productivity and pipeline are important factors to the success of our business.\n\nChange in revaluation of warrant liabilities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $0.3 million of mark to market adjustment at the IPO date when the preferred stock warrants converted to common stock warrants, a $0.1 million mark to market adjustment at the IPO date upon the exercise of preferred stock warrants, and an increase of $1.4 million in mark to market adjustment for the pre-IPO period.\nGross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is consistent with the changes in our revenue and cost of revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to an increase in personnel costs of $31.8 million related to an increase of 40% in headcount, and include an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $10.4 million and an increase in commissions expense of $7.0 million. The increase was further driven by an increase in other marketing activities costs of $2.5 million, an increase in allocated IT and facilities cost of $2.4 million, and an increase in travel and entertainment cost of $2.1 million.\nWe define non-GAAP operating loss as loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Acquisition-related expenses include transaction costs such as accounting and legal fees, and other employee retention expenses arising from the acquisition. We consider non-GAAP operating loss to be a useful metric for investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, a non-cash charge that can vary from period to period for reasons that are unrelated to our core operating performance and non-recurring and non-operating amortization of acquired intangible assets, and acquisition-related expenses. This metric also provides investors and other users of our financial information with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and periods, while eliminating the effects of items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to core operating performance.\nResults of Operations\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $13.3 million, primarily from net borrowings of notes payable of $30.0 million, net proceeds of $2.4 million from the final close of our Series G redeemable convertible preferred stock offering and $1.1 million from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by repayments of notes payable of $20.1 million.\nResearch and development expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $12.5 million related to an increase of 25% in headcount, and includes an increase in stock-based compensation costs of $3.9 million. The increase was further driven by an increase in allocated IT and facilities costs of $1.5 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $114.5 million were held for general corporate purposes, of which approximately $11.2 million was held outside the United States. As discussed further in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we will continue to reinvest our foreign cash outside of the United States. If we were to repatriate these earnings to the United States, any associated withholding tax would not be material.\nResearch and development expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to an increase in personnel costs of $11.6 million related to an increase of 43% in headcount, and includes an increase in stock-based compensation costs of $3.9 million. The increase was further driven by an increase in allocated IT and facilities costs of $1.5 million.\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \nWe believe the net-recurring revenue retention rate over the trailing 12 month period on our support and maintenance contracts is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and increase sales to our existing end-customers. We calculate the net-recurring revenue retention rate on support and maintenance contracts using the following formula:\nOn March 23, 2018, we completed our follow-on offering (the Offering\u201d), in which we issued and sold 500,000 shares of our common stock. Further, an additional 4,572,650 shares of our common stock were sold by certain stockholders in the Offering, inclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares from certain of the selling stockholders. The price to the public was $29.00 per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $16.4 million from the Offering, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions of $0.7 million and inclusive of approximately $2.6 million received by us in connection with the exercise by certain selling stockholders of options to purchase an aggregate of 425,436 shares of common stock that were sold in the Offering. The Company incurred offering costs of approximately $1.2 million.", "item_7_text": "As a result, our non-GAAP operating loss and free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n \u2022 Expected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. To determine the expected term, we generally apply the simplified approach in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date of the award as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis for an estimate of expected term. \nOn November 7, 2018, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of SecurityMatters B.V. ( SecurityMatters\u201d). The inclusion of the results of SecurityMatters from the date of acquisition did not have a material impact on our results of operations. As part of the acquisition, we acquired the SilentDefense product line.\nRevenue\nContinued Retention and Sales to Existing End-Customers\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal year end is December 31.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 Maintenance and Professional Services Revenue. Our maintenance revenue is derived from support and maintenance contracts with terms that are generally either one or three years, but can be up to five years. We typically bill for support and maintenance contracts upfront. We recognize revenue from support and maintenance over the contractual service period. Our professional services revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are rendered. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our maintenance and professional services revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors.  Cost of Revenue\n2018, from 39:61 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Within Hardware Products revenue, the mix among hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT, low-end CounterACT Appliances, and high-end CounterACT Appliances shifted to 35:31:34 for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 6:39:55 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nThe new standard related to revenue recognition, Topic 606, had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nProduct margin on our Software Products was approximately 99% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Product margin on our Hardware Products vary. The average product margin on hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT was approximately 24% and 27% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We began selling hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT in 2017. Product margin on CounterACT Appliances, which are the hardware appliances that are embedded with CounterACT, vary. The average product margin on our high-end CounterACT Appliances was approximately 80%, 83%% and 83%, and average product margin on our low-end CounterACT Appliances was approximately 53%, 58% and 60% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We expect our product margins to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on product mix; however, over time, we expect our product margins to increase as a percentage of product revenue primarily due to a shift in product mix towards increased sales of CounterACT deployed in virtual environments, which does not use hardware provided by us, and Extended Modules.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $127.5 million, primarily resulting from an increase of $123.0 million in purchases of marketable securities from our net IPO proceeds received in October 2017. Additionally, there was a $4.5 million increase from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment.\nThrough December 31, 2018, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nIn December 2016, the entire loan balance of $20.1 million provided under a loan and security agreement entered into in October 2012, as amended, and a loan and security agreement entered into in December 2013 were paid in full, and the loan and security agreements entered into in October 2012 and December 2013 were terminated.\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $37.0 million, primarily due to the business acquisition of SecurityMatters, net of cash acquired, of $105.4 million, $54.5 million in purchases of marketable securities, and capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $7.6 million related to the continuing growth of our business, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $130.6 million.\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived from cash received from our IPO and our follow-on offering, and cash flows from operations. Our cash equivalents are comprised of cash and money market accounts. Our marketable securities are comprised of commercial paper, corporate-debt securities, and U.S. government securities. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our products.\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we monitor the non-GAAP financial metrics described below to evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and measure and assess operational efficiencies.\n\nExtending the Reach of Our Sales Force Footprint\nSales and marketing expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $20.5 million related to an increase of 16% in headcount, and includes an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $6.3 million. The increase was further driven by an increase in travel and entertainment cost of $3.8 million and increase in allocated IT and facilities costs of $1.6 million.\n (4) No amounts related to Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740-10, Income Taxes, are included. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.3 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions. \nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRefer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II. Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for analysis of recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to our business.\nThe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if certain indicators are present. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed our goodwill impairment test on December 31, 2018 as our acquisition was completed on November 7, 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a decrease in federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, a transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. We have estimated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. In accordance with SAB 118, the measurement period is now closed and we have determined that provisional estimates of the impact recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the revaluation of deferred taxes and the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is now final. No adjustments were necessary to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities that was recorded in 2017. However, for the transition tax, additional work was necessary to complete a more detailed analysis of our historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments. As a result, the Company's provisional estimate of $6.9 million of undistributed foreign earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) subject to the transition tax decreased to approximately $1.0 million, which was reported on the 2017 tax return and fully offset by net operating losses.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to an increase in personnel cost, excluding stock-based compensation expenses, of $5.1 million related to an increase of 26% in headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million impacted by the modification of our CEO's equity awards in the year ended December 31, 2017 but no similar transactions occurred\nD = 12 months annualized value of support and maintenance contracts scheduled to terminate or renew during the 12 month period under measurement\n_____________________\n\nComponents of Financial Performance\n\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018:\n\nContract Costs\nWe believe this metric is an indication of the continuing value we provide to our end-customers because it shows the renewal of their support and maintenance contracts on their existing IP-based devices and the expanded value to our end-customers demonstrated by increases in the number of their IP-based devices. Our net-recurring revenue retention rate on support and maintenance contracts as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were 117%, 126%, and 127%, respectively. A net retention rate over 100% indicates that our products are expanding within our end-customer base, whereas a rate less than 100% indicates that our products are constricting within our end-customer base. Additionally, this calculation includes all changes to the annualized value of the recurring revenue from support and maintenance contracts for the designated set of support and maintenance contracts used in the calculation, which includes scheduled expiration periods, stub periods, changes in pricing, additional products purchased, lost end-customers, early renewals, and decreases in the number of devices licensed to be managed by our Software Products or Hardware Products under contract. This metric does not take into account product revenue or professional services revenue. The annualized value of our support and maintenance contracts is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms with our end-customers. The annualized value of our support and maintenance contracts is not determined by reference to historical revenue, deferred revenue, or any other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) financial measure over any period.\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, for events and changes in circumstances that may indicate that carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying value to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized would equal the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. To date, we have not recorded any significant impairment to goodwill and other long-lived assets.\nA = annualized value of support and maintenance contracts renewed over the trailing 12 month period\nThe value realized from our products has led to increased adoption and larger scale deployments. We define an annual end-customer deal as the aggregate billings to an end-customer during a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our average deal size was approximately $202,000, a decrease of 7% from the average annual deal size for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting the increased quantity of smaller international deals. We define the average deal size as the aggregate sales to end-customers during a calendar year divided by the number of end-customers purchasing in that year, excluding any end-customer for which the total value of their purchases in that year were less than five thousand dollars and excluding support and maintenance renewals, as we determined that the majority of this population was comprised of transactions not fundamental to our end-customer group and go-to-market strategy.\nInterest Expense\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\n (3) Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our independent contract manufacturer. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. \nAlso, we offer our solution across license types and increments. Our CounterACT products are sold with a perpetual license. Our SilentDefense products are sold with either a perpetual license or a subscription license. Customers can purchase in license increments of 100 devices, with hardware sold separately based on customer deployment requirements. Customers can manage their deployments of our products in its varying options that can scale and manage deployments of up to 2,000,000 devices under a single console. Customers can purchase our SilentDefense products in license increments that are on a per site basis.\nWe deploy a direct-touch channel-fulfilled strategy. Our customer acquisition sales cycle is typically nine to 24 months, depending on the industry, size and scope of deployment. Our expansion sales cycle is typically shorter, as customers buy more licenses to cover the additional devices that enter their network after their initial purchase and as we expand into other parts of their network - generally into their other campus environments or beyond campus and into OT, data center and cloud. We have a direct field sales team and a dedicated team focused on managing relationships with our channel partners and working with our channel partners to support our end-customers. We expect to continue to grow our sales headcount in areas of highest demand for our solution. Generally, our sales representatives become more productive the longer they are with us, with limited productivity in their first few quarters as they learn to sell our products and participate in field training, but with increasing productivity as they acquire accounts and as those accounts begin their expansion purchases for additional devices, additional parts of their network, and orchestration capabilities. Our sales representatives annual productivity historical trends indicate, as a cohort, that their productivity in their second full year is more than double their productivity in their first full year and that their productivity in years after their second full year are more than 50% higher than their productivity in their second year. We focus our sales management efforts on helping our sales representatives increase productivity as they become more seasoned. As of December 31, 2018, 50% of our sales representatives have been with us for more than two years.\n \u2022 Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of employee stock option awards. \nReflecting the strategic nature of our visibility, control and orchestration capabilities 84% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 came from our existing end-customers as they expanded their deployment of our solution within their large heterogeneous networks well beyond their initial deployment phase and associated purchases. The chart below illustrates, most profoundly in the most recent years, the annual value of end-customers, as measured as a calendar-year-class-cohort, as they expand the use of our solutions, beyond their initial deployment. The chart shows revenue generated from our end-customers beginning from fiscal year 2007, the initial year of purchase for the 2007 end-customer cohort, along with the annual revenue derived from those same end-customers in each year through fiscal 2018. Each colored segment represents a new cohort of end-customers beginning in their initial year of purchase.\nB = trailing 12 month annualized value of support and maintenance contracts not subject to renewal because the scheduled expiration date of the multi-year support and maintenance contract falls outside of the 12 month period under measurement\nInterest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a lower fixed interest rate per annum associated with our amended and restated loan and security agreement beginning in December, 2016.\n \u2022 Research and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes consulting expense and allocated costs including facilities and information technology related costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services; however, we expect our research and development expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue in the long term as we scale the business. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIncreasing the Efficiency by which Our Sales Force Engages Our End-Customers\nA reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:\nStock-based compensation expense is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award. The fair value of a stock option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The\n\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of industry peers, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nWe generate revenue from sales of our products and associated maintenance and professional services.\nIt is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use non-GAAP operating loss or free cash flow, may calculate these metrics differently, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP metrics as comparative measures.\n \u2022 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Sales and marketing expense also includes sales commissions, costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, travel costs, professional services, amortization of acquired customer relationships, and allocated costs including facilities and information technology related costs. Incremental commissions incurred to acquire customer contracts are deferred and recognized as we recognize the associated revenue or over the estimated customer life. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations; however, we expect our sales and marketing expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue in the long term as we scale the business. \nOn April 25, 2018 (the Settlement Date\u201d), an aggregate of 892,996 shares underlying the RSUs held by our directors and then-current employees vested and settled. Substantially all of the RSUs vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition. The performance-based vesting condition became probable on October 26, 2017, which was the effective date of the registration statement for our IPO, and was satisfied on the Settlement Date. For our executive officers, 227,044 of the vested shares were withheld to satisfy the tax obligations due for the RSUs that settled on the Settlement Date. The closing price of our common stock on the Settlement Date was $32.76 per share, resulting in tax obligations of $7.4 million in the aggregate. For RSUs held by our non-executive employees, subject to tax withholding obligations, 55,904 shares were sold on the Settlement Date to cover tax obligations of $1.8 million in the aggregate.\nWe were in compliance with respect to all financial-related covenants under our loan agreements as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 Expected Volatility. As we do not have a sufficient trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option awards. Industry peers consist of several public companies in our industry which are either similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur solution is available in two product types: software products and hardware products. Our software products include CounterACT, Extended Modules, CounterACT Virtual Appliance, CounterACT Enterprise Manager Virtual Appliances, SilentDefense and SilentDefense Command Center. Our hardware products include hardware that is sold separately for use with CounterACT or SilentDefense, CounterACT Appliances (hardware appliances that are embedded with CounterACT), and CounterACT Enterprise Manager Appliances.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nInterest expense consists of interest on our outstanding indebtedness.\nLoan Agreements\nC = trailing 12 month annualized value of new support and maintenance contracts from end-customers that have been end customers for more than one year\nGross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is consistent with the changes in our revenue and cost of revenue.\nNon-GAAP Operating Loss and Free Cash Flow\nBusiness Combinations\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price, or SSP, basis. We determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP operating loss to loss from operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:\nOn October 31, 2017, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 6,072,000 shares of common stock inclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares that were exercised in full. We received aggregate proceeds of $124.2 million from the IPO, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions.\nRevaluation of warrant liabilities includes adjustments to the estimated fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants outstanding offset by any gain realized from the exercise of outstanding warrants when the fair value of the warrants exercised is greater than the fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock. We mark-to-market our warrant liabilities on a quarterly basis. All of these warrants were exercised as of December 31, 2017.\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions.\nOther income (expense), net increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in interest income from marketable securities.\nProduct cost of revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due a $11.5 million increase due to higher quantities of hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT, partially offset by an $8.2 million decrease due to lower quantities of CounterACT Appliances sold.\nOther income (expense), net increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease of $0.8 million in foreign currency exchange losses.\n (2) Consists primarily of non-cancelable license obligations for software licenses expiring at various dates through December 2021. \n\nMaintenance and professional services revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to a combination of a $14.0 million increase in support and maintenance contracts associated with initial product sales, a $12.3 million increase in support and maintenance contracts that were renewals, and a $3.2 million increase in revenue from sales of professional services.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $25.1 million, primarily due to proceeds from sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans of $31.8 million, proceeds from the follow-on offering in March 2018 of $13.8 million, partially offset by $11.4 million payments related to shares withheld for taxes on vesting of restricted stock units, $7.5 million in repayment of notes payable, and $1.5 million in payments of deferred offering costs.\nWe recorded an income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to foreign income taxes, income tax reserves and U.S. state minimum taxes. The increase in the provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income of our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in income tax reserves related to a statutory income tax audit.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing investors and other users of our financial information, reconciliations of non-GAAP operating loss to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, operating loss, and reconciliations of free cash flow to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view non-GAAP operating loss and free cash flow in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measure.\nIncome Taxes\nIncremental contract origination costs relating to support and maintenance contracts are capitalized and amortized over either the contractual performance period or on a straight-line basis over the average customer life of five years, depending on whether the costs relate to a specific support and maintenance contract or the customer relationship. We determine our average customer life by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology, and other factors.\n\nIncreasing Deal Size of Sales to Our End-Customers\n \u2022 General and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, professional services, and allocated costs including facilities and information technology related costs. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, and legal organizations. Professional services consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, insurance, and investor relations as we continue to support our growth, however, we expect our general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue in the long term as we scale the business.  Interest Expense\n\n\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our revenue was $297.7 million, $224.4 million, and $167.5 million, respectively, representing year-over-year increase of 33% for 2018 and 34% for 2017.\n\nProduct revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase of $27.1 million, or 121%, in Software Product revenue. The increase in Software Product revenue included a $23.4 million increase in the sale of CounterACT and a $3.6 million increase in sale of Extended Modules.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n \u2022 Cost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue primarily consists of costs paid to our third-party contract manufacturer for our Hardware Products. Our cost of product revenue also includes allocated costs, shipping costs, and personnel costs associated with logistics for our Hardware Products. Our cost of product revenue for Software Products includes amortization of acquired developed technology. There is no other direct cost of revenue associated with our Software Products because Software Products are delivered electronically. We expect our cost of product revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on product mix; however, over time, we expect our cost of product revenue to decline as a percentage of product revenue primarily due to a shift in product mix towards increased sales of CounterACT deployed in virtual environments, which does not use hardware provided by us, and Extended Modules. \nX = (A + B + C)/(B + D)\nMaintenance and professional services cost of revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs related to an average increase in headcount of 24%.\nOverview\nMaintenance and professional services revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to a $16.1 million increase attributed to support and maintenance contracts associated with initial product sales, a $15.8 million increase attributed to support and maintenance contracts that were renewals, and a $4.0 million increase attributed to increased sales of professional services.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur operating activities have consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.\nGross margin increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by increases in product margin and increases in maintenance and professional services margin.\n\nFor context, we have served several of our top 20 end-customers for over 10 years. Our largest end-customer has spent more than $87 million with us life-to-date and our 20th largest end customer has spent more than $9 million with us life-to-date. We have one end-customer, acquired in 2015 that has spent nearly $40 million with us life-to-date. The number of annual end-customer deals over $1 million and the collective value of those deals continues to increase. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had 49, 48, and 28 deals, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of the collective value of those deals in 2018 and 2017 of 29% and 55%, respectively. We define an annual end-customer deal as the aggregate billings to an end-customer during a calendar year.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nProduct revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase of $57.6 million, or 117%, in Software Product revenue, which was partially offset by a decrease of $20.3 million or 27% in Hardware Product revenue. The increase in Software Product revenue included a $29.7 million increase in the sale of CounterACT and SilentDefense, and a $27.9 million increase in the sale of Extended Modules. The decrease in Hardware Product revenue was primarily due to a $35.2 million decrease in the sale of CounterACT Appliances, which was partially offset by a $14.8 million increase in the sale of hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT.\nOur financing activities have consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our IPO and follow-on offering, issuance of shares through our employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by repayments of notes payable.\n \u2022 Cost of Maintenance and Professional Services Revenue. Cost of maintenance and professional services revenue consists of personnel costs for our global customer support and professional services organization and costs paid to third-party contractors that deliver some of our services. We expect our cost of maintenance and professional services revenue to decline over time as a percentage of our maintenance and professional services revenue as we expect to scale our customer support organization at a lower growth rate than our anticipated maintenance and professional services revenue growth rate.  Gross Margin\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nProduct cost of revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $3.6 million increase due to higher quantities of hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease due to lower quantities of CounterACT Appliances sold.\nWe derive revenue from sales of our products, maintenance, and professional services.\nwhere:\nduring the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was further driven by an increase in professional fees of $3.8 million which includes acquisition-related expenses.\nWe derive our revenue from sales of products and associated maintenance and professional services. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised goods or services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $113.8 million, primarily due to proceeds of $124.2 million received from our IPO, and proceeds of $1.6 million from the exercise of stock options, offset by $7.5 million in repayment of notes payable, $4.2 million in payments of deferred offering costs and $0.4 million in payment of success fees.\nSee Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for details on income tax reserves related to uncertain tax provisions.\nOperating Expenses\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $22.0 million, primarily resulting from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $22.0 million, a large portion of which were related to the build-out of our new corporate headquarters in San Jose, California. Additionally, there was an increase of $24.0 million in purchases of marketable securities, which significantly increased the cash available for investment, offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $24.0 million.\nGross margin increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by increases in product margin and increases in maintenance and professional services margin.\nWe offer our solution across two product groups: products for visibility and control capabilities, and products for orchestration capabilities. Our products for visibility and control capabilities consist of CounterACT and SilentDefense. Our CounterACT product provides for visibility and control capabilities across campus IT and IoT devices, OT devices, data center physical and virtual devices and cloud virtual devices. Our SilentDefense product provides for visibility and control capabilities deeper within the OT portion of the network. Our products for orchestration capabilities are comprised of our portfolio of Extended Modules. On February 20, 2019, we announced that, in March 2019, our products for the visibility and control capabilities of CounterACT will be offered as Forescout eyeSight and Forescout eyeControl, respectively. Additionally, our products for the orchestration capabilities of the Forescout platform will be offered under the Forescout eyeExtend family of products. We also expect to rename and rebrand the SilentDefense product line as well in 2019. This is a simple rebranding and renaming of our products and we do not believe this exercise will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to continue to increase the efficiency by which our sales force engages our end-customers, to extend the reach of our sales force footprint to engage more end-customers, to retain and increase sales to existing end-customers, to grow our global end-customer base, and to increase the deal size of sales to our end-customers. While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our results of operations.\nOur investing activities have consisted of financial instrument purchases and capital expenditures. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.\nOur revenue is comprised of the following:\nThe increase in product margin was primarily due to a higher concentration of Software Products revenue compared to Hardware Products revenue, which was principally driven by a shift in product mix towards increased sales of Extended Modules and customers deploying CounterACT in virtual environments that does not require any hardware being provided by the Company. The mix between Software Products revenue and Hardware Products revenue shifted to 39:61 for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 23:77 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Within Hardware Products revenue, the mix among hardware sold separately for use with CounterACT, low-end CounterACT Appliances, and high-end CounterACT Appliances shifted to 6:39:55 for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 0:50:50 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenue\n\nChange in revaluation of warrant liabilities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 as there were no preferred stock warrants outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevaluation of Warrant Liabilities\nfair value of an RSU is measured using the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally four years.\nOperating Activities\nInvesting Activities\n_____________________\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016\nThe increase in maintenance and professional services margin was primarily driven by growing efficiencies in our customer support organization and the scaling of our prior investments.\nOur Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and certain financial and negative covenants, including restrictions on disposing of assets, entering into change of control transactions, mergers or acquisitions, incurring additional indebtedness, granting liens on certain of our assets and paying dividends. We have pledged substantially all of our assets other than intellectual property as collateral under our Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement and granted the lender a negative pledge on our intellectual property.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn December 2016, we amended our amended and restated loan and security agreement, which we originally entered into in May 2009, or the Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement, to increase the maximum amount of credit available for borrowing under the revolving line of credit to 80% of qualified accounts receivable up to $40.0 million. In addition, the Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement provides that the combined outstanding balances of the revolving line of credit and the term loan cannot exceed $40.0 million. Additionally, we borrowed $30.0 million under the Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement, which carries a maturity date of December 2020. The agreement is subject to us maintaining an adjusted quick ratio of 1.25. The Amended and Restated 2009 Loan and Security Agreement requires us to pay equal monthly installments of principal of $625,000 and monthly interest payments at a fixed interest rate per annum of 3.25%. Concurrent with the final monthly installment payment on the maturity date, we will be required to pay an additional payment of $825,000.\nThe increase in product margin was primarily due to a higher concentration of Software Products revenue compared to Hardware Products revenue, which was principally driven by a shift in product mix towards increased sales of Extended Modules and customers deploying CounterACT in virtual environments that does not require any hardware being provided by the Company. The mix between Software Products revenue and Hardware Products revenue shifted to 66:34 for the year ended December 31,\nX = net-recurring revenue retention rate on support and maintenance contracts\nGeneral and administrative expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $18.0 million related to an increase of 20% in headcount, and includes an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $14.1 million impacted by certain grants that had an IPO trigger. The increase was further driven by an increase in professional fees of $1.4 million primarily related to consulting fees. The increase is partially offset by a reduction of $1.3 million settlement payment to a technology partner during the year ended December 31, 2016 to settle a contract dispute following the cancellation of such technology partner's contract with us. No similar transactions occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of foreign income taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, withholding taxes, and U.S. state income taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic net deferred tax assets. Our foreign deferred tax assets are immaterial.\nWe recorded an income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to foreign income taxes, unrecognized tax benefits and U.S. state minimum taxes. The increase in the provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income of our international operations mainly due to our decision for stock based compensation to be included within our Israeli entity's transfer pricing reimbursement arrangements. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a decrease in worldwide loss before income taxes, which was largely generated in the United States and offset by a full valuation allowance.\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $13.5 million, $(2.7) million, and $(38.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of $16.2 million and $35.6 million year over year for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The increase in generation of cash during each fiscal year was due primarily to higher billings and collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business.\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency exchange gains (losses) related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be an important metric because it measures the amount of cash we use or generate and reflects changes in working capital.\nCost of Revenue\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe have invested significantly, and plan to continue to invest, in our sales organization to drive new end-customer growth. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we added more than 500 new customers, of which more than 60 are identified in the list of Global 2000. We now count six of the top 10 financial services companies, five of the top 10 manufacturing companies, 11 of the 14 civilian cabinets with the US federal government, and numerous large healthcare companies as our customers that are standardizing with us for device visibility and control.\nWe have made substantial investments in our sales force in recent periods in order to address the significant opportunity created primarily by the increase in the attack surface within organizations driven by the influx of IoT in the campus and data centers, the digital transformation from data centers to third party hosted cloud providers, and the emergence of the critical need to secure OT networks. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in our sales force to capitalize on the market opportunity for device visibility and control.\n (1) Consists of contractual obligations from our non-cancelable operating leases. \nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have sold to nearly 3,300 end-customers in over 80 countries, including 21% of the Global 2000, since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 we sold to 14%, 13%, and 11% of the Global 2000, respectively. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries, including government, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, technology, services, entertainment, energy, retail, and education.\nThe increase in maintenance and professional services margin was primarily driven by growing efficiencies in our customer support organization and the scaling of our prior investments, as well as a shift in revenue mix to higher margin support and maintenance revenue.\nRevaluation of Warrant Liabilities\nThe following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFinancing Activities\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the mix of products sold between Hardware Products and Software Products; the mix between high-margin and low-margin Hardware Products; the mix of revenue between products, maintenance, and professional services; the average sales price of our products, maintenance and professional services; amortization of acquired developed technology; and manufacturing costs.\nMaintenance and professional services cost of revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in personnel costs related to an average increase in headcount of 28%.\nThe significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, current deferred commissions, and prepaid expenses and other current assets, reduced by accounts payable, accrued compensation, accrued expenses, current deferred revenue, and current notes payable. Working capital decreased by $91.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in marketable securities, an increase in current deferred revenue, an increase in accrued compensation, an increase in accounts payable, an increase in accrued expenses, a decrease in inventory, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, an increase in cash and cash equivalents, an increase in current deferred commissions, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018:\n \u2022 Product Revenue. Our product revenue is derived from sales of CounterACT, SilentDefense, and Extended Modules. Revenue is recognized at the time of transfer of control, which is generally upon delivery of access to software downloads or shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our product revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. \n \u2022 Fair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our initial public offering in October 2017, our stock was not publicly traded and we estimated the fair value of common stock using various methodologies, including third-party valuations. After the initial public offering, we used the publicly quoted price as the fair value of our common stock. \nThe following tables summarize our consolidated statement of operations data and such data as a percentage of our total revenue. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nInterest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the decreasing notes payable balance associated with our amended and restated loan and security agreement entered into on December 22, 2016.\nWe account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. When we acquire a business, the purchase price is allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nKey Financial Metrics\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have recast certain financial data as a result of our adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our adoption of Topic 606.\n \u2022 Dividend Rate. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, we use a dividend rate of zero.  We estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our ESPP typically provides for consecutive six-month offering periods and we use our peer group volatility data in the valuation of ESPP shares. We recognize such compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nGrow Global End-Customer Base\nOur cost of revenue is comprised of the following:\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe are focused on increasing the efficiency of our sales force. Over the last 12 months, we have increased hiring in sales enablement and marketing, enhanced sales training activities, and implemented company-wide standards for product positioning in order to instill a culture of success and discipline in our sales organization. Our sales strategy depends on attracting top talent from security organizations, expanding our sales coverage, increasing our pipeline of business, and enhancing productivity. We focus on productivity per quota-carrying sales representative across different levels within the sales organization, and the time it takes our sales representatives to reach productivity. We manage our pipeline on a quarterly basis by sales representative to ensure sufficient coverage of our bookings targets. Our ability to manage our sales productivity and pipeline are important factors to the success of our business.\n\nChange in revaluation of warrant liabilities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $0.3 million of mark to market adjustment at the IPO date when the preferred stock warrants converted to common stock warrants, a $0.1 million mark to market adjustment at the IPO date upon the exercise of preferred stock warrants, and an increase of $1.4 million in mark to market adjustment for the pre-IPO period.\nGross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is consistent with the changes in our revenue and cost of revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to an increase in personnel costs of $31.8 million related to an increase of 40% in headcount, and include an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $10.4 million and an increase in commissions expense of $7.0 million. The increase was further driven by an increase in other marketing activities costs of $2.5 million, an increase in allocated IT and facilities cost of $2.4 million, and an increase in travel and entertainment cost of $2.1 million.\nWe define non-GAAP operating loss as loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Acquisition-related expenses include transaction costs such as accounting and legal fees, and other employee retention expenses arising from the acquisition. We consider non-GAAP operating loss to be a useful metric for investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, a non-cash charge that can vary from period to period for reasons that are unrelated to our core operating performance and non-recurring and non-operating amortization of acquired intangible assets, and acquisition-related expenses. This metric also provides investors and other users of our financial information with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and periods, while eliminating the effects of items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to core operating performance.\nResults of Operations\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $13.3 million, primarily from net borrowings of notes payable of $30.0 million, net proceeds of $2.4 million from the final close of our Series G redeemable convertible preferred stock offering and $1.1 million from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by repayments of notes payable of $20.1 million.\nResearch and development expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $12.5 million related to an increase of 25% in headcount, and includes an increase in stock-based compensation costs of $3.9 million. The increase was further driven by an increase in allocated IT and facilities costs of $1.5 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $114.5 million were held for general corporate purposes, of which approximately $11.2 million was held outside the United States. As discussed further in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we will continue to reinvest our foreign cash outside of the United States. If we were to repatriate these earnings to the United States, any associated withholding tax would not be material.\nResearch and development expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to an increase in personnel costs of $11.6 million related to an increase of 43% in headcount, and includes an increase in stock-based compensation costs of $3.9 million. The increase was further driven by an increase in allocated IT and facilities costs of $1.5 million.\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \nWe believe the net-recurring revenue retention rate over the trailing 12 month period on our support and maintenance contracts is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and increase sales to our existing end-customers. We calculate the net-recurring revenue retention rate on support and maintenance contracts using the following formula:\nOn March 23, 2018, we completed our follow-on offering (the Offering\u201d), in which we issued and sold 500,000 shares of our common stock. Further, an additional 4,572,650 shares of our common stock were sold by certain stockholders in the Offering, inclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares from certain of the selling stockholders. The price to the public was $29.00 per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $16.4 million from the Offering, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions of $0.7 million and inclusive of approximately $2.6 million received by us in connection with the exercise by certain selling stockholders of options to purchase an aggregate of 425,436 shares of common stock that were sold in the Offering. The Company incurred offering costs of approximately $1.2 million.", "item_7_tables": "Table 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
