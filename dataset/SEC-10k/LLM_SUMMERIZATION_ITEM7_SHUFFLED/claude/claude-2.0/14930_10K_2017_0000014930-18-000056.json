Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCertain statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis are based on non-GAAP financial measures. GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Specifically, the discussion of the Company's cash flows includes an analysis of free cash flows and total liquidity; the discussion of the Company's net sales includes a discussion of net sales on a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions; the discussion of the Company's earnings includes a presentation of operating earnings and operating margin excluding pension settlement charges, restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges and certain product field campaigns charges; gross margin excluding certain product field campaigns charges; and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted. A non-GAAP financial measure\u201d is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and statistical measures.\nThe Company includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in Management's Discussion and Analysis, as management believes that these measures and the information they provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate the Company's ongoing business performance. Brunswick does not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial measures on a GAAP basis because it is unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These items may include pension settlement charges, restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges, special tax items, charges for certain product field campaigns and certain other unusual adjustments.\nCertain statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Brunswick's business and by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Words such as may,\u201d could,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d target,\u201d plan,\u201d goal,\u201d seek,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d predict,\u201d outlook,\u201d anticipates\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations as of the date of this presentation. These risks include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and Brunswick does not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report.\nOverview and Outlook\nGeneral\nThe Company's 2017 results represent the eighth consecutive year of growth, primarily resulting from strong operating performance from our marine businesses.

The 2017 results include an income tax provision of $156.0 million, which included net charges of $61.8 million primarily relating to the impact of U.S. tax reform, including the impact on deferred tax balances from the reduction in the statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, along with an estimate of taxes payable on deemed unrepatriated foreign earnings. The 2016 results reflect an income tax provision of $116.4 million, which included a net income tax charge of $1.1 million, primarily associated with the impact of changes in tax laws partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn December 5, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to exit its Sea Ray businesses, including the Meridian brand, as a result of, among other things, a shift in strategic direction and a review of the expected future cash flows, market conditions and business trends. On May 22, 2015, and September 18, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its bowling products and retail bowling businesses, respectively.\nAs a result, these businesses are being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. The Billiards business, which was previously reported in the former Bowling & Billiards segment, remains part of the Company and is being reported in the Fitness segment for all periods presented.\nThe Company's results for all periods presented, as discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis, are presented on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted. Refer to Note 2 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nOutlook for 2018\nThe Company is projecting 2018 to be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth with improved free cash flow generation. The Company is targeting 5 percent to 7 percent sales growth versus 2017, which includes benefits from the continuation of solid global growth in the marine markets, the success of new products, completed acquisitions and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates. The Company anticipates sales growth in the Marine Engine segment will exceed the market due to contributions from new products as well as expanded and enhanced manufacturing and distribution capabilities. In the Boat segment, the Company expects growth in the fiberglass and aluminum outboard boat markets, including strong demand in the pontoon business. The Fitness segment is expected to report slight revenue growth resulting from the introduction of new products, enhanced digital offerings and a focus on strengthening key customer relationships.\nThe Company is planning to have higher earnings before income taxes in 2018 resulting from increased revenue and improvements in both gross margin and operating margin levels. Operating margin gains include benefits from new products, volume leverage, cost reductions related to efficiency initiatives, modestly positive product mix factors and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. The Company projects operating expenses to increase in 2018 as we continue to fund incremental investments to support growth; however, on a percentage of sales basis, they are expected to be slightly lower than 2017.\nThe Company is planning for its effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 23 percent to 24 percent based on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nRestructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities\nRestructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2017, 2016 and 2015 by reportable segment are summarized below:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash charges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Boat\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Fitness\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Corporate\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total cash charges\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash charges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Boat\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Fitness\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Corporate\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total non-cash charges\n</td> <td>19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on charges and initiatives.\nAs a result of Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment activities, the Company anticipates future cost savings of approximately $4 million in the Fitness segment, with the full impact realized in 2018. Future cost savings will primarily be reflected in the Selling, general and administrative expense as reported on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company anticipates it will incur restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of approximately $3 million in 2018.\nMatters Affecting Comparability\nCertain events occurred during 2017, 2016 and 2015 that the Company believes affect the comparability of the results of operations. The table below summarizes the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the impact of recent acquisitions on the Company's net sales:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition Contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition Contribution\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marine Engine\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,631.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,441.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,314.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Boat\n</td> <td>1,103.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>963.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>879.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marine eliminations\n</td> <td>(258.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(231.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(207.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Marine\n</td> <td>3,476.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,173.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,985.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitness\n</td> <td>1,033.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>980.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>794.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,510.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,153.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,780.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in foreign currency rates. Percentage changes in net sales expressed in constant currency reflect the impact that changes in currency exchange rates had on comparisons of net sales. To determine this information, net sales transacted in currencies other than U.S. dollars have been translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates that were in effect during the comparative period. The percentage change in net sales expressed on a constant currency basis better reflects the changes in the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 20 percent of the Company's annual net sales are transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's most material exposures include sales in Euros, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Brazilian reais and British pounds.\nAdditionally, operating earnings comparisons were positively affected by foreign exchange rates by approximately $1 million in 2017 when compared with 2016, and were negatively affected by foreign exchange rates by approximately $14 million in 2016 when compared with 2015. These estimates include the impact of translation on all sales and costs transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, the impact of hedging activities and pricing actions in certain international markets in response to the changes in the exchange rate between the local currency and the U.S. dollar.\nAcquisitions. The Company completed acquisitions during 2017, 2016 and 2015 that affect the comparability of net sales. The impacts on consolidated and segment sales comparisons are reflected above. Refer to Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nPension settlement charges. In the fourth quarters of 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $96.6 million, $55.1 million and $82.3 million of charges, respectively, related to actions taken to settle a portion of its pension obligations. These actions included transferring certain plan obligations to a third party by purchasing annuities on behalf of plan participants and making lump-sum payments directly to certain plan participants, as applicable. These costs are reflected in Pension settlement charge on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 17 - Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nRestructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges. During 2017, the Company recorded restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $36.6 million, compared with charges of $15.2 million in 2016 and $4.7 million in 2015. See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nProduct field campaigns charge. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $13.5 million charge for costs related to field campaigns pertaining to certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition. The charge consisted of $8.4 million and $5.1 million within Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. There were no comparable costs in the prior year periods. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies for further details.\nTax items. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $156.0 million, which included net charges of $61.8 million, primarily relating to the impact of U.S. tax reform under the TCJA, including the unfavorable impact on deferred tax balances caused by the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, along with an estimate of taxes payable on deemed unrepatriated foreign earnings. The 2016 results reflect an income tax provision of $116.4 million, which included a net income tax charge of $1.1 million, primarily associated with the impact of changes in tax laws partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments.\nSee Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nResults of

Marine Engine segment net sales increased due to strong growth in both outboard engines as well as the marine parts and accessories businesses. Outboard engines benefited from a favorable market environment, particularly for higher horsepower engines, and continued benefits from new product launches and market share gains. The marine parts and accessories businesses benefited from several factors, including\nthe successful execution of the Company's international growth strategy, recent acquisitions and new product launches. Boat segment net sales reflected strong growth in the aluminum and fiberglass outboard boat businesses. Fitness segment net sales increased modestly reflecting growth in international markets while domestic demand was flat. International net sales for the Company increased 10 percent in 2017 on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis when compared with 2016, driven by strong sales increases in Asia-Pacific, Europe and Canada as well as solid increases in other international markets.\nGross margin percentage decreased in 2017 when compared with 2016 driven by declines in the Fitness segment, as a result of several factors, including higher costs, particularly product field campaigns costs for certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition as well as higher freight costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, challenging pricing dynamics in certain international markets and unfavorable changes in sales mix.\nSelling, general and administrative expense and Research and development expense line items increased during 2017 when compared with 2016, but decreased as a percentage of net sales. Both line items reflected increased funding to support investments in new products and growth initiatives, partially offset by cost reduction efforts.\nIn 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $96.6 million and $55.1 million, respectively, of charges related to pension settlement actions as discussed in Note 17 - Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2017, the Company recorded restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $36.6 million compared with $15.2 million in 2016. See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nThe Company recognized equity earnings of $6.1 million and $4.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were mainly related to the Company's marine joint ventures. The Company recognized $6.1 million and $3.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, in Other income, net, which includes the amortization of deferred income related to a trademark licensing agreement with AMF Bowling Centers, Inc (AMF) in both periods, as well as favorable foreign exchange adjustments in 2017 compared with 2016. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the trademark agreement with AMF.\nNet interest expense decreased slightly in 2017 compared with 2016.\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $156.0 million, which included net charges of $61.8 million primarily relating to the impact of U.S. tax reform, including the unfavorable impact on deferred tax balances caused by the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, along with an estimate of taxes payable on deemed unrepatriated foreign earnings. The 2016 results reflect an income tax provision of $116.4 million, which included a net income tax charge of $1.1 million, primarily associated with the impact of changes in tax laws partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments. The effective tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 45.4 percent and 29.9 percent, respectively.\nThe Company's effective tax rate in both periods also reflects the benefit of having earnings from foreign entities in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. This includes entities in Hungary, China, Poland and the United Kingdom which have applicable statutory tax rates of 9 percent, 15 percent, 19 percent and 19 percent, respectively.\nSee Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the impacts of the TCJA as well as a reconciliation of the Company's effective tax rate and statutory Federal income tax rate.\nOperating earnings, Net earnings from continuing operations and Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations decreased in 2017 when compared with 2016, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The decrease in Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations was partially offset by benefits from common stock repurchases.\nDiluted earnings from continuing operations per common share, as adjusted, increased by $0.43 per share, or 12 percent, to $3.89 per share for 2017 when compared with $3.46 per share for 2016, and included adjustments for the following items in 2017: a net charge for special tax items of $0.76 per share, Pension settlement charge of $0.69 per share, Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $0.26 per share and product field campaigns charges of $0.10 per share. In 2016, Diluted earnings from continuing operations per common share included: Pension settlement charge of $0.38 per share, Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $0.10 per share and a net charge for special tax items of $0.02 per share.\n2016 vs. 2015\nNet sales increased during 2016 when compared with 2015 due to increases across all segments. Marine Engine segment net sales increased due to strong growth in the marine parts and accessories businesses as well as solid growth in outboard engines. Both of these categories benefited from favorable market conditions and market share gains while sterndrive engines declined, reflecting unfavorable demand trends. Boat segment net sales increased due to strong growth rates in fiberglass outboard boats as well as solid growth rates in aluminum boats. Fitness segment net sales increased, reflecting the benefit of recent acquisitions and growth in international markets while revenues in the U.S. increased modestly. International net sales for the Company increased 10 percent in 2016 on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis when compared with 2015, driven by strong increases in European and Asia-Pacific markets, partially offset by decreases in Latin America, especially Brazil, and Africa and the Middle East.\nGross margin percentage increased slightly in 2016 when compared with the same prior year period related to benefits from volume increases and cost reductions, including benefits from efficiency and sourcing initiatives as well as lower commodity costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of net sales during 2016 when compared with 2015, mainly due to higher net sales partially offset by increases related to acquisitions and investments to support growth.\nResearch and development expense increased as a percentage of sales in 2016 when compared with 2015 as the Company continued to increase its funding of investments in new products.\nIn 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $55.1 million and $82.3 million, respectively, of charges related to pension settlement payments as discussed in Note 17 - Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded restructuring, integration and impairment charges of $15.2 million compared with $4.7 million in 2015. See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nThe Company recognized equity earnings of $4.3 million and $3.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were mainly related to the Company's marine joint ventures. The Company recorded income of $3.2 million and $5.3 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in Other income, net, which includes the amortization of deferred income related to a trademark licensing agreement with AMF in both periods and unfavorable foreign exchange adjustments in 2016.\nNet interest expense decreased slightly in 2016 compared with 2015.\nThe Company recognized an income tax provision in 2016 of $116.4 million, which included a net charge of $1.1 million primarily associated with the impact of recent changes in tax law partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments. The Company recognized an income tax provision of $83.9 million in 2015, which included a net tax benefit of $12.1 million, primarily associated with the internal restructuring of foreign entities and settling prior year audits. The effective tax rate, which is calculated as the income tax benefit or provision as a percentage of pre-tax income, was 29.9 percent and 26.7 percent for 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nOperating earnings, Net earnings from continuing operations and Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased in 2016 when compared with 2015, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs. Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations also benefited from the impact of common stock repurchases.\nDiluted earnings from continuing operations per common share, as adjusted, increased by $0.57 per share, or 20 percent, to $3.46 per share for 2016 when compared with $2.89 per share for 2015, and included adjustments for the following items in 2016: Pension settlement charge of $0.38 per share, Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $0.10 per share and a net charge for special tax items of $0.02 per share. In 2015, Diluted earnings from continuing operations per common share included: Pension settlement charge of $0.54 per share, Restructuring, integration and impairment charges of $0.03 per share and a net benefit for special tax items of $0.13 per share.\nSegments\nThe Company operates in three operating and reportable segments: Marine Engine, Boat and Fitness.

Outboard engines benefited from a favorable market environment, particularly for higher horsepower engines, and continued benefits from market share gains, including benefits from recently launched products. The marine parts and accessories businesses benefited from the successful execution of the Company's international growth strategy, recent acquisitions and new product launches. Partially offsetting these factors was a decrease in sterndrive engine net sales due to the continuing shift to outboards which is contributing to unfavorable global retail demand trends. Acquisitions completed in 2017 and 2016 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Marine Engine segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2017. International net sales were 30 percent of the segment's net sales in 2017, and increased 10 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 9 percent in 2017, which included gains in all international markets, with the strongest increases in Canada, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nMarine Engine segment operating earnings increased in 2017 as a result of higher net sales and favorable changes in product mix, partially offset by planned increases in growth investments in advance of new product introductions and the resolution of litigation in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n2016 vs. 2015\nNet sales for the Marine Engine segment increased in 2016 when compared with 2015. The increase was mainly due to strong growth in the marine parts and accessories businesses, which included benefits from favorable market trends, market share gains, acquisitions during 2016 and 2015 and new product launches. The segment also experienced a solid increase in outboard engine net sales, driven by continued favorable retail demand trends in overall U.S. and European markets and market share gains, including benefits from recently launched products. The segment reported a decrease in sterndrive engine net sales due mostly to the continuing shift to outboards and unfavorable global retail demand trends. Acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Marine Engine segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2016. International net sales were 32 percent of the segment's net sales in 2016, and increased 4 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 5 percent in 2016, which included gains in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada, partially offset by declines in Africa and the Middle East and Latin America.\nMarine Engine segment operating earnings increased in 2016 as a result of higher net sales and cost reductions, including benefits from efficiency and sourcing initiatives as well as lower commodity costs. Partially offsetting these factors were an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and growth-related investments including new product development activities.\nBoat Segment\nThe following table sets forth Boat segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,103.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>963.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>879.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges (A)\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>71.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20 bpts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180 bpts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nNM = not meaningful\nbpts = basis points\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 vs. 2016\nBoat segment net sales increased in 2017 versus 2016 as a result of strong growth in the aluminum and fiberglass outboard boat businesses and growth in both domestic and international markets. Net sales benefited from increased global wholesale unit shipments as well as higher average selling prices, as customers continued to migrate to boats with more content and higher horsepower engines. An acquisition completed in 2016 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Boat segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2017. International net sales were 27 percent of the segment's net sales in 2017, an increase of 14 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 13 percent when compared with the same prior year period, mainly due to net sales increases in Canada, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.\nBoat segment operating earnings increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 due to higher sales and margin gains partially stemming from improved operating efficiencies, partly offset by increased restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges mostly associated with the closure of the manufacturing facility in Brazil.\n2016 vs. 2015\nBoat segment net sales increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 due to growth in fiberglass outboard and aluminum boats. Net sales growth benefited from higher average selling prices, resulting from a favorable shift in mix as well as a slight increase in global wholesale unit shipments, which was slightly below global retail unit growth for the year. Additionally, net sales benefited from recently introduced new products and market share gains. An acquisition completed in 2016 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Boat segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2016. International net sales were 27 percent of the segment's net sales in 2016, a decrease of 3 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales decreased 2 percent when compared with the same prior year period, mainly due to net sales decreases in Latin America, especially Brazil, Canada and Africa and the Middle East, partially offset by increases in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.\nBoat segment operating earnings increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 as a result of higher net sales and benefits from a favorable shift in sales mix, lower commodity costs and savings related to sourcing initiatives. These factors were partially offset by increases in revenue and profit-enhancing investments.\nFitness Segment\nThe following table sets forth Fitness segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,033.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>980.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges (A)\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings (B)\n</td> <td>64.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(580) bpts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(270) bpts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nNM = not meaningful\nbpts = basis points\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> (B) Operating earnings includes a $13.5 million charge for costs related to field campaigns pertaining to certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition.\n2017 vs. 2016\nFitness segment net sales increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 due primarily to growth in international markets including benefits from the ICG acquisition. Growth in sales to value-oriented franchise clubs continues to be offset by declines in sales to traditional clubs and certain vertical markets. Acquisitions completed in 2016 accounted for 3 percentage points of growth in 2017. International net sales were 46 percent of the segment's net sales in 2017 and increased 9 percent compared with the prior year on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis due to strength across most international markets, especially Asia-Pacific and Europe, partially offset by slight declines in Canada.\nFitness segment operating earnings decreased in 2017 when compared with the prior year resulting from lower margins, reflecting several factors, including higher restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges, costs associated with product field campaigns for certain Cybex products, higher costs including freight, particularly in the fourth quarter, the impact of planned costs associated with capacity expansions and new products, more challenging competitive dynamics in certain international markets and unfavorable changes in sales mix, partially offset by higher sales and cost reduction initiatives.\n2016 vs. 2015\nFitness segment net sales increased in 2016 when compared with 2015. Acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015 contributed 19 percentage points to the Fitness segment's revenue growth rate in 2016. Net sales also benefited from overall growth in international markets as well as modest growth in the U.S., reflecting increased sales to commercial fitness customers including the impact of declines in sales to local and federal governments. International net sales were 45 percent of the segment's net sales in 2016 and increased 19 percent compared with the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions, the segment's international net sales increased 7 percent when compared with the prior year due to strength in Asia-Pacific and Europe, partially offset by slight declines in other international markets.\nFitness segment operating earnings increased slightly in 2016 when compared with the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher net sales and completed acquisitions in 2016, mostly offset by increased restructuring and integration costs, increases in growth-related investments, a net unfavorable impact of sales mix and purchase accounting adjustments related to the three acquisitions completed since 2015.\nCorporate/Other\nThe following table sets forth Corporate/Other results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges (A)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(81.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate operating expenses increased in 2017 compared with 2016 and increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to project and other growth initiative related spending, including investments in technology solutions and IT enhancements.\nCash Flow, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(189.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(172.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total free cash flow from continuing operations (A)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(A) The Company defines Free cash flow from continuing operations\u201d as cash flow from operating and investing activities of continuing operations (excluding cash provided by or used for acquisitions, investments, purchases or sales/maturities of marketable securities and other investing activities) and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. Free cash flow from continuing operations is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP in the United States. The Company uses this financial measure both in presenting its results to shareholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. Management believes that this financial measure and the information it provides are useful to investors because it permits investors to view Brunswick's performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving its goals. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure Free cash flow from continuing operations\u201d is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund investments in future growth initiatives.\nBrunswick's major sources of funds for capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchase programs and dividend payments are cash generated from operating activities, available cash and marketable securities balances and potential borrowings. The Company evaluates potential acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures in the ordinary course of business.\n2017 Cash Flow\nIn 2017, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled $417.2 million. The primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expense items. An increase in working capital had a negative effect on net cash provided by operating activities. Working capital is defined as Accounts and notes receivable, Inventories and Prepaid expenses and other, net of Accounts payable and Accrued expenses as presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets excluding the impact of acquisitions. Net inventories increased by $65.6 million to support higher sales volumes and Accounts receivable increased by $58.1 million as a result of strong sales in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these items were increases in Accrued expenses of $47.0 million and Accounts payable of $34.7 due to higher expenditure levels and timing of payments.\nNet cash used for investing activities of continuing operations during 2017 totaled $165.2 million, which included capital expenditures of $189.3 million. The Company's capital spending was focused on new product introductions, capacity expansion and other profit enhancing projects in all segments. Cash paid for the acquisition of Lankhorst Taselaar, net of cash acquired, was $15.5 million. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's acquisitions. Net cash used for investing activities also included $35.0 million of maturities of marketable securities and Proceeds from the sale of Property, plant and equipment of $8.3 million. See Note 9 - Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's investments.\nCash flows used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled $202.2 million during 2017 and included common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid to common stock shareholders.\n2016 Cash Flow\nIn 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled $423.5 million. The primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expense items. An increase in working capital had a negative effect on net cash provided by operating activities. Net inventories increased by $40.4 million due to increases in production to support higher sales volumes. Accrued expenses decreased $17.3 million which included the impact of the payments of deferred compensation in connection with executive management transitions. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in Accounts payable of $34.8 million, which was partially due to the timing of payments.\nNet cash used for investing activities of continuing operations during 2016 totaled $464.6 million, which included capital expenditures of $172.5 million. The Company's capital spending was focused on new product introductions, capacity expansion projects in all segments and other high priority, profit-enhancing projects. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaled $276.1 million. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's acquisitions. Additionally, the Company had net purchases of marketable securities of $24.3 million during the year. See Note 9 - Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's investments.\nCash flows used for financing activities of continuing operations were $185.4 million during 2016 and included common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid to common stock shareholders.\n2015 Cash Flow\nIn 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled $340.2 million. The primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expense items. An increase in working capital had a negative effect on net cash provided by operating activities. Accrued expenses decreased $31.9 million during 2015, primarily driven by a reduction in insurance reserves related to the settlement of a product liability matter that was mostly offset by a related reduction in accounts receivable reflecting the receipt of insurance proceeds, as well as a reduction in accrued payroll costs due to timing of payrolls. Accounts and notes receivable increased $11.4 million, primarily driven by higher fourth quarter sales across all segments. Net inventories increased $9.6 million due to increases in production to support higher sales volumes and new product introductions; however, increases were at a lower rate than the prior year.\nNet cash used for investing activities of continuing operations during 2015 totaled $68.8 million, which included capital expenditures of $114.1 million. The Company's capital spending was focused on new product introductions, capacity expansion projects in all segments, and other high priority, profit-enhancing projects. Cash paid for acquisitions totaled $29.7 million. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's acquisitions. The Company had net proceeds from marketable securities of $71.7 million in 2015. See Note 9 - Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's investments.\nCash flows used for financing activities of continuing operations were $175.5 million during 2015 and included common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid to common stock shareholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company views its highly liquid assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 as:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>448.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments in marketable securities\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>458.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of Total liquidity as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>458.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts available under lending facilities(A)\n</td> <td>295.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity (B)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>753.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(A) In June 2016, the Company amended and restated its existing credit agreement, dated as of March 2011, as amended and restated as of June 2014. See Note 16 - Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's lending facility.\n(B) The Company defines Total liquidity as Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments in marketable securities as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, plus amounts available for borrowing under its lending facilities. Total liquidity is not intended as an alternative measure to Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments in marketable securities as determined in accordance with GAAP in the United States. The Company uses this financial measure both in presenting its results to shareholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. Management believes that this financial measure and the information it provides are useful to investors because it permits investors to view the Company's performance using the same metric that management uses to gauge progress in achieving its goals. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure Total liquidity\u201d is also useful to investors because it is an indication of the Company's available highly liquid assets and immediate sources of financing.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $449.6 million as of December 31, 2017, a decrease of $8.6 million from $458.2 million as of December 31, 2016. Total debt as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $437.4 million and $439.4 million, respectively. The Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio improved to 22.8 percent as of December 31, 2017, from 23.4 percent as of December 31, 2016.\nManagement believes that the Company has adequate sources of liquidity to meet the Company's short-term and long-term needs. The next significant long-term debt maturity is not until 2021.\nThe Company has executed share repurchases against authorizations approved by the Board of Directors in 2014 and 2016. In 2017, the Company repurchased $130 million of stock under these authorizations and as of December 31, 2017, the remaining authorization was $110 million. The Company plans to repurchase approximately $100 million of shares in 2018, which may be adjusted based on available cash and other investment opportunities.\nQuarterly dividend payments included in the 2018 plan are consistent with current levels. However, the Company may increase these levels as earnings and cash flows improve, consistent with its capital strategy.\nThe Company is projecting an increase in net earnings in 2018 when compared with 2017. Net activity in working capital is projected to reflect a usage of cash in 2018 in the range of $20 million to $40 million. Additionally, the Company is planning for capital expenditures of approximately $215 million to $225 million, reflecting increased investments in capacity to support growth, continued investments in product leadership as well as our decision to increase investment as a result of cash benefits from U.S. tax reform. Including these and other factors, the Company plans to generate free cash flow in 2018 in excess of $275 million.\nIncluded in the cash flow projections are contributions to the defined benefit pension plans of approximately $70 million to $75 million in 2018. These amounts may be adjusted for several factors, including actions to accelerate our de-risking activities, increasing contributions to generate higher deductions at a more favorable statutory rate as a result of U.S. tax reform, market conditions, pension funding regulations and Company discretion. The Company contributed $70.0 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans both in 2017 and 2016. The Company also contributed $3.7 million and $4.6 million to fund benefit payments from its nonqualified defined benefit pension plan in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe aggregate funded status of the Company's qualified defined benefit pension plans, measured as a percentage of the projected benefit obligation, was approximately 80 percent at December 31, 2017 compared with approximately 78 percent at\nDecember 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's qualified defined benefit pension plans were underfunded on an aggregate projected benefit obligation basis by $137.6 million which represented a $61.5 million improvement from 2016. This improvement was due to strong asset returns and contributions of $70 million, which more than outpaced the impact of interest on plan liabilities. See Note 17 - Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company expects its cash tax rate to be in the high-single digit percentage range in 2018, reflecting the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) which reduced the U.S federal statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The estimated 2018 cash tax rate also includes the impacts of an anticipated refund resulting from over-payments in 2017.\nAdditionally, as a result of the TCJA, specifically the imposition of a one-time deemed repatriation tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the Company reevaluated its indefinite assertion as of December 31, 2017. The Company is considering remitting cash back to the U.S. in 2018 from non-U.S. subsidiaries and as such, the Company will no longer assert that it is permanently reinvested in any non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. These remittances would be considered dividends and under changes made by the TCJA these dividends would be subject to a 100 percent dividend received deduction and would not result in any U.S. federal tax liability. The Company is continuing to analyze the effects of the TCJA including the impact on future repatriations and any related withholding taxes from non-U.S. subsidiaries. Future repatriations could result in additional funds to execute the Company's capital strategy.\nFinancial Services\nRefer to Note 10 - Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Company's financial services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nGuarantees. The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with guarantees and repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. Historical cash requirements and losses associated with these obligations have not been significant.

Amounts above also include obligations under deferred revenue arrangements and future projected payments related to the Company's nonqualified pension plans. The Company is not required to make any contributions to the qualified pension plan in 2017; however, $3.7 million of scheduled retiree health care and life insurance benefit plan payments due within one year are included in other long-term liabilities. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential future cash outflows associated with these plans, the Company is unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amounts and periods in which any additional liabilities might be paid beyond 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLegal Proceedings\nSee Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure related to certain legal and environmental proceedings.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nIn its Marine Engine segment, Brunswick continues to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with current and future emissions requirements. The Boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities. The costs associated with these activities may have an adverse effect on segment operating margins and may affect short-term operating results. Environmental regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries may impose more stringent emissions standards and/or other environmental regulatory requirements than are currently in effect. Using its environmental management system processes, the Company complies with current regulations and expects to comply fully with any new regulations; compliance will most likely increase the cost of these products for the Company and the industry, but is not expected to have a material adverse effect on Brunswick's competitive position.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from those estimates. If current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific matters are later determined to be inadequate, results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required. The Company has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on Brunswick's reported results.\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Incentives. Brunswick's revenue is derived primarily from the sale of marine engines, marine parts and accessories, boats, fitness equipment and active recreation products. Revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale, primarily upon shipment to customers, once the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Brunswick offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotions and rebates that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated liability and reduction in revenues for sales incentives is recorded at the later of when the program has been communicated to the customer or at the time of sale. Revenues from freight are included as a part of Net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, whereas shipping, freight and handling costs are included in Cost of sales.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued a final standard on revenue recognition that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. Refer to Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the new revenue recognition standard which will be effective beginning January 1, 2018.\nWarranty Reserves. The Company records an estimated liability for product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. The liability is estimated using historical warranty experience, projected claim rates and expected costs per claim. The Company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and the exposure can be estimated. The Company's warranty liabilities are affected by product failure rates as well as material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure. If actual costs differ from estimated costs, the Company must make a revision to the warranty liability.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles. Goodwill and other intangible assets primarily result from business acquisitions. The excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired is recorded as goodwill. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. All three of the Company's reporting units have a goodwill balance.\nFor 2017, the impairment test for goodwill was a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In this second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.\nFor both 2016 and 2015, the Company determined through qualitative assessment that it was not more likely than not\u201d that the fair values of its reporting units are less than their carrying values; as a result, the Company was not required to perform the two-step impairment test in either year. The Company did not record any goodwill impairments in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and the guideline public company method. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach utilizing a Gordon Growth model. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (Discount Rate) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit's forecasted performance. Fair value under the guideline public company method is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit's financial results. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit's forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts, along with selecting representative market multiples.\nThe Company's primary intangible assets are customer relationships and trade names acquired in business combinations. The costs of amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, typically between three and sixteen years, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. Higher royalty rates are assigned to premium brands within the marketplace based on name recognition and profitability, while other brands receive lower royalty rates. The basis for future cash flow projections are based on internal revenue forecasts by brand, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions, to which the selected royalty rate is applied. These future cash flows are discounted using the applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key uncertainties in this calculation are the selection of an appropriate royalty rate and assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth forecasts, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate.\nThe Company recorded a $13.9 million indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment during 2017 related to the Cybex trade name. Refer to Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The Company did not record impairments for indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2016 and 2015.\nRefer to Note 11 - Goodwill and Other Intangibles in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nLong-Lived Assets. The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets--excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived trade names--and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. Once an impairment indicator is identified, the Company tests for recoverability of the related asset group using an estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the remaining asset group's life. If an asset group's carrying value is not recoverable, the Company records an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over the long-lived asset group's fair value. Fair value is determined using observable inputs, including the use of appraisals from independent third parties, when available, and, when observable inputs are not available, based on the Company's assumptions of the data that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances. Specifically, the Company uses discounted cash flows to determine the fair value of the asset when observable inputs are unavailable. The Company tested its long-lived asset balances for impairment as indicators arose during 2017, 2016 or 2015, resulting in impairment charges of $0.1 million, $2.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, which are recognized in either Restructuring, integration and impairment charges or Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nLitigation. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to claims and litigation, including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company accrues for litigation based upon its assessment, made in consultation with counsel, of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim. In light of existing reserves, the Company's litigation claims, when finally resolved, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nEnvironmental. The Company accrues for environmental remediation-related activities for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated. Accrued amounts are generally determined in coordination with third-party experts on an undiscounted basis and do not consider recoveries from third parties until such recoveries are realized. In light of existing reserves, the Company's environmental claims, when finally resolved, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nPostretirement Benefit Reserves. Postretirement costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions, including the discount rate, the estimated future return on plan assets, the increase in costs of health care benefits, mortality assumptions and other factors. The Company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the realizability of net deferred tax assets and, as necessary, records valuation allowances against them. The Company estimates its tax obligations based on historical experience and current tax laws and litigation. The judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation, as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the Company's application of those laws and regulations. These factors may cause the Company's tax rate and deferred tax balances to increase or decrease. The Company's income tax provision included net charges of $71.8 million as a result of U.S. tax reform.

Cash paid for acquisitions totaled $29.7 million. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's acquisitions. The Company had net proceeds from marketable securities of $71.7 million in 2015. See Note 9 - Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's investments.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and the guideline public company method. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach utilizing a Gordon Growth model. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (Discount Rate) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit's forecasted performance. Fair value under the guideline public company method is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit's financial results. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit's forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts, along with selecting representative market multiples.\nSee Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,033.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>980.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges (A)\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings (B)\n</td> <td>64.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(580) bpts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(270) bpts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) See Note 16 - Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's debt.

Total liquidity is not intended as an alternative measure to Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments in marketable securities as determined in accordance with GAAP in the United States. The Company uses this financial measure both in presenting its results to shareholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. Management believes that this financial measure and the information it provides are useful to investors because it permits investors to view the Company's performance using the same metric that management uses to gauge progress in achieving its goals. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure Total liquidity\u201d is also useful to investors because it is an indication of the Company's available highly liquid assets and immediate sources of financing.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(189.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(172.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total free cash flow from continuing operations (A)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company expects its cash tax rate to be in the high-single digit percentage range in 2018, reflecting the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) which reduced the U.S federal statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The estimated 2018 cash tax rate also includes the impacts of an anticipated refund resulting from over-payments in 2017.\nThe Company's primary intangible assets are customer relationships and trade names acquired in business combinations. The costs of amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, typically between three and sixteen years, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. Higher royalty rates are assigned to premium brands within the marketplace based on name recognition and profitability, while other brands receive lower royalty rates. The basis for future cash flow projections are based on internal revenue forecasts by brand, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions, to which the selected royalty rate is applied. These future cash flows are discounted using the applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key uncertainties in this calculation are the selection of an appropriate royalty rate and assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth forecasts, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate.\n\nRestructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>448.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments in marketable securities\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>458.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 Cash Flow\nBoat segment net sales increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 due to growth in fiberglass outboard and aluminum boats. Net sales growth benefited from higher average selling prices, resulting from a favorable shift in mix as well as a slight increase in global wholesale unit shipments, which was slightly below global retail unit growth for the year. Additionally, net sales benefited from recently introduced new products and market share gains. An acquisition completed in 2016 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Boat segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2016. International net sales were 27 percent of the segment's net sales in 2016, a decrease of 3 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales decreased 2 percent when compared with the same prior year period, mainly due to net sales decreases in Latin America, especially Brazil, Canada and Africa and the Middle East, partially offset by increases in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt (A)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt\n</td> <td>189.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (B)\n</td> <td>152.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (C)\n</td> <td>230.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>228.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred management compensation (D)\n</td> <td>43.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities (E)\n</td> <td>165.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,225.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>319.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>261.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (B) See Note 21 - Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nThe Company recorded a $13.9 million indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment during 2017 related to the Cybex trade name.

The primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expense items. An increase in working capital had a negative effect on net cash provided by operating activities. Accrued expenses decreased $31.9 million during 2015, primarily driven by a reduction in insurance reserves related to the settlement of a product liability matter that was mostly offset by a related reduction in accounts receivable reflecting the receipt of insurance proceeds, as well as a reduction in accrued payroll costs due to timing of payrolls. Accounts and notes receivable increased $11.4 million, primarily driven by higher fourth quarter sales across all segments. Net inventories increased $9.6 million due to increases in production to support higher sales volumes and new product introductions; however, increases were at a lower rate than the prior year.\nCertain statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and Brunswick does not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued a final standard on revenue recognition that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. Refer to Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the new revenue recognition standard which will be effective beginning January 1, 2018.\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nDuring 2017, the Company recorded restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $36.6 million compared with $15.2 million in 2016. See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nThe Company recognized equity earnings of $4.3 million and $3.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were mainly related to the Company's marine joint ventures. The Company recorded income of $3.2 million and $5.3 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in Other income, net, which includes the amortization of deferred income related to a trademark licensing agreement with AMF in both periods and unfavorable foreign exchange adjustments in 2016.\n2017 vs. 2016\nMarine Engine segment operating earnings increased in 2016 as a result of higher net sales and cost reductions, including benefits from efficiency and sourcing initiatives as well as lower commodity costs. Partially offsetting these factors were an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and growth-related investments including new product development activities.\nConsolidated\nMarine Engine Segment\n(A) The Company defines Free cash flow from continuing operations\u201d as cash flow from operating and investing activities of continuing operations (excluding cash provided by or used for acquisitions, investments, purchases or sales/maturities of marketable securities and other investing activities) and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. Free cash flow from continuing operations is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP in the United States. The Company uses this financial measure both in presenting its results to shareholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. Management believes that this financial measure and the information it provides are useful to investors because it permits investors to view Brunswick's performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving its goals. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure Free cash flow from continuing operations\u201d is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund investments in future growth initiatives.\n (D) Amounts primarily represent long-term deferred compensation plans for Company management. Payments are assumed to be equal to the remaining liability. \n \u2022 Deliver revenue growth; \nAdditionally, operating earnings comparisons were positively affected by foreign exchange rates by approximately $1 million in 2017 when compared with 2016, and were negatively affected by foreign exchange rates by approximately $14 million in 2016 when compared with 2015. These estimates include the impact of translation on all sales and costs transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, the impact of hedging activities and pricing actions in certain international markets in response to the changes in the exchange rate between the local currency and the U.S. dollar.\nThe following table sets forth Boat segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n2016 Cash Flow\n\nOn December 5, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to exit its Sea Ray businesses, including the Meridian brand, as a result of, among other things, a shift in strategic direction and a review of the expected future cash flows, market conditions and business trends. On May 22, 2015, and September 18, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its bowling products and retail bowling businesses, respectively.\nCorporate/Other\n (B) 2017 Gross margin includes $8.4 million of charges; and 2017 Operating earnings and Net earnings from continuing operations include $13.5 million of charges, respectively, for costs related to field campaigns pertaining to certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition. \nThe Company recognized equity earnings of $6.1 million and $4.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were mainly related to the Company's marine joint ventures. The Company recognized $6.1 million and $3.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, in Other income, net, which includes the amortization of deferred income related to a trademark licensing agreement with AMF Bowling Centers, Inc (AMF) in both periods, as well as favorable foreign exchange adjustments in 2017 compared with 2016. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the trademark agreement with AMF.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the realizability of net deferred tax assets and, as necessary, records valuation allowances against them. The Company estimates its tax obligations based on historical experience and current tax laws and litigation. The judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation, as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the Company's application of those laws and regulations. These factors may cause the Company's tax rate and deferred tax balances to increase or decrease. The Company's income tax provision included net charges of $71.8 million as a result of U.S. tax reform. See Note 12 - Income Taxes in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nNet interest expense decreased slightly in 2017 compared with 2016.\nNet earnings from continuing operations decreased to $187.3 million in 2017 from $272.6 million in 2016. The 2017 results include an income tax provision of $156.0 million, which included net charges of $61.8 million primarily relating to the impact of U.S. tax reform, including the impact on deferred tax balances from the reduction in the statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, along with an estimate of taxes payable on deemed unrepatriated foreign earnings. The 2016 results reflect an income tax provision of $116.4 million, which included a net income tax charge of $1.1 million, primarily associated with the impact of changes in tax laws partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments.\n (C) Purchase obligations represent agreements with suppliers and vendors at the end of 2017 for raw materials and other supplies as part of the normal course of business. \nGross margin percentage decreased in 2017 when compared with 2016 driven by declines in the Fitness segment, as a result of several factors, including higher costs, particularly product field campaigns costs for certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition as well as higher freight costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, challenging pricing dynamics in certain international markets and unfavorable changes in sales mix.\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from those estimates. If current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific matters are later determined to be inadequate, results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required. The Company has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on Brunswick's reported results.\n\nFitness segment net sales increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 due primarily to growth in international markets including benefits from the ICG acquisition. Growth in sales to value-oriented franchise clubs continues to be offset by declines in sales to traditional clubs and certain vertical markets. Acquisitions completed in 2016 accounted for 3 percentage points of growth in 2017. International net sales were 46 percent of the segment's net sales in 2017 and increased 9 percent compared with the prior year on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis due to strength across most international markets, especially Asia-Pacific and Europe, partially offset by slight declines in Canada.\n \u2022 Ended the year with a 9 percent increase in net sales when compared with 2016 on a GAAP basis and 8 percent on a constant currency basis, due to the following: \nAs a result of Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment activities, the Company anticipates future cost savings of approximately $4 million in the Fitness segment, with the full impact realized in 2018. Future cost savings will primarily be reflected in the Selling, general and administrative expense as reported on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAcquisitions. The Company completed acquisitions during 2017, 2016 and 2015 that affect the comparability of net sales. The impacts on consolidated and segment sales comparisons are reflected above. Refer to Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nRefer to Note 11 - Goodwill and Other Intangibles in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nGross margin percentage increased slightly in 2016 when compared with the same prior year period related to benefits from volume increases and cost reductions, including benefits from efficiency and sourcing initiatives as well as lower commodity costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.\nSee Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on charges and initiatives.\nThe following table sets forth Corporate/Other results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nBoat segment net sales increased in 2017 versus 2016 as a result of strong growth in the aluminum and fiberglass outboard boat businesses and growth in both domestic and international markets. Net sales benefited from increased global wholesale unit shipments as well as higher average selling prices, as customers continued to migrate to boats with more content and higher horsepower engines. An acquisition completed in 2016 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Boat segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2017. International net sales were 27 percent of the segment's net sales in 2017, an increase of 14 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 13 percent when compared with the same prior year period, mainly due to net sales increases in Canada, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.\nThe Company is planning to have higher earnings before income taxes in 2018 resulting from increased revenue and improvements in both gross margin and operating margin levels. Operating margin gains include benefits from new products, volume leverage, cost reductions related to efficiency initiatives, modestly positive product mix factors and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. The Company projects operating expenses to increase in 2018 as we continue to fund incremental investments to support growth; however, on a percentage of sales basis, they are expected to be slightly lower than 2017.\nAchievements against the Company's financial objectives in 2017 were as follows:\nFitness segment operating earnings increased slightly in 2016 when compared with the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher net sales and completed acquisitions in 2016, mostly offset by increased restructuring and integration costs, increases in growth-related investments, a net unfavorable impact of sales mix and purchase accounting adjustments related to the three acquisitions completed since 2015.\nCorporate operating expenses increased in 2017 compared with 2016 and increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to project and other growth initiative related spending, including investments in technology solutions and IT enhancements.\n__________\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company anticipates it will incur restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of approximately $3 million in 2018.\nFinancial Services\nSegments\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded restructuring, integration and impairment charges of $15.2 million compared with $4.7 million in 2015. See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\n \u2022 Enhanced shareholder returns in 2017 by repurchasing $130.0 million of common stock under the Company's share repurchase program and increased cash dividends paid to shareholders to $60.6 million. \n__________\nLegal Proceedings\nCash flows used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled $202.2 million during 2017 and included common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid to common stock shareholders.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNM = not meaningful\nNM = not meaningful\nLong-Lived Assets. The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets--excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived trade names--and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. Once an impairment indicator is identified, the Company tests for recoverability of the related asset group using an estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the remaining asset group's life. If an asset group's carrying value is not recoverable, the Company records an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over the long-lived asset group's fair value. Fair value is determined using observable inputs, including the use of appraisals from independent third parties, when available, and, when observable inputs are not available, based on the Company's assumptions of the data that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances. Specifically, the Company uses discounted cash flows to determine the fair value of the asset when observable inputs are unavailable. The Company tested its long-lived asset balances for impairment as indicators arose during 2017, 2016 or 2015, resulting in impairment charges of $0.1 million, $2.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, which are recognized in either Restructuring, integration and impairment charges or Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nEnvironmental. The Company accrues for environmental remediation-related activities for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated. Accrued amounts are generally determined in coordination with third-party experts on an undiscounted basis and do not consider recoveries from third parties until such recoveries are realized. In light of existing reserves, the Company's environmental claims, when finally resolved, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nExperience an increase in earnings before income taxes, as well as deliver improvements in both gross margin and operating margin percentages:\nThe Company includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in Management's Discussion and Analysis, as management believes that these measures and the information they provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate the Company's ongoing business performance. Brunswick does not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial measures on a GAAP basis because it is unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These items may include pension settlement charges, restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges, special tax items, charges for certain product field campaigns and certain other unusual adjustments.\n \u2022 Reported earnings before income taxes of $343.3 million in 2017 compared with earnings before income taxes of $389.0 million in 2016; adjusted earnings before income taxes were $490.0 million in 2017 versus $459.3 million in 2016; \nIn its Marine Engine segment, Brunswick continues to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with current and future emissions requirements. The Boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities. The costs associated with these activities may have an adverse effect on segment operating margins and may affect short-term operating results. Environmental regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries may impose more stringent emissions standards and/or other environmental regulatory requirements than are currently in effect. Using its environmental management system processes, the Company complies with current regulations and expects to comply fully with any new regulations; compliance will most likely increase the cost of these products for the Company and the industry, but is not expected to have a material adverse effect on Brunswick's competitive position.\nCash flows used for financing activities of continuing operations were $185.4 million during 2016 and included common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid to common stock shareholders.\nbpts = basis points\n \u2022 Continue to generate strong free cash flow and execute against the Company's capital strategy. \nPostretirement Benefit Reserves. Postretirement costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions, including the discount rate, the estimated future return on plan assets, the increase in costs of health care benefits, mortality assumptions and other factors. The Company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.\n__________\n \u2022 Strong growth in all three primary boat categories and the outboard engine business, along with solid growth in the marine parts and accessories businesses; \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nDeliver revenue growth:\nbpts = basis points\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Incentives. Brunswick's revenue is derived primarily from the sale of marine engines, marine parts and accessories, boats, fitness equipment and active recreation products. Revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale, primarily upon shipment to customers, once the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Brunswick offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotions and rebates that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated liability and reduction in revenues for sales incentives is recorded at the later of when the program has been communicated to the customer or at the time of sale. Revenues from freight are included as a part of Net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, whereas shipping, freight and handling costs are included in Cost of sales.\n\nThe Company is projecting an increase in net earnings in 2018 when compared with 2017. Net activity in working capital is projected to reflect a usage of cash in 2018 in the range of $20 million to $40 million. Additionally, the Company is planning for capital expenditures of approximately $215 million to $225 million, reflecting increased investments in capacity to support growth, continued investments in product leadership as well as our decision to increase investment as a result of cash benefits from U.S. tax reform. Including these and other factors, the Company plans to generate free cash flow in 2018 in excess of $275 million.\nThe Company recognized an income tax provision in 2016 of $116.4 million, which included a net charge of $1.1 million primarily associated with the impact of recent changes in tax law partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments. The Company recognized an income tax provision of $83.9 million in 2015, which included a net tax benefit of $12.1 million, primarily associated with the internal restructuring of foreign entities and settling prior year audits. The effective tax rate, which is calculated as the income tax benefit or provision as a percentage of pre-tax income, was 29.9 percent and 26.7 percent for 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\n2017 vs. 2016\nIn 2017, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled $417.2 million. The primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expense items. An increase in working capital had a negative effect on net cash provided by operating activities. Working capital is defined as Accounts and notes receivable, Inventories and Prepaid expenses and other, net of Accounts payable and Accrued expenses as presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets excluding the impact of acquisitions. Net inventories increased by $65.6 million to support higher sales volumes and Accounts receivable increased by $58.1 million as a result of strong sales in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these items were increases in Accrued expenses of $47.0 million and Accounts payable of $34.7 due to higher expenditure levels and timing of payments.\n\n \u2022 Gross margin declined 100 basis points when compared with 2016, driven mainly by declines in the Fitness segment due to higher costs, particularly product field campaigns costs for certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition as well as freight costs in the fourth quarter, challenging pricing dynamics in certain international markets and unfavorable changes in sales mix; gross margin, as adjusted, declined 80 basis points when compared with 2016; \nDiscontinued Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nbpts = basis points\nWarranty Reserves. The Company records an estimated liability for product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. The liability is estimated using historical warranty experience, projected claim rates and expected costs per claim. The Company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and the exposure can be estimated. The Company's warranty liabilities are affected by product failure rates as well as material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure. If actual costs differ from estimated costs, the Company must make a revision to the warranty liability.\nBoat segment operating earnings increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 as a result of higher net sales and benefits from a favorable shift in sales mix, lower commodity costs and savings related to sourcing initiatives. These factors were partially offset by increases in revenue and profit-enhancing investments.\nIncluded in the cash flow projections are contributions to the defined benefit pension plans of approximately $70 million to $75 million in 2018. These amounts may be adjusted for several factors, including actions to accelerate our de-risking activities, increasing contributions to generate higher deductions at a more favorable statutory rate as a result of U.S. tax reform, market conditions, pension funding regulations and Company discretion. The Company contributed $70.0 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans both in 2017 and 2016. The Company also contributed $3.7 million and $4.6 million to fund benefit payments from its nonqualified defined benefit pension plan in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSee Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the recent accounting pronouncements that have been adopted during the year ended December 31, 2017, or will be adopted in future periods.\n (A) See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.  (B) Operating earnings includes a $13.5 million charge for costs related to field campaigns pertaining to certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition.\nSelling, general and administrative expense and Research and development expense line items increased during 2017 when compared with 2016, but decreased as a percentage of net sales. Both line items reflected increased funding to support investments in new products and growth initiatives, partially offset by cost reduction efforts.\nContractual Obligations\n\nthe successful execution of the Company's international growth strategy, recent acquisitions and new product launches. Boat segment net sales reflected strong growth in the aluminum and fiberglass outboard boat businesses. Fitness segment net sales increased modestly reflecting growth in international markets while domestic demand was flat. International net sales for the Company increased 10 percent in 2017 on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis when compared with 2016, driven by strong sales increases in Asia-Pacific, Europe and Canada as well as solid increases in other international markets.\nMarine Engine segment operating earnings increased in 2017 as a result of higher net sales and favorable changes in product mix, partially offset by planned increases in growth investments in advance of new product introductions and the resolution of litigation in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n2016 vs. 2015\nTax items. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $156.0 million, which included net charges of $61.8 million, primarily relating to the impact of U.S. tax reform under the TCJA, including the unfavorable impact on deferred tax balances caused by the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, along with an estimate of taxes payable on deemed unrepatriated foreign earnings. The 2016 results reflect an income tax provision of $116.4 million, which included a net income tax charge of $1.1 million, primarily associated with the impact of changes in tax laws partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments.\n__________\nRefer to Note 10 - Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Company's financial services.\nGuarantees. The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with guarantees and repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. Historical cash requirements and losses associated with these obligations have not been significant. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these arrangements.\nThe Company's effective tax rate in both periods also reflects the benefit of having earnings from foreign entities in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. This includes entities in Hungary, China, Poland and the United Kingdom which have applicable statutory tax rates of 9 percent, 15 percent, 19 percent and 19 percent, respectively.\n (A) See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. \nProduct field campaigns charge. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $13.5 million charge for costs related to field campaigns pertaining to certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition. The charge consisted of $8.4 million and $5.1 million within Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. There were no comparable costs in the prior year periods. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies for further details.\nManagement believes that the Company has adequate sources of liquidity to meet the Company's short-term and long-term needs. The next significant long-term debt maturity is not until 2021.\nGeneral\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $156.0 million, which included net charges of $61.8 million primarily relating to the impact of U.S. tax reform, including the unfavorable impact on deferred tax balances caused by the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, along with an estimate of taxes payable on deemed unrepatriated foreign earnings. The 2016 results reflect an income tax provision of $116.4 million, which included a net income tax charge of $1.1 million, primarily associated with the impact of changes in tax laws partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments. The effective tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 45.4 percent and 29.9 percent, respectively.\nThe Company's results for all periods presented, as discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis, are presented on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted. Refer to Note 2 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nCertain events occurred during 2017, 2016 and 2015 that the Company believes affect the comparability of the results of operations. The table below summarizes the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the impact of recent acquisitions on the Company's net sales:\n(A) In June 2016, the Company amended and restated its existing credit agreement, dated as of March 2011, as amended and restated as of June 2014. See Note 16 - Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's lending facility.\nCash Flow, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 Funded investments in growth: \nThe following table sets forth a summary of the Company's contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nMarine Engine segment net sales increased in 2017 versus 2016 due to strong growth in both outboard engines and the marine parts and accessories businesses. Outboard engines benefited from a favorable market environment, particularly for higher horsepower engines, and continued benefits from market share gains, including benefits from recently launched products. The marine parts and accessories businesses benefited from the successful execution of the Company's international growth strategy, recent acquisitions and new product launches. Partially offsetting these factors was a decrease in sterndrive engine net sales due to the continuing shift to outboards which is contributing to unfavorable global retail demand trends. Acquisitions completed in 2017 and 2016 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Marine Engine segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2017. International net sales were 30 percent of the segment's net sales in 2017, and increased 10 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 9 percent in 2017, which included gains in all international markets, with the strongest increases in Canada, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nBoat Segment\nDiluted earnings from continuing operations per common share, as adjusted, increased by $0.43 per share, or 12 percent, to $3.89 per share for 2017 when compared with $3.46 per share for 2016, and included adjustments for the following items in 2017: a net charge for special tax items of $0.76 per share, Pension settlement charge of $0.69 per share, Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $0.26 per share and product field campaigns charges of $0.10 per share. In 2016, Diluted earnings from continuing operations per common share included: Pension settlement charge of $0.38 per share, Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $0.10 per share and a net charge for special tax items of $0.02 per share.\nIn 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $55.1 million and $82.3 million, respectively, of charges related to pension settlement payments as discussed in Note 17 - Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company views its highly liquid assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 as:\nDecember 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's qualified defined benefit pension plans were underfunded on an aggregate projected benefit obligation basis by $137.6 million which represented a $61.5 million improvement from 2016. This improvement was due to strong asset returns and contributions of $70 million, which more than outpaced the impact of interest on plan liabilities. See Note 17 - Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\nOverview and Outlook\nLitigation. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to claims and litigation, including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company accrues for litigation based upon its assessment, made in consultation with counsel, of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim. In light of existing reserves, the Company's litigation claims, when finally resolved, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRestructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges. During 2017, the Company recorded restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $36.6 million, compared with charges of $15.2 million in 2016 and $4.7 million in 2015. See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\n2017 vs. 2016\nAdditionally, as a result of the TCJA, specifically the imposition of a one-time deemed repatriation tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the Company reevaluated its indefinite assertion as of December 31, 2017. The Company is considering remitting cash back to the U.S. in 2018 from non-U.S. subsidiaries and as such, the Company will no longer assert that it is permanently reinvested in any non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. These remittances would be considered dividends and under changes made by the TCJA these dividends would be subject to a 100 percent dividend received deduction and would not result in any U.S. federal tax liability. The Company is continuing to analyze the effects of the TCJA including the impact on future repatriations and any related withholding taxes from non-U.S. subsidiaries. Future repatriations could result in additional funds to execute the Company's capital strategy.\n \u2022 The Marine Engine and Boat segments benefited from strong global market demand, as domestic markets continued to grow and international markets benefited from gains in Europe, Canada and Asia-Pacific, as well as improving conditions in other regions; \nThe following table sets forth Fitness segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nOperating earnings, Net earnings from continuing operations and Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased in 2016 when compared with 2015, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs. Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations also benefited from the impact of common stock repurchases.\nThe Company's 2017 results represent the eighth consecutive year of growth, primarily resulting from strong operating performance from our marine businesses. The Company looked to achieve the following financial objectives in 2017:\n (E) Other long-term liabilities include amounts recorded as secured obligations for lease and other long-term receivables originated by the Company and assigned to third parties where the transfer of assets do not meet the conditions for a sale as a result of the Company's contingent obligation to repurchase the receivables in the event of customer non-payment. Amounts above also include obligations under deferred revenue arrangements and future projected payments related to the Company's nonqualified pension plans. The Company is not required to make any contributions to the qualified pension plan in 2017; however, $3.7 million of scheduled retiree health care and life insurance benefit plan payments due within one year are included in other long-term liabilities. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential future cash outflows associated with these plans, the Company is unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amounts and periods in which any additional liabilities might be paid beyond 2017. \n2016 vs. 2015\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $449.6 million as of December 31, 2017, a decrease of $8.6 million from $458.2 million as of December 31, 2016. Total debt as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $437.4 million and $439.4 million, respectively. The Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio improved to 22.8 percent as of December 31, 2017, from 23.4 percent as of December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used for investing activities of continuing operations during 2017 totaled $165.2 million, which included capital expenditures of $189.3 million. The Company's capital spending was focused on new product introductions, capacity expansion and other profit enhancing projects in all segments. Cash paid for the acquisition of Lankhorst Taselaar, net of cash acquired, was $15.5 million. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's acquisitions. Net cash used for investing activities also included $35.0 million of maturities of marketable securities and Proceeds from the sale of Property, plant and equipment of $8.3 million. See Note 9 - Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's investments.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled $423.5 million. The primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expense items. An increase in working capital had a negative effect on net cash provided by operating activities. Net inventories increased by $40.4 million due to increases in production to support higher sales volumes. Accrued expenses decreased $17.3 million which included the impact of the payments of deferred compensation in connection with executive management transitions. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in Accounts payable of $34.8 million, which was partially due to the timing of payments.\n2016 vs. 2015\nCash flows used for financing activities of continuing operations were $175.5 million during 2015 and included common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid to common stock shareholders.\n \u2022 Increase earnings before income taxes, as well as deliver improvements in both gross margin and operating margin percentages; and \n\n \u2022 Generated strong free cash flow of $243.1 million in 2017, enabling the Company to continue executing its capital strategy as follows: \nNet sales for the Marine Engine segment increased in 2016 when compared with 2015. The increase was mainly due to strong growth in the marine parts and accessories businesses, which included benefits from favorable market trends, market share gains, acquisitions during 2016 and 2015 and new product launches. The segment also experienced a solid increase in outboard engine net sales, driven by continued favorable retail demand trends in overall U.S. and European markets and market share gains, including benefits from recently launched products. The segment reported a decrease in sterndrive engine net sales due mostly to the continuing shift to outboards and unfavorable global retail demand trends. Acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Marine Engine segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2016. International net sales were 32 percent of the segment's net sales in 2016, and increased 4 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 5 percent in 2016, which included gains in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada, partially offset by declines in Africa and the Middle East and Latin America.\n \u2022 Fitness segment net sales reflected growth in international markets, including the impacts of the Indoor Cycling Group acquisition completed in 2016, while domestic market demand was flat; \nFor 2017, the impairment test for goodwill was a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In this second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.\n \u2022 Operating margin declined by 190 basis points when compared with the prior year, due in part to increased pension settlement charges, restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges, field campaigns charges in the Fitness segment and the impact of planned investments in growth initiatives compared with the prior year; operating margin, as adjusted, declined 40 basis points versus 2016. \nOperating earnings, Net earnings from continuing operations and Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations decreased in 2017 when compared with 2016, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The decrease in Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations was partially offset by benefits from common stock repurchases.\nCertain statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis are based on non-GAAP financial measures. GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Specifically, the discussion of the Company's cash flows includes an analysis of free cash flows and total liquidity; the discussion of the Company's net sales includes a discussion of net sales on a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions; the discussion of the Company's earnings includes a presentation of operating earnings and operating margin excluding pension settlement charges, restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges and certain product field campaigns charges; gross margin excluding certain product field campaigns charges; and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted. A non-GAAP financial measure\u201d is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and statistical measures.\nBoat segment operating earnings increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 due to higher sales and margin gains partially stemming from improved operating efficiencies, partly offset by increased restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges mostly associated with the closure of the manufacturing facility in Brazil.\nFitness segment net sales increased in 2016 when compared with 2015. Acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015 contributed 19 percentage points to the Fitness segment's revenue growth rate in 2016. Net sales also benefited from overall growth in international markets as well as modest growth in the U.S., reflecting increased sales to commercial fitness customers including the impact of declines in sales to local and federal governments. International net sales were 45 percent of the segment's net sales in 2016 and increased 19 percent compared with the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions, the segment's international net sales increased 7 percent when compared with the prior year due to strength in Asia-Pacific and Europe, partially offset by slight declines in other international markets.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles. Goodwill and other intangible assets primarily result from business acquisitions. The excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired is recorded as goodwill. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. All three of the Company's reporting units have a goodwill balance.\nThe Company operates in three operating and reportable segments: Marine Engine, Boat and Fitness. Refer to Note 6 - Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the segment operations.\n2017 vs. 2016\nChanges in foreign currency rates. Percentage changes in net sales expressed in constant currency reflect the impact that changes in currency exchange rates had on comparisons of net sales. To determine this information, net sales transacted in currencies other than U.S. dollars have been translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates that were in effect during the comparative period. The percentage change in net sales expressed on a constant currency basis better reflects the changes in the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 20 percent of the Company's annual net sales are transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's most material exposures include sales in Euros, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Brazilian reais and British pounds.\n \u2022 Through acquisitions, including the $15.5 million invested in the Marine Engine segment during 2017; \nThe following table sets forth an analysis of Total liquidity as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has executed share repurchases against authorizations approved by the Board of Directors in 2014 and 2016. In 2017, the Company repurchased $130 million of stock under these authorizations and as of December 31, 2017, the remaining authorization was $110 million. The Company plans to repurchase approximately $100 million of shares in 2018, which may be adjusted based on available cash and other investment opportunities.\nThe Company is planning for its effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 23 percent to 24 percent based on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nNet sales increased during 2016 when compared with 2015 due to increases across all segments. Marine Engine segment net sales increased due to strong growth in the marine parts and accessories businesses as well as solid growth in outboard engines. Both of these categories benefited from favorable market conditions and market share gains while sterndrive engines declined, reflecting unfavorable demand trends. Boat segment net sales increased due to strong growth rates in fiberglass outboard boats as well as solid growth rates in aluminum boats. Fitness segment net sales increased, reflecting the benefit of recent acquisitions and growth in international markets while revenues in the U.S. increased modestly. International net sales for the Company increased 10 percent in 2016 on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis when compared with 2015, driven by strong increases in European and Asia-Pacific markets, partially offset by decreases in Latin America, especially Brazil, and Africa and the Middle East.\nMatters Affecting Comparability\nAs a result, these businesses are being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. The Billiards business, which was previously reported in the former Bowling & Billiards segment, remains part of the Company and is being reported in the Fitness segment for all periods presented.\nRestructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2017, 2016 and 2015 by reportable segment are summarized below:\nThe following table sets forth certain amounts, ratios and relationships calculated from the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n \u2022 Additionally, the Marine Engine and Boat segments sales were aided by successful product launches, continued strong market share and execution of our acquisition strategy; \n (A) Gross margin is defined as Net sales less Cost of sales as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 Ended the year with $459.0 million of cash and marketable securities. \nThe aggregate funded status of the Company's qualified defined benefit pension plans, measured as a percentage of the projected benefit obligation, was approximately 80 percent at December 31, 2017 compared with approximately 78 percent at\nSee Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the impacts of the TCJA as well as a reconciliation of the Company's effective tax rate and statutory Federal income tax rate.\nNet interest expense decreased slightly in 2016 compared with 2015.\n\nBrunswick's major sources of funds for capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchase programs and dividend payments are cash generated from operating activities, available cash and marketable securities balances and potential borrowings.

The Company is targeting 5 percent to 7 percent sales growth versus 2017, which includes benefits from the continuation of solid global growth in the marine markets, the success of new products, completed acquisitions and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates. The Company anticipates sales growth in the Marine Engine segment will exceed the market due to contributions from new products as well as expanded and enhanced manufacturing and distribution capabilities. In the Boat segment, the Company expects growth in the fiberglass and aluminum outboard boat markets, including strong demand in the pontoon business. The Fitness segment is expected to report slight revenue growth resulting from the introduction of new products, enhanced digital offerings and a focus on strengthening key customer relationships.\nThe following table sets forth Marine Engine segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nResults of Operations\nQuarterly dividend payments included in the 2018 plan are consistent with current levels. However, the Company may increase these levels as earnings and cash flows improve, consistent with its capital strategy.\nOutlook for 2018\nIn 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $96.6 million and $55.1 million, respectively, of charges related to pension settlement actions as discussed in Note 17 - Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 International sales for the Company increased 10 percent in 2017 when compared with 2016 on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis due to increased sales across all international markets, especially Asia-Pacific, Europe and Canada. \nNet sales increased during 2017 when compared with 2016 due to increases across all segments. Marine Engine segment net sales increased due to strong growth in both outboard engines as well as the marine parts and accessories businesses. Outboard engines benefited from a favorable market environment, particularly for higher horsepower engines, and continued benefits from new product launches and market share gains. The marine parts and accessories businesses benefited from several factors, including\nFitness Segment\n (A) See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. \nNet cash used for investing activities of continuing operations during 2016 totaled $464.6 million, which included capital expenditures of $172.5 million. The Company's capital spending was focused on new product introductions, capacity expansion projects in all segments and other high priority, profit-enhancing projects. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaled $276.1 million. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's acquisitions.

The Company did not record any goodwill impairments in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nNet cash used for investing activities of continuing operations during 2015 totaled $68.8 million, which included capital expenditures of $114.1 million. The Company's capital spending was focused on new product introductions, capacity expansion projects in all segments, and other high priority, profit-enhancing projects. Cash paid for acquisitions totaled $29.7 million. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's acquisitions. The Company had net proceeds from marketable securities of $71.7 million in 2015. See Note 9 - Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's investments.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and the guideline public company method. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach utilizing a Gordon Growth model. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (Discount Rate) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit's forecasted performance. Fair value under the guideline public company method is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit's financial results. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit's forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts, along with selecting representative market multiples.\nSee Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\n (A) See Note 16 - Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's debt. Debt\u201d refers to future cash principal payments. Debt also includes the Company's capital leases as discussed in Note 21 - Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n2017 Cash Flow\nSee Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure related to certain legal and environmental proceedings.\nPension settlement charges. In the fourth quarters of 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $96.6 million, $55.1 million and $82.3 million of charges, respectively, related to actions taken to settle a portion of its pension obligations. These actions included transferring certain plan obligations to a third party by purchasing annuities on behalf of plan participants and making lump-sum payments directly to certain plan participants, as applicable. These costs are reflected in Pension settlement charge on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 17 - Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nbpts = basis points\nDiluted earnings from continuing operations per common share, as adjusted, increased by $0.57 per share, or 20 percent, to $3.46 per share for 2016 when compared with $2.89 per share for 2015, and included adjustments for the following items in 2016: Pension settlement charge of $0.38 per share, Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $0.10 per share and a net charge for special tax items of $0.02 per share. In 2015, Diluted earnings from continuing operations per common share included: Pension settlement charge of $0.54 per share, Restructuring, integration and impairment charges of $0.03 per share and a net benefit for special tax items of $0.13 per share.\n2016 vs. 2015\n(B) The Company defines Total liquidity as Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments in marketable securities as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, plus amounts available for borrowing under its lending facilities. Total liquidity is not intended as an alternative measure to Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments in marketable securities as determined in accordance with GAAP in the United States. The Company uses this financial measure both in presenting its results to shareholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. Management believes that this financial measure and the information it provides are useful to investors because it permits investors to view the Company's performance using the same metric that management uses to gauge progress in achieving its goals. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure Total liquidity\u201d is also useful to investors because it is an indication of the Company's available highly liquid assets and immediate sources of financing.\nThe Company expects its cash tax rate to be in the high-single digit percentage range in 2018, reflecting the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) which reduced the U.S federal statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The estimated 2018 cash tax rate also includes the impacts of an anticipated refund resulting from over-payments in 2017.\nThe Company's primary intangible assets are customer relationships and trade names acquired in business combinations. The costs of amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, typically between three and sixteen years, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. Higher royalty rates are assigned to premium brands within the marketplace based on name recognition and profitability, while other brands receive lower royalty rates. The basis for future cash flow projections are based on internal revenue forecasts by brand, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions, to which the selected royalty rate is applied. These future cash flows are discounted using the applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key uncertainties in this calculation are the selection of an appropriate royalty rate and assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth forecasts, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate.\n\nRestructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities\n2015 Cash Flow\nBoat segment net sales increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 due to growth in fiberglass outboard and aluminum boats. Net sales growth benefited from higher average selling prices, resulting from a favorable shift in mix as well as a slight increase in global wholesale unit shipments, which was slightly below global retail unit growth for the year. Additionally, net sales benefited from recently introduced new products and market share gains. An acquisition completed in 2016 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Boat segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2016. International net sales were 27 percent of the segment's net sales in 2016, a decrease of 3 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales decreased 2 percent when compared with the same prior year period, mainly due to net sales decreases in Latin America, especially Brazil, Canada and Africa and the Middle East, partially offset by increases in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.\n (B) See Note 21 - Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nThe Company recorded a $13.9 million indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment during 2017 related to the Cybex trade name. Refer to Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The Company did not record impairments for indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2016 and 2015.\nNM = not meaningful\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of net sales during 2016 when compared with 2015, mainly due to higher net sales partially offset by increases related to acquisitions and investments to support growth.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled $340.2 million. The primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expense items. An increase in working capital had a negative effect on net cash provided by operating activities. Accrued expenses decreased $31.9 million during 2015, primarily driven by a reduction in insurance reserves related to the settlement of a product liability matter that was mostly offset by a related reduction in accounts receivable reflecting the receipt of insurance proceeds, as well as a reduction in accrued payroll costs due to timing of payrolls. Accounts and notes receivable increased $11.4 million, primarily driven by higher fourth quarter sales across all segments. Net inventories increased $9.6 million due to increases in production to support higher sales volumes and new product introductions; however, increases were at a lower rate than the prior year.\nCertain statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Brunswick's business and by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Words such as may,\u201d could,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d target,\u201d plan,\u201d goal,\u201d seek,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d predict,\u201d outlook,\u201d anticipates\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations as of the date of this presentation. These risks include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and Brunswick does not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued a final standard on revenue recognition that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. Refer to Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the new revenue recognition standard which will be effective beginning January 1, 2018.\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nDuring 2017, the Company recorded restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $36.6 million compared with $15.2 million in 2016. See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nThe Company recognized equity earnings of $4.3 million and $3.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were mainly related to the Company's marine joint ventures. The Company recorded income of $3.2 million and $5.3 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in Other income, net, which includes the amortization of deferred income related to a trademark licensing agreement with AMF in both periods and unfavorable foreign exchange adjustments in 2016.\n2017 vs. 2016\nMarine Engine segment operating earnings increased in 2016 as a result of higher net sales and cost reductions, including benefits from efficiency and sourcing initiatives as well as lower commodity costs. Partially offsetting these factors were an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and growth-related investments including new product development activities.\nConsolidated\nMarine Engine Segment\n(A) The Company defines Free cash flow from continuing operations\u201d as cash flow from operating and investing activities of continuing operations (excluding cash provided by or used for acquisitions, investments, purchases or sales/maturities of marketable securities and other investing activities) and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. Free cash flow from continuing operations is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP in the United States. The Company uses this financial measure both in presenting its results to shareholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. Management believes that this financial measure and the information it provides are useful to investors because it permits investors to view Brunswick's performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving its goals. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure Free cash flow from continuing operations\u201d is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund investments in future growth initiatives.\n (D) Amounts primarily represent long-term deferred compensation plans for Company management. Payments are assumed to be equal to the remaining liability. \n \u2022 Deliver revenue growth; \nAdditionally, operating earnings comparisons were positively affected by foreign exchange rates by approximately $1 million in 2017 when compared with 2016, and were negatively affected by foreign exchange rates by approximately $14 million in 2016 when compared with 2015. These estimates include the impact of translation on all sales and costs transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, the impact of hedging activities and pricing actions in certain international markets in response to the changes in the exchange rate between the local currency and the U.S. dollar.\nThe following table sets forth Boat segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n2016 Cash Flow\n\nOn December 5, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to exit its Sea Ray businesses, including the Meridian brand, as a result of, among other things, a shift in strategic direction and a review of the expected future cash flows, market conditions and business trends. On May 22, 2015, and September 18, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its bowling products and retail bowling businesses, respectively.\nCorporate/Other\n (B) 2017 Gross margin includes $8.4 million of charges; and 2017 Operating earnings and Net earnings from continuing operations include $13.5 million of charges, respectively, for costs related to field campaigns pertaining to certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition. \nThe Company recognized equity earnings of $6.1 million and $4.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were mainly related to the Company's marine joint ventures. The Company recognized $6.1 million and $3.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, in Other income, net, which includes the amortization of deferred income related to a trademark licensing agreement with AMF Bowling Centers, Inc (AMF) in both periods, as well as favorable foreign exchange adjustments in 2017 compared with 2016. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the trademark agreement with AMF.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the realizability of net deferred tax assets and, as necessary, records valuation allowances against them. The Company estimates its tax obligations based on historical experience and current tax laws and litigation. The judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation, as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the Company's application of those laws and regulations. These factors may cause the Company's tax rate and deferred tax balances to increase or decrease. The Company's income tax provision included net charges of $71.8 million as a result of U.S. tax reform. See Note 12 - Income Taxes in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nNet interest expense decreased slightly in 2017 compared with 2016.\nNet earnings from continuing operations decreased to $187.3 million in 2017 from $272.6 million in 2016. The 2017 results include an income tax provision of $156.0 million, which included net charges of $61.8 million primarily relating to the impact of U.S. tax reform, including the impact on deferred tax balances from the reduction in the statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, along with an estimate of taxes payable on deemed unrepatriated foreign earnings. The 2016 results reflect an income tax provision of $116.4 million, which included a net income tax charge of $1.1 million, primarily associated with the impact of changes in tax laws partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments.\n (C) Purchase obligations represent agreements with suppliers and vendors at the end of 2017 for raw materials and other supplies as part of the normal course of business. \nGross margin percentage decreased in 2017 when compared with 2016 driven by declines in the Fitness segment, as a result of several factors, including higher costs, particularly product field campaigns costs for certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition as well as higher freight costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, challenging pricing dynamics in certain international markets and unfavorable changes in sales mix.\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from those estimates. If current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific matters are later determined to be inadequate, results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required. The Company has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on Brunswick's reported results.\n\nFitness segment net sales increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 due primarily to growth in international markets including benefits from the ICG acquisition. Growth in sales to value-oriented franchise clubs continues to be offset by declines in sales to traditional clubs and certain vertical markets. Acquisitions completed in 2016 accounted for 3 percentage points of growth in 2017. International net sales were 46 percent of the segment's net sales in 2017 and increased 9 percent compared with the prior year on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis due to strength across most international markets, especially Asia-Pacific and Europe, partially offset by slight declines in Canada.\n \u2022 Ended the year with a 9 percent increase in net sales when compared with 2016 on a GAAP basis and 8 percent on a constant currency basis, due to the following: \nAs a result of Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment activities, the Company anticipates future cost savings of approximately $4 million in the Fitness segment, with the full impact realized in 2018. Future cost savings will primarily be reflected in the Selling, general and administrative expense as reported on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAcquisitions. The Company completed acquisitions during 2017, 2016 and 2015 that affect the comparability of net sales. The impacts on consolidated and segment sales comparisons are reflected above. Refer to Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nRefer to Note 11 - Goodwill and Other Intangibles in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nGross margin percentage increased slightly in 2016 when compared with the same prior year period related to benefits from volume increases and cost reductions, including benefits from efficiency and sourcing initiatives as well as lower commodity costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.\nSee Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on charges and initiatives.\nThe following table sets forth Corporate/Other results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nBoat segment net sales increased in 2017 versus 2016 as a result of strong growth in the aluminum and fiberglass outboard boat businesses and growth in both domestic and international markets. Net sales benefited from increased global wholesale unit shipments as well as higher average selling prices, as customers continued to migrate to boats with more content and higher horsepower engines. An acquisition completed in 2016 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Boat segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2017. International net sales were 27 percent of the segment's net sales in 2017, an increase of 14 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 13 percent when compared with the same prior year period, mainly due to net sales increases in Canada, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.\nThe Company is planning to have higher earnings before income taxes in 2018 resulting from increased revenue and improvements in both gross margin and operating margin levels. Operating margin gains include benefits from new products, volume leverage, cost reductions related to efficiency initiatives, modestly positive product mix factors and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. The Company projects operating expenses to increase in 2018 as we continue to fund incremental investments to support growth; however, on a percentage of sales basis, they are expected to be slightly lower than 2017.\nAchievements against the Company's financial objectives in 2017 were as follows:\nFitness segment operating earnings increased slightly in 2016 when compared with the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher net sales and completed acquisitions in 2016, mostly offset by increased restructuring and integration costs, increases in growth-related investments, a net unfavorable impact of sales mix and purchase accounting adjustments related to the three acquisitions completed since 2015.\nCorporate operating expenses increased in 2017 compared with 2016 and increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to project and other growth initiative related spending, including investments in technology solutions and IT enhancements.\n__________\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company anticipates it will incur restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of approximately $3 million in 2018.\nFinancial Services\nSegments\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded restructuring, integration and impairment charges of $15.2 million compared with $4.7 million in 2015. See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\n \u2022 Enhanced shareholder returns in 2017 by repurchasing $130.0 million of common stock under the Company's share repurchase program and increased cash dividends paid to shareholders to $60.6 million. \n__________\nLegal Proceedings\nCash flows used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled $202.2 million during 2017 and included common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid to common stock shareholders.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNM = not meaningful\nNM = not meaningful\nLong-Lived Assets. The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets--excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived trade names--and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. Once an impairment indicator is identified, the Company tests for recoverability of the related asset group using an estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the remaining asset group's life. If an asset group's carrying value is not recoverable, the Company records an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over the long-lived asset group's fair value. Fair value is determined using observable inputs, including the use of appraisals from independent third parties, when available, and, when observable inputs are not available, based on the Company's assumptions of the data that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances. Specifically, the Company uses discounted cash flows to determine the fair value of the asset when observable inputs are unavailable. The Company tested its long-lived asset balances for impairment as indicators arose during 2017, 2016 or 2015, resulting in impairment charges of $0.1 million, $2.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, which are recognized in either Restructuring, integration and impairment charges or Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nEnvironmental. The Company accrues for environmental remediation-related activities for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated. Accrued amounts are generally determined in coordination with third-party experts on an undiscounted basis and do not consider recoveries from third parties until such recoveries are realized. In light of existing reserves, the Company's environmental claims, when finally resolved, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nExperience an increase in earnings before income taxes, as well as deliver improvements in both gross margin and operating margin percentages:\nThe Company includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in Management's Discussion and Analysis, as management believes that these measures and the information they provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate the Company's ongoing business performance. Brunswick does not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial measures on a GAAP basis because it is unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These items may include pension settlement charges, restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges, special tax items, charges for certain product field campaigns and certain other unusual adjustments.\n \u2022 Reported earnings before income taxes of $343.3 million in 2017 compared with earnings before income taxes of $389.0 million in 2016; adjusted earnings before income taxes were $490.0 million in 2017 versus $459.3 million in 2016; \nIn its Marine Engine segment, Brunswick continues to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with current and future emissions requirements. The Boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities. The costs associated with these activities may have an adverse effect on segment operating margins and may affect short-term operating results. Environmental regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries may impose more stringent emissions standards and/or other environmental regulatory requirements than are currently in effect. Using its environmental management system processes, the Company complies with current regulations and expects to comply fully with any new regulations; compliance will most likely increase the cost of these products for the Company and the industry, but is not expected to have a material adverse effect on Brunswick's competitive position.\nCash flows used for financing activities of continuing operations were $185.4 million during 2016 and included common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid to common stock shareholders.\nbpts = basis points\n \u2022 Continue to generate strong free cash flow and execute against the Company's capital strategy. \nPostretirement Benefit Reserves. Postretirement costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions, including the discount rate, the estimated future return on plan assets, the increase in costs of health care benefits, mortality assumptions and other factors. The Company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.\n__________\n \u2022 Strong growth in all three primary boat categories and the outboard engine business, along with solid growth in the marine parts and accessories businesses; \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nDeliver revenue growth:\nbpts = basis points\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Incentives. Brunswick's revenue is derived primarily from the sale of marine engines, marine parts and accessories, boats, fitness equipment and active recreation products. Revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale, primarily upon shipment to customers, once the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Brunswick offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotions and rebates that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated liability and reduction in revenues for sales incentives is recorded at the later of when the program has been communicated to the customer or at the time of sale. Revenues from freight are included as a part of Net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, whereas shipping, freight and handling costs are included in Cost of sales.\n\nThe Company is projecting an increase in net earnings in 2018 when compared with 2017. Net activity in working capital is projected to reflect a usage of cash in 2018 in the range of $20 million to $40 million. Additionally, the Company is planning for capital expenditures of approximately $215 million to $225 million, reflecting increased investments in capacity to support growth, continued investments in product leadership as well as our decision to increase investment as a result of cash benefits from U.S. tax reform. Including these and other factors, the Company plans to generate free cash flow in 2018 in excess of $275 million.\nThe Company recognized an income tax provision in 2016 of $116.4 million, which included a net charge of $1.1 million primarily associated with the impact of recent changes in tax law partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments. The Company recognized an income tax provision of $83.9 million in 2015, which included a net tax benefit of $12.1 million, primarily associated with the internal restructuring of foreign entities and settling prior year audits. The effective tax rate, which is calculated as the income tax benefit or provision as a percentage of pre-tax income, was 29.9 percent and 26.7 percent for 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\n2017 vs. 2016\nIn 2017, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled $417.2 million. The primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expense items. An increase in working capital had a negative effect on net cash provided by operating activities. Working capital is defined as Accounts and notes receivable, Inventories and Prepaid expenses and other, net of Accounts payable and Accrued expenses as presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets excluding the impact of acquisitions. Net inventories increased by $65.6 million to support higher sales volumes and Accounts receivable increased by $58.1 million as a result of strong sales in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these items were increases in Accrued expenses of $47.0 million and Accounts payable of $34.7 due to higher expenditure levels and timing of payments.\n\n \u2022 Gross margin declined 100 basis points when compared with 2016, driven mainly by declines in the Fitness segment due to higher costs, particularly product field campaigns costs for certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition as well as freight costs in the fourth quarter, challenging pricing dynamics in certain international markets and unfavorable changes in sales mix; gross margin, as adjusted, declined 80 basis points when compared with 2016; \nDiscontinued Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nbpts = basis points\nWarranty Reserves. The Company records an estimated liability for product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. The liability is estimated using historical warranty experience, projected claim rates and expected costs per claim. The Company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and the exposure can be estimated. The Company's warranty liabilities are affected by product failure rates as well as material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure. If actual costs differ from estimated costs, the Company must make a revision to the warranty liability.\nBoat segment operating earnings increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 as a result of higher net sales and benefits from a favorable shift in sales mix, lower commodity costs and savings related to sourcing initiatives. These factors were partially offset by increases in revenue and profit-enhancing investments.\nIncluded in the cash flow projections are contributions to the defined benefit pension plans of approximately $70 million to $75 million in 2018. These amounts may be adjusted for several factors, including actions to accelerate our de-risking activities, increasing contributions to generate higher deductions at a more favorable statutory rate as a result of U.S. tax reform, market conditions, pension funding regulations and Company discretion. The Company contributed $70.0 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans both in 2017 and 2016. The Company also contributed $3.7 million and $4.6 million to fund benefit payments from its nonqualified defined benefit pension plan in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSee Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the recent accounting pronouncements that have been adopted during the year ended December 31, 2017, or will be adopted in future periods.\n (A) See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.  (B) Operating earnings includes a $13.5 million charge for costs related to field campaigns pertaining to certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition.\nSelling, general and administrative expense and Research and development expense line items increased during 2017 when compared with 2016, but decreased as a percentage of net sales. Both line items reflected increased funding to support investments in new products and growth initiatives, partially offset by cost reduction efforts.\nContractual Obligations\n\nthe successful execution of the Company's international growth strategy, recent acquisitions and new product launches. Boat segment net sales reflected strong growth in the aluminum and fiberglass outboard boat businesses. Fitness segment net sales increased modestly reflecting growth in international markets while domestic demand was flat. International net sales for the Company increased 10 percent in 2017 on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis when compared with 2016, driven by strong sales increases in Asia-Pacific, Europe and Canada as well as solid increases in other international markets.\nMarine Engine segment operating earnings increased in 2017 as a result of higher net sales and favorable changes in product mix, partially offset by planned increases in growth investments in advance of new product introductions and the resolution of litigation in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n2016 vs. 2015\nTax items. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $156.0 million, which included net charges of $61.8 million, primarily relating to the impact of U.S. tax reform under the TCJA, including the unfavorable impact on deferred tax balances caused by the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, along with an estimate of taxes payable on deemed unrepatriated foreign earnings. The 2016 results reflect an income tax provision of $116.4 million, which included a net income tax charge of $1.1 million, primarily associated with the impact of changes in tax laws partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments.\n__________\nRefer to Note 10 - Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Company's financial services.\nGuarantees. The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with guarantees and repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. Historical cash requirements and losses associated with these obligations have not been significant. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these arrangements.\nThe Company's effective tax rate in both periods also reflects the benefit of having earnings from foreign entities in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. This includes entities in Hungary, China, Poland and the United Kingdom which have applicable statutory tax rates of 9 percent, 15 percent, 19 percent and 19 percent, respectively.\n (A) See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. \nProduct field campaigns charge. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $13.5 million charge for costs related to field campaigns pertaining to certain Cybex products designed prior to the acquisition. The charge consisted of $8.4 million and $5.1 million within Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. There were no comparable costs in the prior year periods. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies for further details.\nManagement believes that the Company has adequate sources of liquidity to meet the Company's short-term and long-term needs. The next significant long-term debt maturity is not until 2021.\nGeneral\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $156.0 million, which included net charges of $61.8 million primarily relating to the impact of U.S. tax reform, including the unfavorable impact on deferred tax balances caused by the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, along with an estimate of taxes payable on deemed unrepatriated foreign earnings. The 2016 results reflect an income tax provision of $116.4 million, which included a net income tax charge of $1.1 million, primarily associated with the impact of changes in tax laws partially offset by the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments. The effective tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 45.4 percent and 29.9 percent, respectively.\nThe Company's results for all periods presented, as discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis, are presented on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted. Refer to Note 2 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nCertain events occurred during 2017, 2016 and 2015 that the Company believes affect the comparability of the results of operations. The table below summarizes the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the impact of recent acquisitions on the Company's net sales:\n(A) In June 2016, the Company amended and restated its existing credit agreement, dated as of March 2011, as amended and restated as of June 2014. See Note 16 - Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's lending facility.\nCash Flow, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 Funded investments in growth: \nThe following table sets forth a summary of the Company's contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nMarine Engine segment net sales increased in 2017 versus 2016 due to strong growth in both outboard engines and the marine parts and accessories businesses. Outboard engines benefited from a favorable market environment, particularly for higher horsepower engines, and continued benefits from market share gains, including benefits from recently launched products. The marine parts and accessories businesses benefited from the successful execution of the Company's international growth strategy, recent acquisitions and new product launches. Partially offsetting these factors was a decrease in sterndrive engine net sales due to the continuing shift to outboards which is contributing to unfavorable global retail demand trends. Acquisitions completed in 2017 and 2016 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Marine Engine segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2017. International net sales were 30 percent of the segment's net sales in 2017, and increased 10 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 9 percent in 2017, which included gains in all international markets, with the strongest increases in Canada, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nBoat Segment\nDiluted earnings from continuing operations per common share, as adjusted, increased by $0.43 per share, or 12 percent, to $3.89 per share for 2017 when compared with $3.46 per share for 2016, and included adjustments for the following items in 2017: a net charge for special tax items of $0.76 per share, Pension settlement charge of $0.69 per share, Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $0.26 per share and product field campaigns charges of $0.10 per share. In 2016, Diluted earnings from continuing operations per common share included: Pension settlement charge of $0.38 per share, Restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $0.10 per share and a net charge for special tax items of $0.02 per share.\nIn 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $55.1 million and $82.3 million, respectively, of charges related to pension settlement payments as discussed in Note 17 - Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company views its highly liquid assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 as:\nDecember 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's qualified defined benefit pension plans were underfunded on an aggregate projected benefit obligation basis by $137.6 million which represented a $61.5 million improvement from 2016. This improvement was due to strong asset returns and contributions of $70 million, which more than outpaced the impact of interest on plan liabilities. See Note 17 - Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\nOverview and Outlook\nLitigation. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to claims and litigation, including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company accrues for litigation based upon its assessment, made in consultation with counsel, of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim. In light of existing reserves, the Company's litigation claims, when finally resolved, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRestructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges. During 2017, the Company recorded restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges of $36.6 million, compared with charges of $15.2 million in 2016 and $4.7 million in 2015. See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\n2017 vs. 2016\nAdditionally, as a result of the TCJA, specifically the imposition of a one-time deemed repatriation tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the Company reevaluated its indefinite assertion as of December 31, 2017. The Company is considering remitting cash back to the U.S. in 2018 from non-U.S. subsidiaries and as such, the Company will no longer assert that it is permanently reinvested in any non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. These remittances would be considered dividends and under changes made by the TCJA these dividends would be subject to a 100 percent dividend received deduction and would not result in any U.S. federal tax liability. The Company is continuing to analyze the effects of the TCJA including the impact on future repatriations and any related withholding taxes from non-U.S. subsidiaries. Future repatriations could result in additional funds to execute the Company's capital strategy.\n \u2022 The Marine Engine and Boat segments benefited from strong global market demand, as domestic markets continued to grow and international markets benefited from gains in Europe, Canada and Asia-Pacific, as well as improving conditions in other regions; \nThe following table sets forth Fitness segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nOperating earnings, Net earnings from continuing operations and Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased in 2016 when compared with 2015, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs. Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations also benefited from the impact of common stock repurchases.\nThe Company's 2017 results represent the eighth consecutive year of growth, primarily resulting from strong operating performance from our marine businesses. The Company looked to achieve the following financial objectives in 2017:\n (E) Other long-term liabilities include amounts recorded as secured obligations for lease and other long-term receivables originated by the Company and assigned to third parties where the transfer of assets do not meet the conditions for a sale as a result of the Company's contingent obligation to repurchase the receivables in the event of customer non-payment. Amounts above also include obligations under deferred revenue arrangements and future projected payments related to the Company's nonqualified pension plans. The Company is not required to make any contributions to the qualified pension plan in 2017; however, $3.7 million of scheduled retiree health care and life insurance benefit plan payments due within one year are included in other long-term liabilities. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential future cash outflows associated with these plans, the Company is unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amounts and periods in which any additional liabilities might be paid beyond 2017. \n2016 vs. 2015\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $449.6 million as of December 31, 2017, a decrease of $8.6 million from $458.2 million as of December 31, 2016. Total debt as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $437.4 million and $439.4 million, respectively. The Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio improved to 22.8 percent as of December 31, 2017, from 23.4 percent as of December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used for investing activities of continuing operations during 2017 totaled $165.2 million, which included capital expenditures of $189.3 million. The Company's capital spending was focused on new product introductions, capacity expansion and other profit enhancing projects in all segments. Cash paid for the acquisition of Lankhorst Taselaar, net of cash acquired, was $15.5 million. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's acquisitions. Net cash used for investing activities also included $35.0 million of maturities of marketable securities and Proceeds from the sale of Property, plant and equipment of $8.3 million. See Note 9 - Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's investments.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled $423.5 million. The primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expense items. An increase in working capital had a negative effect on net cash provided by operating activities. Net inventories increased by $40.4 million due to increases in production to support higher sales volumes. Accrued expenses decreased $17.3 million which included the impact of the payments of deferred compensation in connection with executive management transitions. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in Accounts payable of $34.8 million, which was partially due to the timing of payments.\n2016 vs. 2015\nCash flows used for financing activities of continuing operations were $175.5 million during 2015 and included common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid to common stock shareholders.\n \u2022 Increase earnings before income taxes, as well as deliver improvements in both gross margin and operating margin percentages; and \n\n \u2022 Generated strong free cash flow of $243.1 million in 2017, enabling the Company to continue executing its capital strategy as follows: \nNet sales for the Marine Engine segment increased in 2016 when compared with 2015. The increase was mainly due to strong growth in the marine parts and accessories businesses, which included benefits from favorable market trends, market share gains, acquisitions during 2016 and 2015 and new product launches. The segment also experienced a solid increase in outboard engine net sales, driven by continued favorable retail demand trends in overall U.S. and European markets and market share gains, including benefits from recently launched products. The segment reported a decrease in sterndrive engine net sales due mostly to the continuing shift to outboards and unfavorable global retail demand trends. Acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015 accounted for 1 percentage point of the Marine Engine segment's overall revenue growth rate in 2016. International net sales were 32 percent of the segment's net sales in 2016, and increased 4 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 5 percent in 2016, which included gains in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada, partially offset by declines in Africa and the Middle East and Latin America.\n \u2022 Fitness segment net sales reflected growth in international markets, including the impacts of the Indoor Cycling Group acquisition completed in 2016, while domestic market demand was flat; \nFor 2017, the impairment test for goodwill was a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In this second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.\n \u2022 Operating margin declined by 190 basis points when compared with the prior year, due in part to increased pension settlement charges, restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges, field campaigns charges in the Fitness segment and the impact of planned investments in growth initiatives compared with the prior year; operating margin, as adjusted, declined 40 basis points versus 2016. \nOperating earnings, Net earnings from continuing operations and Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations decreased in 2017 when compared with 2016, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The decrease in Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations was partially offset by benefits from common stock repurchases.\nCertain statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis are based on non-GAAP financial measures. GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Specifically, the discussion of the Company's cash flows includes an analysis of free cash flows and total liquidity; the discussion of the Company's net sales includes a discussion of net sales on a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions; the discussion of the Company's earnings includes a presentation of operating earnings and operating margin excluding pension settlement charges, restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges and certain product field campaigns charges; gross margin excluding certain product field campaigns charges; and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted. A non-GAAP financial measure\u201d is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and statistical measures.\nBoat segment operating earnings increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 due to higher sales and margin gains partially stemming from improved operating efficiencies, partly offset by increased restructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges mostly associated with the closure of the manufacturing facility in Brazil.\nFitness segment net sales increased in 2016 when compared with 2015. Acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015 contributed 19 percentage points to the Fitness segment's revenue growth rate in 2016. Net sales also benefited from overall growth in international markets as well as modest growth in the U.S., reflecting increased sales to commercial fitness customers including the impact of declines in sales to local and federal governments. International net sales were 45 percent of the segment's net sales in 2016 and increased 19 percent compared with the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions, the segment's international net sales increased 7 percent when compared with the prior year due to strength in Asia-Pacific and Europe, partially offset by slight declines in other international markets.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles. Goodwill and other intangible assets primarily result from business acquisitions. The excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired is recorded as goodwill. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. All three of the Company's reporting units have a goodwill balance.\nThe Company operates in three operating and reportable segments: Marine Engine, Boat and Fitness. Refer to Note 6 - Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the segment operations.\n2017 vs. 2016\nChanges in foreign currency rates. Percentage changes in net sales expressed in constant currency reflect the impact that changes in currency exchange rates had on comparisons of net sales. To determine this information, net sales transacted in currencies other than U.S. dollars have been translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates that were in effect during the comparative period. The percentage change in net sales expressed on a constant currency basis better reflects the changes in the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 20 percent of the Company's annual net sales are transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's most material exposures include sales in Euros, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Brazilian reais and British pounds.\n \u2022 Through acquisitions, including the $15.5 million invested in the Marine Engine segment during 2017; \nThe following table sets forth an analysis of Total liquidity as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has executed share repurchases against authorizations approved by the Board of Directors in 2014 and 2016. In 2017, the Company repurchased $130 million of stock under these authorizations and as of December 31, 2017, the remaining authorization was $110 million. The Company plans to repurchase approximately $100 million of shares in 2018, which may be adjusted based on available cash and other investment opportunities.\nThe Company is planning for its effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 23 percent to 24 percent based on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nNet sales increased during 2016 when compared with 2015 due to increases across all segments. Marine Engine segment net sales increased due to strong growth in the marine parts and accessories businesses as well as solid growth in outboard engines. Both of these categories benefited from favorable market conditions and market share gains while sterndrive engines declined, reflecting unfavorable demand trends. Boat segment net sales increased due to strong growth rates in fiberglass outboard boats as well as solid growth rates in aluminum boats. Fitness segment net sales increased, reflecting the benefit of recent acquisitions and growth in international markets while revenues in the U.S. increased modestly. International net sales for the Company increased 10 percent in 2016 on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis when compared with 2015, driven by strong increases in European and Asia-Pacific markets, partially offset by decreases in Latin America, especially Brazil, and Africa and the Middle East.\nMatters Affecting Comparability\nAs a result, these businesses are being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. The Billiards business, which was previously reported in the former Bowling & Billiards segment, remains part of the Company and is being reported in the Fitness segment for all periods presented.\nRestructuring, exit, integration and impairment charges recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2017, 2016 and 2015 by reportable segment are summarized below:\nThe following table sets forth certain amounts, ratios and relationships calculated from the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n \u2022 Additionally, the Marine Engine and Boat segments sales were aided by successful product launches, continued strong market share and execution of our acquisition strategy; \n (A) Gross margin is defined as Net sales less Cost of sales as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 Ended the year with $459.0 million of cash and marketable securities. \nThe aggregate funded status of the Company's qualified defined benefit pension plans, measured as a percentage of the projected benefit obligation, was approximately 80 percent at December 31, 2017 compared with approximately 78 percent at\nSee Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the impacts of the TCJA as well as a reconciliation of the Company's effective tax rate and statutory Federal income tax rate.\nNet interest expense decreased slightly in 2016 compared with 2015.\n\nBrunswick's major sources of funds for capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchase programs and dividend payments are cash generated from operating activities, available cash and marketable securities balances and potential borrowings. The Company evaluates potential acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures in the ordinary course of business.\n \u2022 Contributed $73.7 million to the Company's qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans; and \n\nEnvironmental Regulation\nThe Company is projecting 2018 to be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth with improved free cash flow generation. The Company is targeting 5 percent to 7 percent sales growth versus 2017, which includes benefits from the continuation of solid global growth in the marine markets, the success of new products, completed acquisitions and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates. The Company anticipates sales growth in the Marine Engine segment will exceed the market due to contributions from new products as well as expanded and enhanced manufacturing and distribution capabilities. In the Boat segment, the Company expects growth in the fiberglass and aluminum outboard boat markets, including strong demand in the pontoon business. The Fitness segment is expected to report slight revenue growth resulting from the introduction of new products, enhanced digital offerings and a focus on strengthening key customer relationships.\nThe following table sets forth Marine Engine segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nResults of Operations\nQuarterly dividend payments included in the 2018 plan are consistent with current levels. However, the Company may increase these levels as earnings and cash flows improve, consistent with its capital strategy.\nOutlook for 2018\nIn 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $96.6 million and $55.1 million, respectively, of charges related to pension settlement actions as discussed in Note 17 - Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 International sales for the Company increased 10 percent in 2017 when compared with 2016 on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis due to increased sales across all international markets, especially Asia-Pacific, Europe and Canada. \nNet sales increased during 2017 when compared with 2016 due to increases across all segments. Marine Engine segment net sales increased due to strong growth in both outboard engines as well as the marine parts and accessories businesses. Outboard engines benefited from a favorable market environment, particularly for higher horsepower engines, and continued benefits from new product launches and market share gains. The marine parts and accessories businesses benefited from several factors, including\nFitness Segment\n (A) See Note 3 - Restructuring, Exit, Integration and Impairment Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. \nNet cash used for investing activities of continuing operations during 2016 totaled $464.6 million, which included capital expenditures of $172.5 million. The Company's capital spending was focused on new product introductions, capacity expansion projects in all segments and other high priority, profit-enhancing projects. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaled $276.1 million. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's acquisitions. Additionally, the Company had net purchases of marketable securities of $24.3 million during the year.
