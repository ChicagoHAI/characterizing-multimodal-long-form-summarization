Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nREV is a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of specialty vehicles and related aftermarket parts and services. We provide customized vehicle solutions for applications including: essential needs (ambulances, fire apparatus, school buses, mobility vans and municipal transit buses), industrial and commercial (terminal trucks, cut-away buses and street sweepers) and consumer leisure (recreational vehicles RVs\u201d and luxury buses). Our brand portfolio consists of 29 well-established principal vehicle brands including many of the most recognizable names within our served markets. Several of our brands pioneered their specialty vehicle product categories and date back more than 50 years. We believe that in most of our markets, we hold the first or second market share position and approximately 63% of our net sales during fiscal year 2017 came from products where we believe we hold such share positions.\nIn fiscal year 2017, our net sales were $2,267.8 million, which were $341.8 million, or 17.7%, greater than fiscal year 2016. This increase in net sales was due to increases in our Fire & Emergency and Recreation segments. In fiscal year 2018 we expect sales in our Fire & Emergency segment to increase at a rate slightly better than the sales percent increase for the overall company due to increased unit volume, as a result of the full year impact of the Ferrara Fire Apparatus ( Ferrara\u201d) acquisition, and strong end-market demand across both our fire and ambulance product lines. In our Commercial segment for fiscal year 2018, we expect net sales to increase at a rate below the net sales percent increase for the entire company. In our Recreation segment, we expect net sales to increase in fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017 at a rate better than the net sales percent increase for the overall company as a result of higher unit sales volume in both Class A and Class C RV units due to end market demand growth, continued growth in market share across both RV classes and as a result of the Renegade and Midwest Automotive Designs ( Midwest\u201d) acquisitions.\nGross profit and gross margin percentage were $294.6 million and 13.0%, respectively, in fiscal year 2017, which were $64.7 million and 105 basis points higher than in fiscal year 2016. These improvements in gross profit and gross margin percentage were due to realized benefits from higher sales (including parts), our ongoing materials sourcing initiatives, a more profitable mix of sales in our Fire & Emergency segment, lower cost of quality and strategic pricing actions.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses in fiscal year 2017 were $188.3 million which is an increase of $48.5 million compared to fiscal year 2016. This increase was primarily due to additional SG&A expenses from acquired companies and higher stock compensation expense related to our IPO.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $14.9 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to $9.4 million in fiscal year 2016. The increase in amortization expenses was due to the amortization of the intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of Renegade in December 2016, the acquisitions of Ferrara and Midwest in April 2017 and the acquisition of KME in April 2016. As a result of these acquisitions, the Company estimates future amortization expense for intangible assets to approximate $12.0 million in fiscal year 2018. This anticipated amortization expense may be adjusted in future periods pending the final completion of the detailed valuation of intangible assets acquired as a result of fiscal year 2017 acquisitions.\nInterest expense was $20.7 million in fiscal year 2017, which is a decrease of $8.4 million compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The decrease in interest expense was due to the impact of debt reduction from our IPO and our debt refinancing in April 2017.\nNet income was $31.4 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to net income of $30.2 million in fiscal year 2016. Adjusted Net Income in fiscal year 2017 was $75.9 million, which is a 42.7% increase over $53.2 million in fiscal year 2016.\nDiluted net income per common share was $0.50 in fiscal year 2017 compared to $0.58 in fiscal year 2016. Adjusted diluted net income per common share was $1.22 per share in fiscal year 2017, which is a 18.4% increase from $1.03 in fiscal year 2016 even with a greater number of weighted average shares outstanding in fiscal year 2017. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income is included in the section -Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\u201d below.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $162.5 million fiscal year 2017, an increase of $39.7 million or 32.3%, from $122.8 million in fiscal year 2016. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of acquisitions and higher net sales and gross profit from certain business segments described above. A detailed reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is included in the section -Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\u201d below.\nCapital expenditures were $54.0 million in fiscal year 2017, and were primarily comprised of expenditures for manufacturing facility equipment and improvements, new product tooling, our ongoing ERP system implementation, and the continued rollout of our online parts sales infrastructure.\nSegments\nWe serve a diversified customer base primarily in the United States through the following segments:\nFire & Emergency - The Fire & Emergency segment sells fire apparatus equipment under the Emergency One ( E-ONE\u201d), Kovatch Mobile Equipment ( KME\u201d) and Ferrara brands and ambulances under the American Emergency Vehicles ( AEV\u201d), Horton Emergency Vehicles ( Horton\u201d), Leader Emergency Vehicles ( Leader\u201d), Marque, McCoy Miller, Road Rescue, Wheeled Coach and Frontline brands. We believe we are the largest manufacturer by unit volume of fire and emergency vehicles in the United States and have one of the industry's broadest portfolios of products including Type I ambulances (aluminum body mounted on a heavy truck-style chassis), Type II ambulances (van conversion ambulance typically favored for non-emergency patient transportation), Type III ambulances (aluminum body mounted on a van-style chassis), pumpers (fire apparatus on a custom or commercial chassis with a water pump and small tank to extinguish fires), ladder trucks (fire apparatus with stainless steel or aluminum ladders), tanker trucks and rescue and other vehicles. Each of our individual brands is distinctly positioned and targets certain price and feature points in the market such that dealers often carry and customers often buy more than one REV Fire & Emergency product line. In April 2017, we acquired Ferrara Fire Apparatus, a leader in custom fire apparatus and rescue vehicles.\nCommercial - Our Commercial segment serves the bus market through the following principal brands: Collins Bus, Goshen Coach, ENC, ElDorado National, Krystal Coach, Federal Coach, Champion and World Trans. We serve the terminal truck market through the Capacity brand, the sweeper market through the Lay-Mor brand and the mobility van market through our recently recast Revability brand. We are a leading producer of small- and medium-sized buses, Type A school buses, transit buses, terminal trucks and street sweepers in the United States. Our products in the Commercial segment include cut-away buses (customized body built on various types and sizes of commercial chassis), transit buses (large municipal buses where we build our own chassis and body), luxury buses (bus-style limo or high-end luxury conversions), street sweepers (three- and four-wheel versions used in road construction activities), terminal trucks (specialized vehicle which moves freight in warehouses or intermodal yards and ports), Type A school buses (small school bus built on commercial chassis), and mobility vans (mini-van converted to be utilized by wheelchair passengers). Within each market segment, we produce a large number of customized configurations to address the diverse needs of our customers.\nRecreation - Our Recreation segment serves the RV market through six principal brands: American Coach, Fleetwood RV, Monaco Coach, Holiday Rambler, Renegade and Midwest. We believe our brand portfolio contains some of the longest standing, most recognized brands in the RV industry. Under these six brands, REV provides a variety of highly recognized models such as: American Eagle, Dynasty, Discovery, Bounder and Pace Arrow, among others. Our products in the Recreation segment include Class A motorized RVs (motorhomes built on a heavy duty chassis with either diesel or gas engine configurations), Class C and Super C\u201d motorized RVs (motorhomes built on a commercial truck or van chassis), a line of heavy-duty special application trailers, and, as a result of the acquisition of Midwest, Class B RVs (motorhomes built out on a van chassis). The Recreation segment also includes Goldshield Fiberglass, which produces a wide range of custom molded fiberglass products for the RV and broader industrial markets. In December 2016, we acquired Renegade RV, a leader in the Super C\u201d segment of the RV market and producer of a line of heavy-duty special application trailers. In April 2017, we acquired Midwest, a leading producer of Class B RVs and custom luxury vans.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nThe primary factors affecting our results of operations include:\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nOur business is impacted by the U.S. economic environment, employment levels, consumer confidence, municipal spending, changes in interest rates and instability in securities markets around the world, among other factors. In particular, changes in the U.S. economic climate can impact demand in key end markets.\nRV purchases are discretionary in nature and therefore sensitive to the availability of financing, consumer confidence, unemployment levels, levels of disposable income and changing levels of consumer home equity, among other factors. The 2008 recession caused consumers to reduce their discretionary spending, which negatively affected sales volumes for RVs. Terminal truck sales volumes are also impacted by economic conditions and industrial output, as these factors impact our end-market customers for these products, which include shipping ports, trucking/distribution hubs and rail terminal operators. Although RV and terminal truck sales have increased in recent years, these markets are affected by general U.S. and global economic conditions, which create risks that future economic downturns will further reduce consumer demand and negatively impact our sales.\nWhile less economically sensitive than the Recreation segment and our terminal truck business, our Fire & Emergency segment and the remainder of the Commercial segment are also impacted by the overall economic environment. Local tax revenues are an important source of funding for fire and emergency response departments. Reduced municipal tax revenues resulting from the 2008 recession led to a decline in these markets. As fire and emergency products and buses are typically a larger cost item for municipalities and their service life is relatively long, their purchase is more deferrable, which can result in reduced demand for our products.\nA decrease in employment levels, consumer confidence or the availability of financing, or other adverse economic events, or the failure of actual demand for our products to meet our estimates, could negatively affect the demand for our products. Any decline in overall customer demand in markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance.\nCost Management Initiatives\nOur recent operating results reflect the impact of our ongoing initiatives to lower our operating costs to expand our profit margins. Purchased materials, including chassis, represent our largest component of costs of sales. We operate a centralized strategic procurement organization dedicated to reducing our overall level of materials spend across our three segments, while simplifying and standardizing suppliers and parts. Reduction in our cost of quality is also a major enterprise-wide focus. We share best practices and manage improvement initiatives from a central operations team as well as at the individual business unit level.\nImpact of Acquisitions\nFor the past several years, a significant component of our growth has been the addition of businesses or business units through acquisitions. We typically incur upfront costs as we integrate acquired businesses and implement our operating philosophy at newly acquired companies, including consolidation of supplies and materials, changes to production processes at acquired facilities to implement manufacturing improvements and other restructuring initiatives. The benefits of these integration efforts may not positively impact our financial results until subsequent periods. Operational and financial integration of our recently acquired businesses could be ongoing.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we recognize acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. This includes the recognition of identified intangible assets and goodwill which, in the case of definite-life intangible assets, are then amortized over their expected useful lives, which typically results in an increase in amortization expense. In addition, assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally include tangible assets, as well as contingent assets and liabilities.\nImpact of Initial Public Offering\nPrior to our IPO, our stockholders were party to a shareholders agreement that was amended and restated in its entirety as a result of the IPO. That previous shareholders agreement provided for, among other things, an employee stockholder to sell their stock back to the Company when he or she is terminated by the Company without cause or for good reason, death, disability, retirement or dissolution. This provision required us to recognize the value of these outstanding shares as temporary equity in our consolidated balance sheet, with changes in the fair value recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. The aforementioned rights of the employee stockholder to sell his or her shares of common stock lapsed upon completion of our IPO and, at that time, those outstanding shares which were held by an employee were reclassified to shareholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the IPO, the fair value of our common stock held by employees subject to the previous shareholders agreement was $35.4 million, which was reclassified to additional paid in capital on the Company's consolidated balance sheet on the IPO date.\nStock Compensation Expense\nAs a result of our IPO, outstanding stock options which had previously been recorded as a liability on the Company's balance sheet were reclassified to permanent equity. On the date of the IPO, vesting of 846,000 of these liability awards were accelerated, and there were 1,528,000 of vested liability option awards. All liability option awards were re-measured at fair value based upon the IPO offering price of $22.00 per share. Also as a result of the IPO, the Company recorded stock compensation expense of $13.3 million due to the change in fair value of the liability option awards and $8.9 million due to stock options which immediately vested.\nKey Performance Indicators\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of operational and financial measures. These measures include net sales, units sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income. In assessing segment performance, our chief executive officer, as the chief operating decision maker, analyzes the primary financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA.\nNet Sales and Units Sold\nWe evaluate net sales and units sold because it helps us measure the impact of economic trends, the effectiveness of our marketing, the response of customers to new product launches and model changes, and the effect of competition over a given period. We recognize revenue for sales of completed vehicles upon shipment or delivery and acceptance by the dealer or customer as specified by the relevant dealer or customer purchase order.\nOur units represent a wide range of products at various price points, with higher value-added units at higher price points typically resulting in higher gross margins. Additionally, large orders of similar units typically provide operational efficiencies that contribute to higher gross margins. As such, our management also utilizes unit volume sales mix to analyze the performance of our business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nWe evaluate our selling, general and administrative expenses in order to identify areas where we can further invest or create cost savings. Such investments or spending reductions could include items such as third-party services and cost of administrative processes. These expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, sales and marketing expenses, as well as other expenses associated with facilities unrelated to our manufacturing and supply chain network, internal management expenses and expenses for finance, information systems, legal, business development, human resources, purchasing and other administrative functions.\nThe components of our selling, general and administrative expenses may not be identical to those of our competitors. As a result, data in this document regarding our operating and administrative expenses may not be comparable to similar expenses of our competitors. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as we grow our businesses and due to additional legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses we expect to incur as a result of being a public company.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are the primary metrics we use to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our markets. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are useful performance measures and we use them to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, we also utilize the metric of Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales as a complimentary measurement of performance among our businesses and versus our competitors. We also use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income as primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain compensation programs and plans for employees, including our senior executives.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP, nor are they measures of financial condition or liquidity and they should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or net income, respectively, for the period determined in accordance with GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nTable

</tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Consolidated net sales were $2,267.8 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $341.8 million, or 17.7%, from $1,926.0 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in consolidated net sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales of $216.0 million and $181.8 million in the Fire & Emergency and Recreation segments, respectively, offset by a decrease in net sales of $58.9 million in the Commercial segment. The increase in Fire & Emergency segment net sales were due to $151.9 million of incremental net sales from acquired companies, higher ambulance and fire apparatus unit volumes, and higher average selling prices for both fire trucks and ambulances. The increase in net sales in the Recreation segment was primarily due to higher unit sales volumes of Class A and Class C vehicles, and $112.6 million of incremental net sales from acquired companies. The decrease in Commercial segment net sales was primarily due to lower shuttle bus unit volume compared to the prior year. Excluding net sales from acquired companies, net sales in fiscal year 2017 increased $76.3 million or 4.0% compared to the prior year.\nCost of Sales. Consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 87.0% for fiscal year 2017 as compared to 88.1% for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in consolidated cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily due to net reductions in the costs of materials resulting from specific sourcing initiatives, lower cost of quality, and the benefits of higher production volumes. In addition, cost of sales in fiscal year 2017 were lower as a percent of net sales due to strategic pricing initiatives for certain vehicle classes.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit was $294.6 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $64.7 million, or 28.1% from $229.9 million for fiscal year 2016. Consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 13.0% and 11.9% for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively. The 105 basis points increase in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was due to the combination of higher net sales and lower cost of sales described above, as well as higher aftermarket parts sales volume in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were $188.3 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $48.5 million, or 34.7%, from $139.8 million for fiscal year 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 8.3% and 7.3% for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to expenses from acquired companies, increased stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO and higher employee payroll and benefit costs compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2017 included $26.6 million of stock-based compensation expense. Fiscal year 2017 stock-based compensation expense is made up of $13.3 million for the remeasurement of liability awards to our IPO share price, $8.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of liability awards and stock options resulting from the completion of our IPO and $3.3 million related to the redemption of performance-based stock options.\nResearch and Development. Consolidated research and development costs were $4.2 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 12.4% from $4.8 million for fiscal year 2016.\nDue to the customized nature of many of our products and customer contracts, other costs for new product development are incurred and realized as a component of cost of sales.\nRestructuring. Consolidated restructuring costs were $4.5 million for fiscal year 2017, compared to $3.5 million in fiscal year 2016. Restructuring costs in fiscal year 2017 represent costs incurred to restructure some of the Company's management functions in the Commercial segment and in our Corporate office, which consisted of personnel costs, including severance and other employee benefit payments. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a plan to relocate production of Goshen Coach buses from its Elkhart, Indiana facility to its facilities in Salina, Kansas and Imlay City, Michigan and the relocation of our mobility van production facility from Salina, Kansas to Longview, Texas.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Consolidated amortization of intangible assets was $14.9 million for fiscal year 2017, compared to $9.4 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in amortization expense was due to the amortization of the intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of KME in April 2016, Renegade in December 2016 and Midwest and Ferrara in April 2017.\nInterest Expense. Consolidated interest expense was $20.7 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 28.8% from $29.2 million for fiscal year 2016, respectively. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the repayment of our Notes in February 2017 with net proceeds from our IPO and the impact of our debt refinancing in April 2017.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $11.9 million for fiscal year 2017, which includes losses recognized upon the redemption of our Notes in February 2017 and our April 2017 re-financing. The Company paid a prepayment premium of $7.7 million and wrote off $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and $0.4 million of original issue discount resulting from the redemption of our Notes. Loss on early extinguishment of debt also includes the write-off of $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of our debt re-financing in April 2017.\nIncome Taxes. Consolidated income tax expense was $18.7 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $5.6 million from $13.1 million expense for fiscal year 2016. The effective income tax rate was 37.3% and 30.2% for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively. The increase in the Company's effective income tax rate, relative to the prior fiscal year, relates primarily to a prior year beneficial adjustment to deferred income tax balances.\nNet Income. Consolidated net income was $31.4 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $1.2 million, or 3.9% from net income of $30.2 million for fiscal year 2016.\nAdjusted Net Income. Consolidated Adjusted net income in fiscal year 2017 was $75.9 million, which is a 42.7% increase over $53.2 million in fiscal year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $162.5 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $39.7 million, or 32.3%, from $122.8 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, resulting from higher net sales, lower manufacturing costs and the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased 19.1% for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016.\nFire & Emergency Segment\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 984,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 768,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 215,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales.

Net sales of fire apparatus increased $176.9 million due primarily to sales from acquired companies and increased fire apparatus and ambulance units sold in our legacy businesses. In fiscal year 2017, we had incremental net sales of $151.9 million from KME and Ferrara, which were acquired in April 2016 and April 2017. Net sales of ambulance units increased $39.1 million compared to the prior year due to an increased mix of higher content vehicles and an increase in units sold.

Fire & Emergency segment Adjusted EBITDA was $109.5 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $24.3 million, or 28.5%, from $85.2 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased net sales from KME and Ferrara, mix shift toward higher content fire apparatus and modular ambulance vehicles, and operational improvements, including lower material costs and manufacturing cost reductions, and strategic pricing initiatives. These Adjusted EBITDA increases were partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from acquired companies. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Fire & Emergency segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 21.0% compared to the prior year.\nCommercial Segment\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 620,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 679,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (58,904\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,874\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales.

Commercial segment Adjusted EBITDA was $50.5 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 5.4%, from $53.4 million for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to reduced shuttle bus unit volume compared to the prior year, which was offset by lower material costs, increased average realized pricing, and a shift in sales mix toward transit buses and terminal trucks as a percentage of total segment sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Commercial segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.8% compared to the prior year.\nRecreation Segment\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 659,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 478,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 181,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 229.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Recreation segment net sales were $659.8 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $181.8 million, or 38.0%, from $478.1 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in net sales was due to an increase in organic unit volume and average selling prices as well as the impact of acquired companies. The increase in organic unit volume was due to an increase in both Class A and Class C units sold for fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior year. The increase in average selling prices was due to an improved mix of sales, compared to the prior year, as well as strategic pricing initiatives. Net sales from acquired companies were $112.6 million for fiscal year 2017. Excluding the impact of net sales from acquired companies, Recreation segment net sales increased 14.5% compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA.

The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in gross profit offset partially by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in gross profit was due to higher unit sales volumes, lower cost of materials, lower cost of quality as a percentage of sales, higher average selling prices resulting from product mix, and the impact of acquired companies. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to expenses from acquired companies.

Consolidated net sales were $1,926.0 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $190.9 million, or 11.0%, from $1,735.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in consolidated net sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales of $147.9 million and $65.1 million in the Fire & Emergency and Recreation segments, respectively, offset by a decrease in net sales of $22.9 million in the Commercial segment. Increases in Fire & Emergency segment net sales were due to higher fire apparatus volumes, $97.2 million of net sales from KME, which was acquired in April 2016, and higher average selling prices for both fire apparatus and ambulances. Higher net sales in the Recreation segment were due to higher unit sales volumes primarily in its Class A diesel products. Lower Commercial segment net sales were primarily due to lower shuttle bus units shipped during fiscal year 2016.\nCost of Sales. Consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 88.1% for fiscal year 2016 as compared to 89.5% for fiscal year 2015. The decrease in consolidated cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily due to a decrease in cost of sales in the Fire & Emergency and Commercial segments, offset by an increase in cost of sales in the Recreation segment. The aggregate reduction in cost of sales for the Company was due to the enterprise-wide implementation of strategic price increases, net reductions in the costs of materials resulting from specific sourcing initiatives, and the benefits of higher unit sales volumes.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit was $229.9 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $48.0 million, or 26.4% from $182.0 million for fiscal year 2015. Consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 11.9% and 10.5% for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The increase in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was due to the combination of higher net sales and lower cost of sales described above.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were $139.8 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $37.5 million, or 36.6%, from $102.3 million for fiscal year 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 7.3% and 5.9% for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increased corporate and marketing expenses. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2016 included $19.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, of which $10.3 million pertains to the acceleration and repurchase of outstanding options from former employees and $6.5 million pertains to the remeasurement of outstanding liability awards to fair value, which were required to be recorded at fair value as a result of becoming a public entity after the filing of our Form S-1 with the SEC.\nResearch and Development. Consolidated research and development costs for fiscal year 2016 were $4.8 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 5.7% from $5.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The reduction was largely due to the timing and mix of product development programs and testing, with higher spending in fiscal year 2015 for a fully redesigned terminal truck that was introduced to the market in 2015 and for the development of new RV models introduced in 2015 and 2016.\nRestructuring. Consolidated restructuring costs were $3.5 million for fiscal year 2016, compared to $3.9 million in fiscal year 2015. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a plan to relocate production of Goshen Coach buses from its Elkhart, Indiana facility to its facilities in Salina, Kansas and Imlay City, Michigan and the relocation of our mobility van production from Salina, Kansas to Longview, Texas.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Consolidated amortization of intangible assets was $9.4 million for fiscal year 2016, compared to $8.6 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in amortization expenses was due primarily to the amortization of the additional intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of KME in April 2016.\nInterest Expense. Consolidated interest expense was $29.2 million and $27.3 million for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The increase in consolidated interest expense was due primarily to additional interest expense from our revolving credit facility, which was primarily due to higher borrowings for capital expenditures and business acquisitions compared to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes. Consolidated income tax expense was $13.1 million in fiscal year 2016, an increase of $1.1 million compared to $11.9 million in fiscal year 2015. The effective income tax rate was 30.2% and 34.3% for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The decrease in the Company's effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2016, relative to the prior fiscal year, related primarily to a discrete adjustment to deferred income tax balances. The adjustment was not material to the Company's current or previously issued financial statements.\nNet Income. Consolidated net income was $30.2 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $7.3 million, or 32.0% from $22.9 million for fiscal year 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $122.8 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $32.7 million, or 36.3%, from $90.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, offset partially by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAdjusted Net Income. Consolidated Adjusted Net Income was $53.2 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $19.2 million, or 56.3% from $34.0 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted Net Income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, offset partially by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFire & Emergency Segment\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 768,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 620,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales.

Net sales of fire apparatus increased $134.1 million compared to the prior year, due primarily to net sales of $97.2 million from KME, which was acquired in April 2016, net sales of $38.3 million from the acquisition of certain assets and assumed liabilities of Hall-Mark Fire Apparatus Inc. ( Hall-Mark\u201d and the Hall-Mark Acquisition\u201d) in November 2015, and a larger mix of higher content units from our legacy fire business. Net sales of ambulance units increased $13.8 million compared to the prior year due primarily to sales mix of higher content units, offset by lower unit volume. In addition, net sales across all Fire & Emergency products increased due to the implementation of strategic price increases for certain models and markets.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Fire & Emergency segment Adjusted EBITDA was $85.2 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $21.9 million, or 34.5%, from $63.3 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased average realized pricing, procurement initiatives and other operational improvements, as well as increased net sales from the acquired KME and the Hall-Mark businesses, which was partially offset by reduced units shipped compared to the prior year and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCommercial Segment\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 679,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 701,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,947\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales.

The increase in net sales was due primarily to an increase in Class A diesel and Class C units sold compared to the prior year due to greater end market demand and lower net sales from the intentional slowdown in production in the prior year. This was partially offset by fewer units sold of Class A gas models compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Recreation segment Adjusted EBITDA was $11.0 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $9.5 million, or 630.3%, from $1.5 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in unit volume, benefits from procurement initiatives and lower sales discounting, partially offset by the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales due to product mix and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents orders received from dealers or directly from end customers.

The following table presents a summary of our backlog by segment (in thousands):\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fire & Emergency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 590,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 550,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 366,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 226,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recreation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 144,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate & Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,101,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 857,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 244,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEach of our three segments has a backlog of new vehicle orders that generally extends out from two to twelve months in duration. Our businesses take orders from our dealers and end customers that are evidenced by a firm purchase order for delivery of one or many specialty vehicles and parts with a given specification over a period of time. These firm orders are placed in our backlog and reported at the aggregate selling prices, net of discounts or allowances, at the time the purchase order is received. We do not include verbal commitments or promised orders in our reported backlog. For fiscal year 2017, our backlog was $1,101.6 million compared to $857.3 million in fiscal year 2016. The increase in Fire & Emergency and Recreation backlogs were partially due to the current year acquisitions of Ferrara, Renegade and Midwest. In addition, our Commercial segment backlog at October 31, 2017 includes a portion of a large transit bus order that is expected to begin delivering in early fiscal year 2019. We expect that\napproximately $183.0 million of our current backlog will not be produced and sold within the next 12 months following October 31, 2017.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for each of the quarters in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods in accordance with GAAP. This data should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for a full year or any future period.\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter

At October 31, 2017, a balance of $0.6 million of the restructuring costs remained unpaid. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a strategic plan to relocate production of Goshen buses to its Salina, KS and Imlay City, MI facilities. The Company recognized $3.0 million of costs associated with the relocation, including but not limited to personnel costs, severance and bonuses in fiscal year 2017, and $0.7 million of such costs were recognized in fiscal year 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Company recognized $2.8 million of costs associated with this re-organization and office relocation, which included severance, lease termination and other associated expenses.\nThe nature and amount of such restructuring costs vary significantly based on the number of completed acquisitions and the size and timing of related and other restructuring programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items are useful to investors by supplementing the GAAP information with an additional measure that can be used to assess the Company's operating performance.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> (d)\n</td> <td> Reflects expenses associated with stock-based compensation.

For the fiscal year 2016, stock-based compensation expense included $10.3 million related to the redemption of performance based stock options. For fiscal year 2016, stock-based compensation expense included $10.3 million for the accelerated vesting of stock options held by former employees, which were subsequently redeemed for cash. Approximately $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for fiscal year 2016 related to the non-cash remeasurement of outstanding liability awards to fair value. The remeasurement of the liability awards was required as a result of the Company becoming a public entity after the filing with the SEC in connection with its IPO. The remaining stock-based compensation expense of $2.9 million for fiscal year 2016 was a non-cash charge for stock options vesting on their normal vesting schedule that were not repurchased by us as described above. We do not expect that such accelerated vesting, the remeasurement of outstanding liability awards and repurchase of outstanding stock options will be an ongoing cost following our IPO. For this reason, we expect substantially all of our future stock-based compensation expense to be a non-cash expense that follows a normal vesting schedule.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> (e)\n</td> <td> Reflects the amortization of the difference between the fair market and book value of certain acquired inventory which was sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> (f)\n</td> <td> Includes prepayment premiums and write-offs of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount recognized upon the redemption of our Notes in February 2017, as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the Company's previous revolving credit facility as a result of the Company's ABL refinancing in April 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, inventory management, acquiring machinery and equipment, acquiring and building manufacturing facilities, the improvement and expansion of existing manufacturing facilities, debt service payments, regular quarterly dividend payments, and general corporate needs. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.\nWe believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy, cash dividends and additional expenses we expect to incur as a public company. However, we cannot assure you that our cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the April 2017 ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and if availability under the April 2017 ABL Facility is not sufficient due to the size of our borrowing base or other external factors, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nWorking capital at October 31, 2017 (defined as current assets (excluding cash) minus current liabilities (excluding current portion of long-term debt) was $299.7 million compared to $187.3 million at October 29, 2016. The increase in working capital was primarily due to incremental working capital from companies acquired in the current year, as well as an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior year fourth quarter, and a corresponding increase in inventory to support an anticipated growth in sales.\nLong-term debt, excluding current maturities, at October 31, 2017 was $229.1 million compared to $256.0 million at October 29, 2016. Long-term debt decreased primarily due to the use of net proceeds from our IPO to redeem our Notes and partially pay down the outstanding balance on our revolving credit, offset by the increase in working capital described above, increased borrowings to fund the acquisitions of Renegade, Midwest and Ferrara and capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017.\nCash Flow\nThe following table shows summary cash flows for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (229,102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84,430\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,617\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 202,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,573\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,551\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2017 was $33.2 million, compared to $75.6 million for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in cash from operating activities for fiscal year 2017, compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in inventory, higher cash outflows for other liabilities and lower incoming customer advance payments, which was partially offset by an increase in current year income from operations and faster current year collections of accounts receivable.\nThe higher cash outflows for other liabilities in fiscal year 2017, compared to the prior year was partially due to higher management incentive bonus payments made in the first quarter of the current year versus the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 related to the prior year performance. Also, cash outflows were higher due to the timing of income tax payments, which were $5.5 million greater in fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior year. The increase in inventory was due to increased sales volumes and the timing of vehicle production.\nExcluding stock-based compensation expense, operating income increased by $17.2 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2016 was $75.6 million compared to $25.6 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase in cash provided by activities was due to an increase in operating income in fiscal year 2016 as well as increased cash flows for accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by reduced cash flows for accounts receivable and inventories. Operating income increased $10.3 million, which was due to higher gross margin offset by increased corporate and marketing expenses. The increase in cash flows for accounts payable was due to timing of vendor payments. The increase in cash outflows for other liabilities was due to the timing of payments for payroll and related benefits and incentive compensation and income tax payments, as the Company's accruals for these expenses at the end of fiscal year 2016 were $20.5 million higher than the prior year. The reduced cash flows for accounts receivable was primarily due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, which were $81.7 million higher than the comparable prior year period, and timing of customer payments. The increase in inventory was due primarily to a higher backlog, which increased $154.4 million compared to the prior year.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2017 of $229.1 million was primarily due to business acquisition activity and capital expenditures. In fiscal year 2017, the Company completed the acquisitions of Renegade, Midwest and Ferrara.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2016 was $84.4 million, which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $48.5 million and $31.7 million of payments for the acquisition of KME.\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2015 was $15.6 million, which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $15.4 million.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2017 was $202.9 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from our IPO offset by the use of those proceeds to redeem our Notes, and further net borrowings from the April 2017 ABL Facility and Term Loan to support acquisitions and working capital requirements.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, the Company paid cash dividends of $6.4 million.\nOn December 19, 2017, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share on our common stock, payable in respect of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The dividend is payable on February 28, 2018 to holders of record as of January 28, 2018. Subject to legally available funds and the discretion of our board of directors, we expect to pay a quarterly cash dividend at the rate of $0.05 per share on our common stock. We expect to pay this quarterly dividend on or about the last day of the first month following each fiscal quarter to shareholders of record on the last day of such fiscal quarter. Our dividend policy has certain risks and limitations, particularly with respect to liquidity, and we may not pay dividends according to our policy, or at all. We cannot assure you that we will declare dividends or have sufficient funds to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2016 was $14.7 million, which primarily consisted of net borrowings from our previous ABL facility, offset partially by $21.7 million of payments to redeem common stock and common stock options and the repayment of debt assumed in the Hall-Mark Acquisition.\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2015 was $17.6 million, which primarily consisted of net repayments of our revolving credit facility and payments to redeem common stock and common stock options, offset partially by the net proceeds from sales of our common stock.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for fiscal year 2018, excluding any acquisitions, are estimated to be approximately $50 to $55 million.\nOffering of Common Stock\nOn January 26, 2017, the Company announced an IPO of its common stock which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol REVG.\u201d On February 1, 2017, the Company completed the offering of 12,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $22.00 per share and the Company received approximately $275.0 million in gross proceeds from the IPO, or approximately $253.6 million in net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and expenses related to the IPO. The net proceeds of the IPO were used to redeem the entire outstanding balance of its Notes, including a prepayment premium and accrued interest, and partially pay down the then outstanding balance of its revolving credit facility.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOn February 16, 2017, we redeemed in full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes ( Notes\u201d) with a portion of the proceeds from the IPO. The Company paid a prepayment premium of $7.7 million and accrued interest of $4.5 million as of the redemption date.\nTerm Loan\nOn April 25, 2017, the Company entered into a $75.0 million term loan ( Term Loan\u201d or Term Loan Agreement\u201d), as Borrower, with certain subsidiaries of the Company as Guarantor Subsidiaries. Principal may be prepaid at any time during the term of the Term Loan without penalty. The Company incurred $2.0 million in debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan. The Term Loan Agreement expires on April 25, 2022.\nApril 2017 ABL Facility\nOn April 25, 2017, the Company entered into a new $350.0 million ABL revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the April 2017 ABL Facility\u201d). The April 2017 ABL Facility provides for revolving loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $350.0 million. The total April 2017 ABL Facility is subject to a $30.0 million sublimit for swing line loans and a $35.0 million sublimit for letters of credit, along with certain borrowing base and other customary restrictions as defined in the April 2017 ABL Agreement. The April 2017 ABL Facility expires on April 25, 2022.\nFunds from the April 2017 ABL Facility were used to repay borrowings on the previous ABL Facility and to fund the Ferrara acquisition.\nPrincipal may be repaid at any time during the term of the April 2017 ABL Facility without penalty.\nThe April 2017 ABL Facility contains certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the ABL Facility as of October 31, 2017.\nOctober 2013 ABL Facility\nOn October 21, 2013, we entered into a $150.0 million senior secured asset based lending revolving credit and guaranty agreement (the Asset Based Lending ABL\u201d or the ABL Facility\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders. On April 22, 2016, we exercised our $50.0 million incremental commitment option under the ABL Facility in conjunction with the acquisition of KME. On August 19, 2016, we amended the ABL Facility to increase the commitment from $200.0 million to $300.0 million to provide flexibility and access to the suppressed borrowing base. All other terms and conditions of the ABL Facility remained unchanged.\nIn February 2017, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from its IPO to repay loans under the ABL Facility.\nIn April 2017, the Company repaid all outstanding loans and obligations under the ABL Facility in full, and the ABL Facility was terminated.\nContractual Obligations\nThe below table of material debt and lease commitments at October 31, 2017 summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods as set forth in the table below.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 228,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchasing obligations(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total commitments(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 233,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 284,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Includes estimated principal payments due under our Term Loan and the April 2017 ABL Facility as of October 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Based on interest rates in effect as of October 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> (c)\n</td> <td> Includes obligations under non-cancellable purchase orders for raw materials or chassis as of October 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> (d)\n</td> <td> Unrecognized tax benefits totaling $2.6 million as of October 31, 2017, excluding related interests and penalties, are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income for the relevant period before depreciation and amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes, as adjusted for certain items described below that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income, as adjusted for certain items described below that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor Adjusted Net Income is a measure defined by GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income is net income for the relevant period.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are useful to investors and are used by our management for measuring profitability because these measures exclude the impact of certain items which we believe have less bearing on our core operating performance because they are items that are not needed or available to the Company's managers in the daily activities of their businesses. We believe that the core operations of our business are those which can be affected by our management in a particular period through their resource allocation decisions that affect the underlying performance of our specialty vehicle operations conducted during that period. We also believe that decisions utilizing Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income allow for a more meaningful comparison of operating fundamentals between companies within our markets by eliminating the impact of capital structure and taxation differences between the companies. To determine Adjusted EBITDA, we further adjust net income for the following items: non-cash depreciation and amortization, interest expense and benefit for income taxes. Stock-based compensation expense is excluded from both Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA because it is an expense that is measured based upon external inputs such as our current share price and the movement of share price of peer companies, which cannot be impacted by our business managers. Stock-based compensation expense also reflects a cost which may obscure trends in our underlying vehicle businesses for a given period, due to the timing and nature of the equity awards.\nWe also adjust for exceptional items which are determined to be those that in management's judgment need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, which include non-cash items and items settled in cash. In determining whether an event or transaction is exceptional, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence. This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to our Board of Directors, assists in providing a meaningful analysis of our operating performance and used as a measurement in incentive compensation for management. Based on the foregoing factors, management considers the adjustment for non-cash purchase accounting to be an exceptional item.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as analytical tools. These are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP, nor are they measures of financial condition and they should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net loss for the period determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, such measures do not reflect:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, excluding interest expense; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cash requirements to pay our taxes and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, excluding income tax expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction expenses(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sponsor expenses(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash purchase accounting expense(e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on early extinguishment of debt(f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Reflects costs incurred in connection with business acquisitions and offerings of our common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Reflects the reimbursement of expenses to AIP, the Company's primary equity holder.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> (c)\n</td> <td> In fiscal year 2017, the Company restructured some of its management functions in its Commercial segment and in its Corporate office and incurred personnel costs, including severance and other employee benefit payments of approximately $1.5 million.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a plan to relocate production of Goshen Coach buses from its Elkhart, Indiana facility to its facilities in Salina, Kansas and Imlay City, Michigan and the relocation of our mobility van production from Salina, Kansas to Longview, Texas. Additionally, costs incurred in the current year quarter consisted of personnel costs, including severance, vacation and other employee benefit payments.\nThe nature and amount of such restructuring costs vary significantly based on the number of completed acquisitions and the size and timing of related and other restructuring programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items are useful to investors by supplementing the GAAP information with an additional measure that can be used to assess the Company's operating performance.\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> (d)\n</td> <td> Reflects expenses associated with stock-based compensation.

For fiscal year 2016, stock-based compensation expense includes $10.3 million related to the redemption of performance based stock options. We do not expect that such accelerated vesting, the remeasurement of outstanding liability awards and repurchase of outstanding stock options will be an ongoing cost following completion our IPO.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a plan to relocate production of Goshen Coach buses from its Elkhart, Indiana facility to its facilities in Salina, Kansas and Imlay City, Michigan and the relocation of our mobility van production from Salina, Kansas to Longview, Texas. Additionally, costs incurred in the current year quarter consisted of personnel costs, including severance, vacation and other employee benefit payments.\nThe nature and amount of such restructuring costs vary significantly based on the number of completed acquisitions and the size and timing of related and other restructuring programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items are useful to investors by supplementing the GAAP information with an additional measure that can be used to assess the Company's operating performance.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> (d)\n</td> <td> Reflects expenses associated with stock-based compensation.

Approximately $6.5 million of stock-based compensation for fiscal year 2016 related to the non-cash remeasurement of outstanding liability awards to fair value. The remeasurement of the liability awards was required as a result of the Company becoming a public entity after the filing of its Form S-1 with the SEC.

With the exception of operating lease obligations, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures and capital resources. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nSeasonality\nIn a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically the slowest quarters have been the first and second fiscal quarters when the purchasing seasons for vehicles such as school buses, RVs and sweepers are the lowest due to the colder weather and the relatively long time until summer vacation season, and the school year is underway with municipalities and school bus contractors utilizing their existing fleets to transport student populations. Sales of our products have typically been higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters (with the fourth fiscal quarter typically being the strongest) due to better weather, the vacation season, buying habits of RV dealers and end-users, timing of government/municipal customer fiscal years, and the beginning of a new school year. Sales and earnings for other vehicles that we produce, such as essential emergency vehicles and commercial bus fleets, are less seasonal, but fluctuations in sales of these vehicles can also be impacted by timing surrounding the fiscal years of municipalities and commercial customers, as well as the timing and amounts of multi-unit larger orders. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-Some of the markets in which we compete are seasonal, which results in fluctuations in sales and results of operations.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our consolidated financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, future results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue for sales of vehicles, parts and other finished products when contract terms are met, collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer. In certain instances, risk of ownership and title passes when the product has been completed in accordance with purchase order specifications and has been tendered for delivery to the customer. Periodically, certain customers request bill and hold transactions. In those cases, revenue recognition for vehicles occurs after the customer has been notified that the products have been completed according to the customer specifications, have passed all of our quality control inspections, and are ready for delivery.\nRevenue from service agreements is recognized as earned when services are rendered. Intercompany sales are eliminated upon consolidation. Provisions are made for discounts, returns and sales allowances based on management's best estimate and the historical experience of each business unit. Sales are recorded net of amounts invoiced for taxes imposed on the customer, such as excise or value-added taxes.\nCustomer advances include amounts received in advance of the completion of vehicles or in advance of services being rendered. Such customer advances are recorded as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet until the vehicle is shipped or the service rendered.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the guidance of Accounting Standard Codification 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for which utilization is not more likely than not. Management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, expirations due to statutes, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual.\nStock Compensation Expense\nStock compensation expense is recorded over the agreed upon vesting term of the associated stock option grants, and is measured based upon the estimation of the fair value of all stock option awards on the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model (the Black-Scholes Model\u201d). The application of the Black-Scholes Model requires us to make certain assumptions such as the fair value of our common stock on the grant date, forfeitures of option grants and the rate of dividend payments on our common stock. Other assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes Model include volatility of the share price of select peer public companies and the risk free rate.\nPrior to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock was calculated by determining our enterprise value by applying an earnings multiple to our Adjusted EBITDA over the previous 12 months, and deducting outstanding debt, then dividing by the number of shares of common stock outstanding. The assumption for forfeitures is based upon historical experience. As we have not historically paid dividends on our common stock, we have previously assumed a 0% dividend rate for all outstanding stock options.\nPrior to our IPO, our stockholders were party to a shareholders agreement that was amended and restated in its entirety. Due to provisions in that shareholders agreement, employee shareholders were allowed to put his or her shares to us under certain circumstances. As such, certain outstanding stock options were considered liability awards and were recorded at fair value and recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. As a result of our IPO, the aforementioned put rights expired and the outstanding options were no longer considered liability awards and the fair value of the options have been reclassified to additional paid-in capital.\nStock compensation expense for restricted and performance stock awards is recorded over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The grant date fair value is equal to the closing share price on the date of grant.\nBusiness Combinations\nAcquisitions are accounted for using purchase accounting. The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business, in each case based on their estimated fair values. Any excess consideration transferred is recorded as goodwill. A bargain purchase gain is recognized to the extent the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase price. The results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition.\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed generally include tangible and intangible assets, as well as contingent assets and liabilities. When available, the estimated fair values of these assets and liabilities are determined based on observable inputs, such as quoted market prices, information from comparable transactions, offers made by other prospective acquirers (in such cases where we may have certain rights to acquire additional interests in existing investments) and the replacement cost of assets in the same condition or stage of usefulness (Level 1 and 2). Unobservable inputs, such as expected future cash flows or internally developed estimates of value (Level 3), are used if observable inputs are not available.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts billed and currently due from customers. We extend credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments. Management determines the allowance for uncollectible accounts by evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer's financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. Each fiscal quarter, we prepare an analysis of our ability to collect outstanding receivables that provides a basis for an allowance estimate for uncollectible accounts. In connection with this analysis, we evaluate the age of accounts receivable, past collection history, current financial conditions of key customers and economic conditions.\nBased on this evaluation, we establish a reserve for specific accounts receivable that are believed to be uncollectible, as well as an estimate of uncollectible receivables not specifically known. Historical trends and our current knowledge of potential collection problems provide us with sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for an allowance for uncollectible accounts. Receivables are written off when management determines collection is highly unlikely and collection efforts have ceased. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company accounts for business combinations by estimating the fair value of consideration paid for acquired businesses, including contingent consideration, and assigning that amount to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the remainder assigned to goodwill. If the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the fair value of consideration paid, a gain on bargain purchase is recognized. The estimates of fair values are determined utilizing customary valuation procedures and techniques, which require us, among other things, to estimate future cash flows and discount rates. Such analyses involve significant judgments and estimations.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of trade names, are not amortized, however, the Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that its carrying amount may not exceed its fair value. The annual impairment review is performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year based upon information and estimates available at that time. To perform the impairment testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of the Company's reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts as a basis for determining whether or not to perform the quantitative impairment test. Qualitative testing includes the evaluation of economic conditions, financial performance and other factors such as key events when they occur. The Company then estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and each indefinite-lived intangible asset not meeting the qualitative criteria and compares their fair values to their carrying values.\nUnder the quantitative method, the fair value of each reporting unit of the Company is determined by using the income approach and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The income approach involves discounting management's projections of future cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a discount rate which approximates the Company's weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d). Key assumptions used in the income approach include future sales growth, gross margin and operating expenses trends, depreciation expense, taxes, capital expenditures and changes in working capital. Projected future cash flows are based on income forecasts and management's knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. The WACC incorporates equity and debt return rates observed in the market for a group of comparable public companies in the industry, and is determined using an average debt to equity ratio of selected comparable public companies, and is also adjusted for risk premiums and the Company's capital structure. The terminal value is based upon the projected cash flow for the final projected year, and is calculated using estimates of growth of the net cash flows based on the Company's estimate of stable growth for each financial reporting unit. The inputs and assumptions used in the determination of fair value are considered Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\nIf the fair value of any reporting unit, as calculated using the income approach, is less than its carrying value, the fair value of the implied goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill. An impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value for each reporting unit.\nThe Company has applied the qualitative method for its fiscal 2017 impairment test.\nWhen determining the fair value of indefinite-lived trade names, the Company uses the relief from royalty method which requires the determination of fair value based on if the Company was licensing the right to the trade name in exchange for a royalty fee. The Company utilizes the income approach to determine future revenues to which to apply a royalty rate. The royalty rate is based on research of industry and market data related to transactions involving the licensing of comparable intangible assets. In considering the value of trade names, the Company looks to relative age, consistent use, quality, expansion possibilities, relative profitability and relative market potential.\nLong-Lived Assets, Including Definite-Lived Intangibles\nProperty, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an analysis is necessitated by the occurrence of a triggering event, we compare the carrying amount of the asset group with the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group with its estimated fair value. Such analyses necessarily involve significant judgments and estimations on our part.\nWarranty\nProvisions for estimated warranty and other related costs are recorded in cost of sales and are periodically adjusted to reflect actual experience. The amount of accrued warranty liability reflects management's best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring our obligations under our limited warranty plans. The costs of fulfilling our warranty obligations principally involve replacement parts, labor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit or recall campaigns. Our estimates are based on historical experience, the number of units involved and the cost per claim. Also, each quarter we review actual warranty claims to determine if there are systemic effects that would require a field retrofit or recall campaign.\nSegment Reporting\nFor purposes of business segment performance measurement, we do not allocate to individual business segments costs or items that are of a non-operating nature or organizational or functional expenses of a corporate nature. The caption Corporate and Other\u201d includes corporate office expenses, including stock-based compensation, results of insignificant operations, intersegment eliminations and income and expenses not allocated to reportable segments. Identifiable assets of the business segments exclude general corporate assets, which principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, certain property, plant and equipment and certain other assets pertaining to corporate and other centralized activities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. This standard will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. Under the new standard, entities are required to identify the contract with a customer, identify the separate performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract and recognize the appropriate amount of revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies each performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (the Company's fiscal year 2019). We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\u201d ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). Under ASU 2015-11, entities should measure inventory that is not measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method, including inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out or average cost, at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company's fiscal year 2018), and is to be applied prospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements\u201d ( ASU 2015-15\u201d), which clarifies the guidance set forth in ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), issued in April 2015. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. ASU 2015-15 provides additional guidance regarding debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, stating that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-03 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 (the Company's fiscal year 2017), and early adoption was permitted. In fiscal year 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 and debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability for all periods presented. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 did not have a material effect our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805)-Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\u201d ( ASU 2015-16\u201d). ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer in a business combination recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, rather than as retrospective adjustments. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 (the Company's fiscal year 2017), including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2015-16 was applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of ASU 2015-16 with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\u201d ( ASU 2015-17\u201d), which simplifies the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the classified balance sheet, rather than separating such deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We prospectively adopted ASU 2015-17 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and therefore prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The amendments in this update require, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of leases with a duration of less than 12 months) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We expect to adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)\u201d ( ASU 2016-09\u201d), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for the related income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company's fiscal year 2018), including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 to our consolidated financial statements is dependent upon the Company's share price, income tax rates and the timing of stock option exercises.", "item_7_truncated": "Selling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were $188.3 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $48.5 million, or 34.7%, from $139.8 million for fiscal year 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 8.3% and 7.3% for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to expenses from acquired companies, increased stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO and higher employee payroll and benefit costs compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2017 included $26.6 million of stock-based compensation expense. Fiscal year 2017 stock-based compensation expense is made up of $13.3 million for the remeasurement of liability awards to our IPO share price, $8.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of liability awards and stock options resulting from the completion of our IPO and $3.3 million related to the redemption of performance-based stock options.\nNet Sales. Recreation segment net sales were $659.8 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $181.8 million, or 38.0%, from $478.1 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in net sales was due to an increase in organic unit volume and average selling prices as well as the impact of acquired companies. The increase in organic unit volume was due to an increase in both Class A and Class C units sold for fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior year. The increase in average selling prices was due to an improved mix of sales, compared to the prior year, as well as strategic pricing initiatives. Net sales from acquired companies were $112.6 million for fiscal year 2017. Excluding the impact of net sales from acquired companies, Recreation segment net sales increased 14.5% compared to the prior year.\nDue to the customized nature of many of our products and customer contracts, other costs for new product development are incurred and realized as a component of cost of sales.\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 768,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 620,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Recreation segment net sales were $478.1 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $65.1 million, or 15.8%, from $412.9 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in net sales was due primarily to an increase in Class A diesel and Class C units sold compared to the prior year due to greater end market demand and lower net sales from the intentional slowdown in production in the prior year. This was partially offset by fewer units sold of Class A gas models compared to the prior year.\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>

The increase in working capital was primarily due to incremental working capital from companies acquired in the current year, as well as an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior year fourth quarter, and a corresponding increase in inventory to support an anticipated growth in sales.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 659,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 478,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 181,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 229.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA.

The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, expirations due to statutes, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (229,102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84,430\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,617\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 202,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,573\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,551\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Income.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $122.8 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $32.7 million, or 36.3%, from $90.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, offset partially by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are useful to investors and are used by our management for measuring profitability because these measures exclude the impact of certain items which we believe have less bearing on our core operating performance because they are items that are not needed or available to the Company's managers in the daily activities of their businesses. We believe that the core operations of our business are those which can be affected by our management in a particular period through their resource allocation decisions that affect the underlying performance of our specialty vehicle operations conducted during that period. We also believe that decisions utilizing Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income allow for a more meaningful comparison of operating fundamentals between companies within our markets by eliminating the impact of capital structure and taxation differences between the companies. To determine Adjusted EBITDA, we further adjust net income for the following items: non-cash depreciation and amortization, interest expense and benefit for income taxes. Stock-based compensation expense is excluded from both Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA because it is an expense that is measured based upon external inputs such as our current share price and the movement of share price of peer companies, which cannot be impacted by our business managers. Stock-based compensation expense also reflects a cost which may obscure trends in our underlying vehicle businesses for a given period, due to the timing and nature of the equity awards.\nRecreation - Our Recreation segment serves the RV market through six principal brands: American Coach, Fleetwood RV, Monaco Coach, Holiday Rambler, Renegade and Midwest. We believe our brand portfolio contains some of the longest standing, most recognized brands in the RV industry. Under these six brands, REV provides a variety of highly recognized models such as: American Eagle, Dynasty, Discovery, Bounder and Pace Arrow, among others. Our products in the Recreation segment include Class A motorized RVs (motorhomes built on a heavy duty chassis with either diesel or gas engine configurations), Class C and Super C\u201d motorized RVs (motorhomes built on a commercial truck or van chassis), a line of heavy-duty special application trailers, and, as a result of the acquisition of Midwest, Class B RVs (motorhomes built out on a van chassis). The Recreation segment also includes Goldshield Fiberglass, which produces a wide range of custom molded fiberglass products for the RV and broader industrial markets. In December 2016, we acquired Renegade RV, a leader in the Super C\u201d segment of the RV market and producer of a line of heavy-duty special application trailers. In April 2017, we acquired Midwest, a leading producer of Class B RVs and custom luxury vans.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fire & Emergency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 590,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 550,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 366,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 226,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recreation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 144,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate & Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,101,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 857,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 244,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands):\nSenior Secured Notes\nImpact of Acquisitions\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 679,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 701,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,947\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (f) Reflects losses recognized upon the redemption of our Notes in February 2017.

The loss on early extinguishment of debt also includes the write-off of $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of our debt re-financing in April 2017. \nIncome Taxes. Consolidated income tax expense was $18.7 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $5.6 million from $13.1 million expense for fiscal year 2016. The effective income tax rate was 37.3% and 30.2% for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively. The increase in the Company's effective income tax rate, relative to the prior fiscal year, relates primarily to a prior year beneficial adjustment to deferred income tax balances.\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 984,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 768,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 215,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nResearch and Development. Consolidated research and development costs for fiscal year 2016 were $4.8 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 5.7% from $5.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The reduction was largely due to the timing and mix of product development programs and testing, with higher spending in fiscal year 2015 for a fully redesigned terminal truck that was introduced to the market in 2015 and for the development of new RV models introduced in 2015 and 2016.\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 478,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 412,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 630.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit was $294.6 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $64.7 million, or 28.1% from $229.9 million for fiscal year 2016. Consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 13.0% and 11.9% for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively. The 105 basis points increase in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was due to the combination of higher net sales and lower cost of sales described above, as well as higher aftermarket parts sales volume in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016.\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 228,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchasing obligations(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total commitments(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 233,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 284,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \nNet Sales. Consolidated net sales were $2,267.8 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $341.8 million, or 17.7%, from $1,926.0 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in consolidated net sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales of $216.0 million and $181.8 million in the Fire & Emergency and Recreation segments, respectively, offset by a decrease in net sales of $58.9 million in the Commercial segment. The increase in Fire & Emergency segment net sales were due to $151.9 million of incremental net sales from acquired companies, higher ambulance and fire apparatus unit volumes, and higher average selling prices for both fire trucks and ambulances. The increase in net sales in the Recreation segment was primarily due to higher unit sales volumes of Class A and Class C vehicles, and $112.6 million of incremental net sales from acquired companies. The decrease in Commercial segment net sales was primarily due to lower shuttle bus unit volume compared to the prior year. Excluding net sales from acquired companies, net sales in fiscal year 2017 increased $76.3 million or 4.0% compared to the prior year.\nOn January 26, 2017, the Company announced an IPO of its common stock which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol REVG.\u201d On February 1, 2017, the Company completed the offering of 12,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $22.00 per share and the Company received approximately $275.0 million in gross proceeds from the IPO, or approximately $253.6 million in net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and expenses related to the IPO. The net proceeds of the IPO were used to redeem the entire outstanding balance of its Notes, including a prepayment premium and accrued interest, and partially pay down the then outstanding balance of its revolving credit facility.\nAdjusted Net Income. Consolidated Adjusted Net Income was $53.2 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $19.2 million, or 56.3% from $34.0 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted Net Income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, offset partially by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe Company has applied the qualitative method for its fiscal 2017 impairment test.\nIncome Taxes. Consolidated income tax expense was $13.1 million in fiscal year 2016, an increase of $1.1 million compared to $11.9 million in fiscal year 2015. The effective income tax rate was 30.2% and 34.3% for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The decrease in the Company's effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2016, relative to the prior fiscal year, related primarily to a discrete adjustment to deferred income tax balances. The adjustment was not material to the Company's current or previously issued financial statements.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $14.9 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to $9.4 million in fiscal year 2016. The increase in amortization expenses was due to the amortization of the intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of Renegade in December 2016, the acquisitions of Ferrara and Midwest in April 2017 and the acquisition of KME in April 2016. As a result of these acquisitions, the Company estimates future amortization expense for intangible assets to approximate $12.0 million in fiscal year 2018. This anticipated amortization expense may be adjusted in future periods pending the final completion of the detailed valuation of intangible assets acquired as a result of fiscal year 2017 acquisitions.\n \u2022 changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n\nNet Sales. Commercial segment net sales were $620.1 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $58.9 million, or 8.7%, from $679.0 million for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in net sales was due primarily to a decrease in the number of shuttle and school bus units sold compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher sales of transit buses and terminal trucks compared to the prior year. This was also partially offset by higher average realized pricing compared to the prior year due to sales mix and strategic pricing initiatives. Excluding the impact of net sales from acquired companies, Commercial segment net sales decreased 8.8% compared to the prior year.\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe nature and amount of such restructuring costs vary significantly based on the number of completed acquisitions and the size and timing of related and other restructuring programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items are useful to investors by supplementing the GAAP information with an additional measure that can be used to assess the Company's operating performance.\nREV is a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of specialty vehicles and related aftermarket parts and services. We provide customized vehicle solutions for applications including: essential needs (ambulances, fire apparatus, school buses, mobility vans and municipal transit buses), industrial and commercial (terminal trucks, cut-away buses and street sweepers) and consumer leisure (recreational vehicles RVs\u201d and luxury buses). Our brand portfolio consists of 29 well-established principal vehicle brands including many of the most recognizable names within our served markets. Several of our brands pioneered their specialty vehicle product categories and date back more than 50 years. We believe that in most of our markets, we hold the first or second market share position and approximately 63% of our net sales during fiscal year 2017 came from products where we believe we hold such share positions.\nLong-Lived Assets, Including Definite-Lived Intangibles\nFire & Emergency Segment\nStock Compensation Expense\n\nAcquisitions are accounted for using purchase accounting. The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business, in each case based on their estimated fair values. Any excess consideration transferred is recorded as goodwill. A bargain purchase gain is recognized to the extent the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase price. The results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition.\n (d) Reflects expenses associated with stock-based compensation. For fiscal year 2017, stock-based compensation expense includes $13.3 million for the remeasurement of liability awards to our IPO share price, $8.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of liability awards and stock options resulting from the completion of our IPO and $3.3 million was related to the redemption of performance based stock options. For fiscal year 2016, stock-based compensation expense includes $10.3 million related to the redemption of performance based stock options. We do not expect that such accelerated vesting, the remeasurement of outstanding liability awards and repurchase of outstanding stock options will be an ongoing cost following completion our IPO. For this reason, following the completion of our IPO, we expect substantially all of our stock-based compensation expense to be a non-cash expense that follows a normal vesting schedule. \nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2016 was $14.7 million, which primarily consisted of net borrowings from our previous ABL facility, offset partially by $21.7 million of payments to redeem common stock and common stock options and the repayment of debt assumed in the Hall-Mark Acquisition.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses in fiscal year 2017 were $188.3 million which is an increase of $48.5 million compared to fiscal year 2016. This increase was primarily due to additional SG&A expenses from acquired companies and higher stock compensation expense related to our IPO.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2017 was $202.9 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from our IPO offset by the use of those proceeds to redeem our Notes, and further net borrowings from the April 2017 ABL Facility and Term Loan to support acquisitions and working capital requirements.\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of operational and financial measures. These measures include net sales, units sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income. In assessing segment performance, our chief executive officer, as the chief operating decision maker, analyzes the primary financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA.\nIn considering the financial performance of the business, management analyzes the primary financial performance measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income for the relevant period before depreciation and amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes, as adjusted for certain items described below that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income, as adjusted for certain items described below that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor Adjusted Net Income is a measure defined by GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income is net income for the relevant period.\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted Net Income for the periods presented (in thousands):\n (f) Reflects losses recognized upon the redemption of our Notes in February 2017. The Company paid a prepayment premium of $7.7 million and wrote off $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and $0.4 million of original issue discount. The loss on early extinguishment of debt also includes the write-off of $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of our debt re-financing in April 2017. \nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2015 was $17.6 million, which primarily consisted of net repayments of our revolving credit facility and payments to redeem common stock and common stock options, offset partially by the net proceeds from sales of our common stock.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\n\nIf the fair value of any reporting unit, as calculated using the income approach, is less than its carrying value, the fair value of the implied goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill. An impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value for each reporting unit.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2016 was $84.4 million, which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $48.5 million and $31.7 million of payments for the acquisition of KME.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our consolidated financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, future results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nBased on this evaluation, we establish a reserve for specific accounts receivable that are believed to be uncollectible, as well as an estimate of uncollectible receivables not specifically known. Historical trends and our current knowledge of potential collection problems provide us with sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for an allowance for uncollectible accounts. Receivables are written off when management determines collection is highly unlikely and collection efforts have ceased. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Recreation segment Adjusted EBITDA was $36.2 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $25.2 million, or 229.1%, from $11.0 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in gross profit offset partially by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in gross profit was due to higher unit sales volumes, lower cost of materials, lower cost of quality as a percentage of sales, higher average selling prices resulting from product mix, and the impact of acquired companies. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to expenses from acquired companies. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Recreation segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 136.7% compared to the prior year.\nGross profit and gross margin percentage were $294.6 million and 13.0%, respectively, in fiscal year 2017, which were $64.7 million and 105 basis points higher than in fiscal year 2016. These improvements in gross profit and gross margin percentage were due to realized benefits from higher sales (including parts), our ongoing materials sourcing initiatives, a more profitable mix of sales in our Fire & Emergency segment, lower cost of quality and strategic pricing actions.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, the Company paid cash dividends of $6.4 million.\nInterest expense was $20.7 million in fiscal year 2017, which is a decrease of $8.4 million compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The decrease in interest expense was due to the impact of debt reduction from our IPO and our debt refinancing in April 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNet Income. Consolidated net income was $31.4 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $1.2 million, or 3.9% from net income of $30.2 million for fiscal year 2016.\n\nRestructuring. Consolidated restructuring costs were $4.5 million for fiscal year 2017, compared to $3.5 million in fiscal year 2016. Restructuring costs in fiscal year 2017 represent costs incurred to restructure some of the Company's management functions in the Commercial segment and in our Corporate office, which consisted of personnel costs, including severance and other employee benefit payments. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a plan to relocate production of Goshen Coach buses from its Elkhart, Indiana facility to its facilities in Salina, Kansas and Imlay City, Michigan and the relocation of our mobility van production facility from Salina, Kansas to Longview, Texas.\n\n\nCommercial Segment\nOn April 25, 2017, the Company entered into a $75.0 million term loan ( Term Loan\u201d or Term Loan Agreement\u201d), as Borrower, with certain subsidiaries of the Company as Guarantor Subsidiaries. Principal may be prepaid at any time during the term of the Term Loan without penalty. The Company incurred $2.0 million in debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan. The Term Loan Agreement expires on April 25, 2022.\n (b) Reflects the reimbursement of expenses to AIP, the Company's primary equity holder. \nAs a result of our IPO, outstanding stock options which had previously been recorded as a liability on the Company's balance sheet were reclassified to permanent equity. On the date of the IPO, vesting of 846,000 of these liability awards were accelerated, and there were 1,528,000 of vested liability option awards. All liability option awards were re-measured at fair value based upon the IPO offering price of $22.00 per share. Also as a result of the IPO, the Company recorded stock compensation expense of $13.3 million due to the change in fair value of the liability option awards and $8.9 million due to stock options which immediately vested.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nFire & Emergency Segment\nCost of Sales. Consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 87.0% for fiscal year 2017 as compared to 88.1% for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in consolidated cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily due to net reductions in the costs of materials resulting from specific sourcing initiatives, lower cost of quality, and the benefits of higher production volumes. In addition, cost of sales in fiscal year 2017 were lower as a percent of net sales due to strategic pricing initiatives for certain vehicle classes.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit was $229.9 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $48.0 million, or 26.4% from $182.0 million for fiscal year 2015. Consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 11.9% and 10.5% for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The increase in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was due to the combination of higher net sales and lower cost of sales described above.\nCommercial - Our Commercial segment serves the bus market through the following principal brands: Collins Bus, Goshen Coach, ENC, ElDorado National, Krystal Coach, Federal Coach, Champion and World Trans. We serve the terminal truck market through the Capacity brand, the sweeper market through the Lay-Mor brand and the mobility van market through our recently recast Revability brand. We are a leading producer of small- and medium-sized buses, Type A school buses, transit buses, terminal trucks and street sweepers in the United States. Our products in the Commercial segment include cut-away buses (customized body built on various types and sizes of commercial chassis), transit buses (large municipal buses where we build our own chassis and body), luxury buses (bus-style limo or high-end luxury conversions), street sweepers (three- and four-wheel versions used in road construction activities), terminal trucks (specialized vehicle which moves freight in warehouses or intermodal yards and ports), Type A school buses (small school bus built on commercial chassis), and mobility vans (mini-van converted to be utilized by wheelchair passengers). Within each market segment, we produce a large number of customized configurations to address the diverse needs of our customers.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as analytical tools. These are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP, nor are they measures of financial condition and they should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net loss for the period determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, such measures do not reflect:\nOur recent operating results reflect the impact of our ongoing initiatives to lower our operating costs to expand our profit margins. Purchased materials, including chassis, represent our largest component of costs of sales. We operate a centralized strategic procurement organization dedicated to reducing our overall level of materials spend across our three segments, while simplifying and standardizing suppliers and parts. Reduction in our cost of quality is also a major enterprise-wide focus. We share best practices and manage improvement initiatives from a central operations team as well as at the individual business unit level.\nWe serve a diversified customer base primarily in the United States through the following segments:\nThe nature and amount of such restructuring costs vary significantly based on the number of completed acquisitions and the size and timing of related and other restructuring programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items are useful to investors by supplementing the GAAP information with an additional measure that can be used to assess the Company's operating performance.\nOn April 25, 2017, the Company entered into a new $350.0 million ABL revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the April 2017 ABL Facility\u201d). The April 2017 ABL Facility provides for revolving loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $350.0 million. The total April 2017 ABL Facility is subject to a $30.0 million sublimit for swing line loans and a $35.0 million sublimit for letters of credit, along with certain borrowing base and other customary restrictions as defined in the April 2017 ABL Agreement. The April 2017 ABL Facility expires on April 25, 2022.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\u201d ( ASU 2015-17\u201d), which simplifies the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the classified balance sheet, rather than separating such deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We prospectively adopted ASU 2015-17 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and therefore prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Consolidated amortization of intangible assets was $14.9 million for fiscal year 2017, compared to $9.4 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in amortization expense was due to the amortization of the intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of KME in April 2016, Renegade in December 2016 and Midwest and Ferrara in April 2017.\nOverview\nEach of our three segments has a backlog of new vehicle orders that generally extends out from two to twelve months in duration. Our businesses take orders from our dealers and end customers that are evidenced by a firm purchase order for delivery of one or many specialty vehicles and parts with a given specification over a period of time. These firm orders are placed in our backlog and reported at the aggregate selling prices, net of discounts or allowances, at the time the purchase order is received. We do not include verbal commitments or promised orders in our reported backlog. For fiscal year 2017, our backlog was $1,101.6 million compared to $857.3 million in fiscal year 2016. The increase in Fire & Emergency and Recreation backlogs were partially due to the current year acquisitions of Ferrara, Renegade and Midwest. In addition, our Commercial segment backlog at October 31, 2017 includes a portion of a large transit bus order that is expected to begin delivering in early fiscal year 2019. We expect that\nUnder the quantitative method, the fair value of each reporting unit of the Company is determined by using the income approach and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The income approach involves discounting management's projections of future cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a discount rate which approximates the Company's weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d). Key assumptions used in the income approach include future sales growth, gross margin and operating expenses trends, depreciation expense, taxes, capital expenditures and changes in working capital. Projected future cash flows are based on income forecasts and management's knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. The WACC incorporates equity and debt return rates observed in the market for a group of comparable public companies in the industry, and is determined using an average debt to equity ratio of selected comparable public companies, and is also adjusted for risk premiums and the Company's capital structure. The terminal value is based upon the projected cash flow for the final projected year, and is calculated using estimates of growth of the net cash flows based on the Company's estimate of stable growth for each financial reporting unit. The inputs and assumptions used in the determination of fair value are considered Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\n (e) Reflects the amortization of the difference between the fair market and book value of certain acquired inventory which was sold. \n (d) Unrecognized tax benefits totaling $2.6 million as of October 31, 2017, excluding related interests and penalties, are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. See Note 17 to our 2017 audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K for disclosures regarding uncertain income tax positions under ASC Topic 740. \nFire & Emergency - The Fire & Emergency segment sells fire apparatus equipment under the Emergency One ( E-ONE\u201d), Kovatch Mobile Equipment ( KME\u201d) and Ferrara brands and ambulances under the American Emergency Vehicles ( AEV\u201d), Horton Emergency Vehicles ( Horton\u201d), Leader Emergency Vehicles ( Leader\u201d), Marque, McCoy Miller, Road Rescue, Wheeled Coach and Frontline brands. We believe we are the largest manufacturer by unit volume of fire and emergency vehicles in the United States and have one of the industry's broadest portfolios of products including Type I ambulances (aluminum body mounted on a heavy truck-style chassis), Type II ambulances (van conversion ambulance typically favored for non-emergency patient transportation), Type III ambulances (aluminum body mounted on a van-style chassis), pumpers (fire apparatus on a custom or commercial chassis with a water pump and small tank to extinguish fires), ladder trucks (fire apparatus with stainless steel or aluminum ladders), tanker trucks and rescue and other vehicles. Each of our individual brands is distinctly positioned and targets certain price and feature points in the market such that dealers often carry and customers often buy more than one REV Fire & Emergency product line. In April 2017, we acquired Ferrara Fire Apparatus, a leader in custom fire apparatus and rescue vehicles.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\n (c) In fiscal year 2017, the Company restructured some of its management functions in its Commercial segment and in its Corporate office and incurred personnel costs, including severance and other employee benefit payments of approximately $1.5 million. At October 31, 2017, a balance of $0.6 million of the restructuring costs remained unpaid. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a strategic plan to relocate production of Goshen buses to its Salina, KS and Imlay City, MI facilities. The Company recognized $3.0 million of costs associated with the relocation, including but not limited to personnel costs, severance and bonuses in fiscal year 2017, and $0.7 million of such costs were recognized in fiscal year 2016. \nRecreation Segment\nThe components of our selling, general and administrative expenses may not be identical to those of our competitors. As a result, data in this document regarding our operating and administrative expenses may not be comparable to similar expenses of our competitors. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as we grow our businesses and due to additional legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses we expect to incur as a result of being a public company.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were $139.8 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $37.5 million, or 36.6%, from $102.3 million for fiscal year 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 7.3% and 5.9% for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increased corporate and marketing expenses. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2016 included $19.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, of which $10.3 million pertains to the acceleration and repurchase of outstanding options from former employees and $6.5 million pertains to the remeasurement of outstanding liability awards to fair value, which were required to be recorded at fair value as a result of becoming a public entity after the filing of our Form S-1 with the SEC.\nPrior to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock was calculated by determining our enterprise value by applying an earnings multiple to our Adjusted EBITDA over the previous 12 months, and deducting outstanding debt, then dividing by the number of shares of common stock outstanding. The assumption for forfeitures is based upon historical experience. As we have not historically paid dividends on our common stock, we have previously assumed a 0% dividend rate for all outstanding stock options.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $162.5 million fiscal year 2017, an increase of $39.7 million or 32.3%, from $122.8 million in fiscal year 2016. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of acquisitions and higher net sales and gross profit from certain business segments described above. A detailed reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is included in the section -Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\u201d below.\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed generally include tangible and intangible assets, as well as contingent assets and liabilities. When available, the estimated fair values of these assets and liabilities are determined based on observable inputs, such as quoted market prices, information from comparable transactions, offers made by other prospective acquirers (in such cases where we may have certain rights to acquire additional interests in existing investments) and the replacement cost of assets in the same condition or stage of usefulness (Level 1 and 2). Unobservable inputs, such as expected future cash flows or internally developed estimates of value (Level 3), are used if observable inputs are not available.\nCash Flow\nIn April 2017, the Company repaid all outstanding loans and obligations under the ABL Facility in full, and the ABL Facility was terminated.\nThe below table of material debt and lease commitments at October 31, 2017 summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods as set forth in the table below.\nThe Company accounts for business combinations by estimating the fair value of consideration paid for acquired businesses, including contingent consideration, and assigning that amount to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the remainder assigned to goodwill. If the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the fair value of consideration paid, a gain on bargain purchase is recognized. The estimates of fair values are determined utilizing customary valuation procedures and techniques, which require us, among other things, to estimate future cash flows and discount rates. Such analyses involve significant judgments and estimations.\n (e) Reflects the amortization of the difference between the book value and fair market value of certain acquired inventory that was subsequently sold after the acquisition date. \n (c) In fiscal year 2017, the Company restructured some of its management functions in its Commercial segment and in its Corporate office and incurred personnel costs, including severance and other employee benefit payments of approximately $1.5 million. At October 31, 2017, a balance of $0.6 million of these restructuring costs remained unpaid. \n stock options will be an ongoing cost following completion of our IPO. For this reason, we expect substantially all of our stock-based compensation expense to be a non-cash expense that follows a normal vesting schedule. \nKey Performance Indicators\nCost of Sales. Consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 88.1% for fiscal year 2016 as compared to 89.5% for fiscal year 2015. The decrease in consolidated cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily due to a decrease in cost of sales in the Fire & Emergency and Commercial segments, offset by an increase in cost of sales in the Recreation segment. The aggregate reduction in cost of sales for the Company was due to the enterprise-wide implementation of strategic price increases, net reductions in the costs of materials resulting from specific sourcing initiatives, and the benefits of higher unit sales volumes.\nCustomer advances include amounts received in advance of the completion of vehicles or in advance of services being rendered. Such customer advances are recorded as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet until the vehicle is shipped or the service rendered.\nOur units represent a wide range of products at various price points, with higher value-added units at higher price points typically resulting in higher gross margins. Additionally, large orders of similar units typically provide operational efficiencies that contribute to higher gross margins. As such, our management also utilizes unit volume sales mix to analyze the performance of our business.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The amendments in this update require, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of leases with a duration of less than 12 months) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We expect to adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 to our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, excluding interest expense; and \nPrincipal may be repaid at any time during the term of the April 2017 ABL Facility without penalty.\n\nAdjusted Net Income. Consolidated Adjusted net income in fiscal year 2017 was $75.9 million, which is a 42.7% increase over $53.2 million in fiscal year 2016.\nWe believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy, cash dividends and additional expenses we expect to incur as a public company. However, we cannot assure you that our cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the April 2017 ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and if availability under the April 2017 ABL Facility is not sufficient due to the size of our borrowing base or other external factors, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nStock compensation expense is recorded over the agreed upon vesting term of the associated stock option grants, and is measured based upon the estimation of the fair value of all stock option awards on the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model (the Black-Scholes Model\u201d). The application of the Black-Scholes Model requires us to make certain assumptions such as the fair value of our common stock on the grant date, forfeitures of option grants and the rate of dividend payments on our common stock. Other assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes Model include volatility of the share price of select peer public companies and the risk free rate.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements\u201d ( ASU 2015-15\u201d), which clarifies the guidance set forth in ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), issued in April 2015. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. ASU 2015-15 provides additional guidance regarding debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, stating that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-03 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 (the Company's fiscal year 2017), and early adoption was permitted. In fiscal year 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 and debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability for all periods presented. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 did not have a material effect our consolidated financial statements.\nSegments\n\nNet Sales and Units Sold\nWe also adjust for exceptional items which are determined to be those that in management's judgment need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, which include non-cash items and items settled in cash. In determining whether an event or transaction is exceptional, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence. This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to our Board of Directors, assists in providing a meaningful analysis of our operating performance and used as a measurement in incentive compensation for management. Based on the foregoing factors, management considers the adjustment for non-cash purchase accounting to be an exceptional item.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)\u201d ( ASU 2016-09\u201d), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for the related income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company's fiscal year 2018), including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 to our consolidated financial statements is dependent upon the Company's share price, income tax rates and the timing of stock option exercises.\nTerm Loan\nResults of Operations\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are the primary metrics we use to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our markets. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are useful performance measures and we use them to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, we also utilize the metric of Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales as a complimentary measurement of performance among our businesses and versus our competitors. We also use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income as primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain compensation programs and plans for employees, including our senior executives.\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, inventory management, acquiring machinery and equipment, acquiring and building manufacturing facilities, the improvement and expansion of existing manufacturing facilities, debt service payments, regular quarterly dividend payments, and general corporate needs. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Company recognized $2.8 million of costs associated with this re-organization and office relocation, which included severance, lease termination and other associated expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\nNet income was $31.4 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to net income of $30.2 million in fiscal year 2016. Adjusted Net Income in fiscal year 2017 was $75.9 million, which is a 42.7% increase over $53.2 million in fiscal year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Fire & Emergency segment Adjusted EBITDA was $85.2 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $21.9 million, or 34.5%, from $63.3 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased average realized pricing, procurement initiatives and other operational improvements, as well as increased net sales from the acquired KME and the Hall-Mark businesses, which was partially offset by reduced units shipped compared to the prior year and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n (b) Based on interest rates in effect as of October 31, 2017. \nIn accordance with GAAP, we recognize acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. This includes the recognition of identified intangible assets and goodwill which, in the case of definite-life intangible assets, are then amortized over their expected useful lives, which typically results in an increase in amortization expense. In addition, assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally include tangible assets, as well as contingent assets and liabilities.\nInterest Expense. Consolidated interest expense was $29.2 million and $27.3 million for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The increase in consolidated interest expense was due primarily to additional interest expense from our revolving credit facility, which was primarily due to higher borrowings for capital expenditures and business acquisitions compared to the prior year.\n (d) Reflects expenses associated with stock-based compensation. For fiscal year 2017, stock-based compensation expense includes $13.3 million for the remeasurement of liability awards to our IPO share price, $8.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of liability awards and stock options resulting from the completion of our IPO and $3.3 million was related to the redemption of performance based stock options. Approximately $6.5 million of stock-based compensation for fiscal year 2016 related to the non-cash remeasurement of outstanding liability awards to fair value. The remeasurement of the liability awards was required as a result of the Company becoming a public entity after the filing of its Form S-1 with the SEC. The remaining stock-based compensation expense of $2.9 million for fiscal year 2016 was normal vesting. Except for the additional non-cash stock compensation expense which was recognized concurrently with the immediate vesting of stock options as a result of our IPO, we do not expect that such accelerated vesting, the remeasurement of outstanding liability awards and repurchase of outstanding \n (a) Reflects costs incurred in connection with business acquisitions and offerings of our common stock. \nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nA decrease in employment levels, consumer confidence or the availability of financing, or other adverse economic events, or the failure of actual demand for our products to meet our estimates, could negatively affect the demand for our products. Any decline in overall customer demand in markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805)-Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\u201d ( ASU 2015-16\u201d). ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer in a business combination recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, rather than as retrospective adjustments. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 (the Company's fiscal year 2017), including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2015-16 was applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of ASU 2015-16 with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOctober 2013 ABL Facility\nStock compensation expense for restricted and performance stock awards is recorded over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The grant date fair value is equal to the closing share price on the date of grant.\nNet Sales. Fire & Emergency segment net sales were $984.0 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $216.0 million, or 28.1%, from $768.1 million for fiscal year 2016. Net sales of fire apparatus increased $176.9 million due primarily to sales from acquired companies and increased fire apparatus and ambulance units sold in our legacy businesses. In fiscal year 2017, we had incremental net sales of $151.9 million from KME and Ferrara, which were acquired in April 2016 and April 2017. Net sales of ambulance units increased $39.1 million compared to the prior year due to an increased mix of higher content vehicles and an increase in units sold. Excluding the impact of net sales from acquired companies, Fire & Emergency segment net sales increased 8.3% compared to the prior year.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. This standard will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. Under the new standard, entities are required to identify the contract with a customer, identify the separate performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract and recognize the appropriate amount of revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies each performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (the Company's fiscal year 2019). We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nExcluding stock-based compensation expense, operating income increased by $17.2 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016.\nIn fiscal year 2017, our net sales were $2,267.8 million, which were $341.8 million, or 17.7%, greater than fiscal year 2016. This increase in net sales was due to increases in our Fire & Emergency and Recreation segments. In fiscal year 2018 we expect sales in our Fire & Emergency segment to increase at a rate slightly better than the sales percent increase for the overall company due to increased unit volume, as a result of the full year impact of the Ferrara Fire Apparatus ( Ferrara\u201d) acquisition, and strong end-market demand across both our fire and ambulance product lines. In our Commercial segment for fiscal year 2018, we expect net sales to increase at a rate below the net sales percent increase for the entire company. In our Recreation segment, we expect net sales to increase in fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017 at a rate better than the net sales percent increase for the overall company as a result of higher unit sales volume in both Class A and Class C RV units due to end market demand growth, continued growth in market share across both RV classes and as a result of the Renegade and Midwest Automotive Designs ( Midwest\u201d) acquisitions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2017 was $33.2 million, compared to $75.6 million for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in cash from operating activities for fiscal year 2017, compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in inventory, higher cash outflows for other liabilities and lower incoming customer advance payments, which was partially offset by an increase in current year income from operations and faster current year collections of accounts receivable.\n (e) Reflects the amortization of the difference between the book value and fair market value of certain acquired inventory that was subsequently sold after the acquisition date. \nCapital expenditures for fiscal year 2018, excluding any acquisitions, are estimated to be approximately $50 to $55 million.\nOn October 21, 2013, we entered into a $150.0 million senior secured asset based lending revolving credit and guaranty agreement (the Asset Based Lending ABL\u201d or the ABL Facility\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders. On April 22, 2016, we exercised our $50.0 million incremental commitment option under the ABL Facility in conjunction with the acquisition of KME. On August 19, 2016, we amended the ABL Facility to increase the commitment from $200.0 million to $300.0 million to provide flexibility and access to the suppressed borrowing base. All other terms and conditions of the ABL Facility remained unchanged.\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2017 of $229.1 million was primarily due to business acquisition activity and capital expenditures. In fiscal year 2017, the Company completed the acquisitions of Renegade, Midwest and Ferrara.\nCost Management Initiatives\n (c) Includes obligations under non-cancellable purchase orders for raw materials or chassis as of October 31, 2017. \nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP, nor are they measures of financial condition or liquidity and they should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or net income, respectively, for the period determined in accordance with GAAP.\nDiluted net income per common share was $0.50 in fiscal year 2017 compared to $0.58 in fiscal year 2016. Adjusted diluted net income per common share was $1.22 per share in fiscal year 2017, which is a 18.4% increase from $1.03 in fiscal year 2016 even with a greater number of weighted average shares outstanding in fiscal year 2017. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income is included in the section -Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\u201d below.\nRevenue Recognition\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a plan to relocate production of Goshen Coach buses from its Elkhart, Indiana facility to its facilities in Salina, Kansas and Imlay City, Michigan and the relocation of our mobility van production from Salina, Kansas to Longview, Texas. Additionally, costs incurred in the current year quarter consisted of personnel costs, including severance, vacation and other employee benefit payments.\n \u2022 the cash requirements to pay our taxes and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, excluding income tax expense. \nThe nature and amount of such restructuring costs vary significantly based on the number of completed acquisitions and the size and timing of related and other restructuring programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items are useful to investors by supplementing the GAAP information with an additional measure that can be used to assess the Company's operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $162.5 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $39.7 million, or 32.3%, from $122.8 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, resulting from higher net sales, lower manufacturing costs and the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased 19.1% for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016.\nNet Sales. Fire & Emergency segment net sales were $768.1 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $147.9 million, or 23.8%, from $620.2 million for fiscal year 2015. Net sales of fire apparatus increased $134.1 million compared to the prior year, due primarily to net sales of $97.2 million from KME, which was acquired in April 2016, net sales of $38.3 million from the acquisition of certain assets and assumed liabilities of Hall-Mark Fire Apparatus Inc. ( Hall-Mark\u201d and the Hall-Mark Acquisition\u201d) in November 2015, and a larger mix of higher content units from our legacy fire business. Net sales of ambulance units increased $13.8 million compared to the prior year due primarily to sales mix of higher content units, offset by lower unit volume. In addition, net sales across all Fire & Emergency products increased due to the implementation of strategic price increases for certain models and markets.\n (a) Includes estimated principal payments due under our Term Loan and the April 2017 ABL Facility as of October 31, 2017. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2015 was $15.6 million, which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $15.4 million.\nOffering of Common Stock\nAccounts Receivable\nThe higher cash outflows for other liabilities in fiscal year 2017, compared to the prior year was partially due to higher management incentive bonus payments made in the first quarter of the current year versus the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 related to the prior year performance. Also, cash outflows were higher due to the timing of income tax payments, which were $5.5 million greater in fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior year. The increase in inventory was due to increased sales volumes and the timing of vehicle production.\nWhen determining the fair value of indefinite-lived trade names, the Company uses the relief from royalty method which requires the determination of fair value based on if the Company was licensing the right to the trade name in exchange for a royalty fee. The Company utilizes the income approach to determine future revenues to which to apply a royalty rate. The royalty rate is based on research of industry and market data related to transactions involving the licensing of comparable intangible assets. In considering the value of trade names, the Company looks to relative age, consistent use, quality, expansion possibilities, relative profitability and relative market potential.\nCommercial Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\nSegment Reporting\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. With the exception of operating lease obligations, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures and capital resources. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\n\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\u201d ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). Under ASU 2015-11, entities should measure inventory that is not measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method, including inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out or average cost, at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company's fiscal year 2018), and is to be applied prospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n (a) Reflects costs incurred in connection with business acquisitions and offerings of our common stock. \nThe following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for each of the quarters in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods in accordance with GAAP. This data should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for a full year or any future period.\nThe April 2017 ABL Facility contains certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the ABL Facility as of October 31, 2017.\nBacklog\nSeasonality\nThe primary factors affecting our results of operations include:\n (a) Reflects costs incurred in connection with business acquisitions and offerings of our common stock. \nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of trade names, are not amortized, however, the Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that its carrying amount may not exceed its fair value. The annual impairment review is performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year based upon information and estimates available at that time. To perform the impairment testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of the Company's reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts as a basis for determining whether or not to perform the quantitative impairment test. Qualitative testing includes the evaluation of economic conditions, financial performance and other factors such as key events when they occur. The Company then estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and each indefinite-lived intangible asset not meeting the qualitative criteria and compares their fair values to their carrying values.\nImpact of Initial Public Offering\nNet Sales. Commercial segment net sales were $679.0 million for fiscal year 2016, a decrease of $22.9 million, or 3.3%, from $702.0 million for fiscal year 2015. The decrease in net sales was due primarily to a decrease in shuttle bus unit volume due to selective bid participation, partially offset by higher sales of Type A school buses and transit buses compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by higher average realized pricing compared to the prior year.\nIn a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically the slowest quarters have been the first and second fiscal quarters when the purchasing seasons for vehicles such as school buses, RVs and sweepers are the lowest due to the colder weather and the relatively long time until summer vacation season, and the school year is underway with municipalities and school bus contractors utilizing their existing fleets to transport student populations. Sales of our products have typically been higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters (with the fourth fiscal quarter typically being the strongest) due to better weather, the vacation season, buying habits of RV dealers and end-users, timing of government/municipal customer fiscal years, and the beginning of a new school year. Sales and earnings for other vehicles that we produce, such as essential emergency vehicles and commercial bus fleets, are less seasonal, but fluctuations in sales of these vehicles can also be impacted by timing surrounding the fiscal years of municipalities and commercial customers, as well as the timing and amounts of multi-unit larger orders. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-Some of the markets in which we compete are seasonal, which results in fluctuations in sales and results of operations.\u201d\nResearch and Development. Consolidated research and development costs were $4.2 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 12.4% from $4.8 million for fiscal year 2016.\nStock Compensation Expense\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Consolidated amortization of intangible assets was $9.4 million for fiscal year 2016, compared to $8.6 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in amortization expenses was due primarily to the amortization of the additional intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of KME in April 2016.\nWe account for income taxes under the guidance of Accounting Standard Codification 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for which utilization is not more likely than not. Management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\nPrior to our IPO, our stockholders were party to a shareholders agreement that was amended and restated in its entirety as a result of the IPO. That previous shareholders agreement provided for, among other things, an employee stockholder to sell their stock back to the Company when he or she is terminated by the Company without cause or for good reason, death, disability, retirement or dissolution. This provision required us to recognize the value of these outstanding shares as temporary equity in our consolidated balance sheet, with changes in the fair value recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. The aforementioned rights of the employee stockholder to sell his or her shares of common stock lapsed upon completion of our IPO and, at that time, those outstanding shares which were held by an employee were reclassified to shareholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the IPO, the fair value of our common stock held by employees subject to the previous shareholders agreement was $35.4 million, which was reclassified to additional paid in capital on the Company's consolidated balance sheet on the IPO date.\nOn February 16, 2017, we redeemed in full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes ( Notes\u201d) with a portion of the proceeds from the IPO. The Company paid a prepayment premium of $7.7 million and accrued interest of $4.5 million as of the redemption date.\nCapital expenditures were $54.0 million in fiscal year 2017, and were primarily comprised of expenditures for manufacturing facility equipment and improvements, new product tooling, our ongoing ERP system implementation, and the continued rollout of our online parts sales infrastructure.\nWhile less economically sensitive than the Recreation segment and our terminal truck business, our Fire & Emergency segment and the remainder of the Commercial segment are also impacted by the overall economic environment. Local tax revenues are an important source of funding for fire and emergency response departments. Reduced municipal tax revenues resulting from the 2008 recession led to a decline in these markets. As fire and emergency products and buses are typically a larger cost item for municipalities and their service life is relatively long, their purchase is more deferrable, which can result in reduced demand for our products.\nPrior to our IPO, our stockholders were party to a shareholders agreement that was amended and restated in its entirety. Due to provisions in that shareholders agreement, employee shareholders were allowed to put his or her shares to us under certain circumstances. As such, certain outstanding stock options were considered liability awards and were recorded at fair value and recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. As a result of our IPO, the aforementioned put rights expired and the outstanding options were no longer considered liability awards and the fair value of the options have been reclassified to additional paid-in capital.\nThe following table shows summary cash flows for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nAdjusted EBITDA. Commercial segment Adjusted EBITDA was $50.5 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 5.4%, from $53.4 million for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to reduced shuttle bus unit volume compared to the prior year, which was offset by lower material costs, increased average realized pricing, and a shift in sales mix toward transit buses and terminal trucks as a percentage of total segment sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Commercial segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.8% compared to the prior year.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nIncome Taxes\nFor purposes of business segment performance measurement, we do not allocate to individual business segments costs or items that are of a non-operating nature or organizational or functional expenses of a corporate nature. The caption Corporate and Other\u201d includes corporate office expenses, including stock-based compensation, results of insignificant operations, intersegment eliminations and income and expenses not allocated to reportable segments. Identifiable assets of the business segments exclude general corporate assets, which principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, certain property, plant and equipment and certain other assets pertaining to corporate and other centralized activities.\nWe evaluate net sales and units sold because it helps us measure the impact of economic trends, the effectiveness of our marketing, the response of customers to new product launches and model changes, and the effect of competition over a given period. We recognize revenue for sales of completed vehicles upon shipment or delivery and acceptance by the dealer or customer as specified by the relevant dealer or customer purchase order.\nGeneral\nCapital Expenditures\nFunds from the April 2017 ABL Facility were used to repay borrowings on the previous ABL Facility and to fund the Ferrara acquisition.\n (b) Reflects the reimbursement of expenses to AIP, the Company's primary equity holder. \nProperty, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an analysis is necessitated by the occurrence of a triggering event, we compare the carrying amount of the asset group with the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group with its estimated fair value. Such analyses necessarily involve significant judgments and estimations on our part.\nWe recognize revenue for sales of vehicles, parts and other finished products when contract terms are met, collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer. In certain instances, risk of ownership and title passes when the product has been completed in accordance with purchase order specifications and has been tendered for delivery to the customer. Periodically, certain customers request bill and hold transactions. In those cases, revenue recognition for vehicles occurs after the customer has been notified that the products have been completed according to the customer specifications, have passed all of our quality control inspections, and are ready for delivery.\nInterest Expense. Consolidated interest expense was $20.7 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 28.8% from $29.2 million for fiscal year 2016, respectively. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the repayment of our Notes in February 2017 with net proceeds from our IPO and the impact of our debt refinancing in April 2017.\nRV purchases are discretionary in nature and therefore sensitive to the availability of financing, consumer confidence, unemployment levels, levels of disposable income and changing levels of consumer home equity, among other factors. The 2008 recession caused consumers to reduce their discretionary spending, which negatively affected sales volumes for RVs. Terminal truck sales volumes are also impacted by economic conditions and industrial output, as these factors impact our end-market customers for these products, which include shipping ports, trucking/distribution hubs and rail terminal operators. Although RV and terminal truck sales have increased in recent years, these markets are affected by general U.S. and global economic conditions, which create risks that future economic downturns will further reduce consumer demand and negatively impact our sales.\nBusiness Combinations\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $11.9 million for fiscal year 2017, which includes losses recognized upon the redemption of our Notes in February 2017 and our April 2017 re-financing. The Company paid a prepayment premium of $7.7 million and wrote off $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and $0.4 million of original issue discount resulting from the redemption of our Notes. Loss on early extinguishment of debt also includes the write-off of $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of our debt re-financing in April 2017.\nRevenue from service agreements is recognized as earned when services are rendered. Intercompany sales are eliminated upon consolidation. Provisions are made for discounts, returns and sales allowances based on management's best estimate and the historical experience of each business unit. Sales are recorded net of amounts invoiced for taxes imposed on the customer, such as excise or value-added taxes.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a plan to relocate production of Goshen Coach buses from its Elkhart, Indiana facility to its facilities in Salina, Kansas and Imlay City, Michigan and the relocation of our mobility van production from Salina, Kansas to Longview, Texas. Additionally, costs incurred in the current year quarter consisted of personnel costs, including severance, vacation and other employee benefit payments.\nLong-term debt, excluding current maturities, at October 31, 2017 was $229.1 million compared to $256.0 million at October 29, 2016. Long-term debt decreased primarily due to the use of net proceeds from our IPO to redeem our Notes and partially pay down the outstanding balance on our revolving credit, offset by the increase in working capital described above, increased borrowings to fund the acquisitions of Renegade, Midwest and Ferrara and capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017.\nNet Sales. Consolidated net sales were $1,926.0 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $190.9 million, or 11.0%, from $1,735.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in consolidated net sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales of $147.9 million and $65.1 million in the Fire & Emergency and Recreation segments, respectively, offset by a decrease in net sales of $22.9 million in the Commercial segment. Increases in Fire & Emergency segment net sales were due to higher fire apparatus volumes, $97.2 million of net sales from KME, which was acquired in April 2016, and higher average selling prices for both fire apparatus and ambulances. Higher net sales in the Recreation segment were due to higher unit sales volumes primarily in its Class A diesel products. Lower Commercial segment net sales were primarily due to lower shuttle bus units shipped during fiscal year 2016.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nWe evaluate our selling, general and administrative expenses in order to identify areas where we can further invest or create cost savings. Such investments or spending reductions could include items such as third-party services and cost of administrative processes. These expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, sales and marketing expenses, as well as other expenses associated with facilities unrelated to our manufacturing and supply chain network, internal management expenses and expenses for finance, information systems, legal, business development, human resources, purchasing and other administrative functions.\nBacklog represents orders received from dealers or directly from end customers. Backlog does not include purchase options or verbal orders. The following table presents a summary of our backlog by segment (in thousands):\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRecreation Segment\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2016 was $75.6 million compared to $25.6 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase in cash provided by activities was due to an increase in operating income in fiscal year 2016 as well as increased cash flows for accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by reduced cash flows for accounts receivable and inventories. Operating income increased $10.3 million, which was due to higher gross margin offset by increased corporate and marketing expenses. The increase in cash flows for accounts payable was due to timing of vendor payments. The increase in cash outflows for other liabilities was due to the timing of payments for payroll and related benefits and incentive compensation and income tax payments, as the Company's accruals for these expenses at the end of fiscal year 2016 were $20.5 million higher than the prior year. The reduced cash flows for accounts receivable was primarily due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, which were $81.7 million higher than the comparable prior year period, and timing of customer payments. The increase in inventory was due primarily to a higher backlog, which increased $154.4 million compared to the prior year.\nIn February 2017, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from its IPO to repay loans under the ABL Facility.\napproximately $183.0 million of our current backlog will not be produced and sold within the next 12 months following October 31, 2017.\nOn December 19, 2017, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share on our common stock, payable in respect of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The dividend is payable on February 28, 2018 to holders of record as of January 28, 2018. Subject to legally available funds and the discretion of our board of directors, we expect to pay a quarterly cash dividend at the rate of $0.05 per share on our common stock. We expect to pay this quarterly dividend on or about the last day of the first month following each fiscal quarter to shareholders of record on the last day of such fiscal quarter. Our dividend policy has certain risks and limitations, particularly with respect to liquidity, and we may not pay dividends according to our policy, or at all. We cannot assure you that we will declare dividends or have sufficient funds to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts billed and currently due from customers. We extend credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments. Management determines the allowance for uncollectible accounts by evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer's financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. Each fiscal quarter, we prepare an analysis of our ability to collect outstanding receivables that provides a basis for an allowance estimate for uncollectible accounts. In connection with this analysis, we evaluate the age of accounts receivable, past collection history, current financial conditions of key customers and economic conditions.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Commercial segment Adjusted EBITDA was $53.4 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $14.3 million, or 36.6%, from $39.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased average realized pricing and lower material costs, as well as lower selling, general and administrative expenses, which was partially offset by reduced unit volume compared to the prior year.\nFor the past several years, a significant component of our growth has been the addition of businesses or business units through acquisitions. We typically incur upfront costs as we integrate acquired businesses and implement our operating philosophy at newly acquired companies, including consolidation of supplies and materials, changes to production processes at acquired facilities to implement manufacturing improvements and other restructuring initiatives. The benefits of these integration efforts may not positively impact our financial results until subsequent periods. Operational and financial integration of our recently acquired businesses could be ongoing.\n (d) Reflects expenses associated with stock-based compensation. For fiscal year 2017, stock-based compensation expense included $13.3 million for the remeasurement of liability awards to our IPO share price, $8.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of liability awards and stock options resulting from our IPO and $3.3 million related to the redemption of performance based stock options. For the fiscal year 2016, stock-based compensation expense included $10.3 million related to the redemption of performance based stock options. For fiscal year 2016, stock-based compensation expense included $10.3 million for the accelerated vesting of stock options held by former employees, which were subsequently redeemed for cash. Approximately $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for fiscal year 2016 related to the non-cash remeasurement of outstanding liability awards to fair value. The remeasurement of the liability awards was required as a result of the Company becoming a public entity after the filing with the SEC in connection with its IPO. The remaining stock-based compensation expense of $2.9 million for fiscal year 2016 was a non-cash charge for stock options vesting on their normal vesting schedule that were not repurchased by us as described above. We do not expect that such accelerated vesting, the remeasurement of outstanding liability awards and repurchase of outstanding stock options will be an ongoing cost following our IPO. For this reason, we expect substantially all of our future stock-based compensation expense to be a non-cash expense that follows a normal vesting schedule. \n (c) In fiscal year 2017, the Company restructured some of its management functions in its Commercial segment and in its Corporate office and incurred personnel costs, including severance and other employee benefit payments of approximately $1.5 million. At October 31, 2017, a balance of $0.6 million of these restructuring costs remained unpaid. ", "item_7_text": "Selling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were $188.3 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $48.5 million, or 34.7%, from $139.8 million for fiscal year 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 8.3% and 7.3% for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to expenses from acquired companies, increased stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO and higher employee payroll and benefit costs compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2017 included $26.6 million of stock-based compensation expense. Fiscal year 2017 stock-based compensation expense is made up of $13.3 million for the remeasurement of liability awards to our IPO share price, $8.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of liability awards and stock options resulting from the completion of our IPO and $3.3 million related to the redemption of performance-based stock options.\nNet Sales. Recreation segment net sales were $659.8 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $181.8 million, or 38.0%, from $478.1 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in net sales was due to an increase in organic unit volume and average selling prices as well as the impact of acquired companies. The increase in organic unit volume was due to an increase in both Class A and Class C units sold for fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior year. The increase in average selling prices was due to an improved mix of sales, compared to the prior year, as well as strategic pricing initiatives. Net sales from acquired companies were $112.6 million for fiscal year 2017. Excluding the impact of net sales from acquired companies, Recreation segment net sales increased 14.5% compared to the prior year.\nDue to the customized nature of many of our products and customer contracts, other costs for new product development are incurred and realized as a component of cost of sales.\nNet Sales. Recreation segment net sales were $478.1 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $65.1 million, or 15.8%, from $412.9 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in net sales was due primarily to an increase in Class A diesel and Class C units sold compared to the prior year due to greater end market demand and lower net sales from the intentional slowdown in production in the prior year. This was partially offset by fewer units sold of Class A gas models compared to the prior year.\n (b) Reflects the reimbursement of expenses to AIP, the Company's primary equity holder. \nApril 2017 ABL Facility\n (g) Income tax effect of adjustments using a 36.5% effective income tax rate for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, except for certain transaction expenses. \nAdjusted EBITDA. Recreation segment Adjusted EBITDA was $11.0 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $9.5 million, or 630.3%, from $1.5 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in unit volume, benefits from procurement initiatives and lower sales discounting, partially offset by the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales due to product mix and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nWorking capital at October 31, 2017 (defined as current assets (excluding cash) minus current liabilities (excluding current portion of long-term debt) was $299.7 million compared to $187.3 million at October 29, 2016. The increase in working capital was primarily due to incremental working capital from companies acquired in the current year, as well as an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior year fourth quarter, and a corresponding increase in inventory to support an anticipated growth in sales.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nAdjusted EBITDA. Fire & Emergency segment Adjusted EBITDA was $109.5 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $24.3 million, or 28.5%, from $85.2 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased net sales from KME and Ferrara, mix shift toward higher content fire apparatus and modular ambulance vehicles, and operational improvements, including lower material costs and manufacturing cost reductions, and strategic pricing initiatives. These Adjusted EBITDA increases were partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from acquired companies. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Fire & Emergency segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 21.0% compared to the prior year.\nOur business is impacted by the U.S. economic environment, employment levels, consumer confidence, municipal spending, changes in interest rates and instability in securities markets around the world, among other factors. In particular, changes in the U.S. economic climate can impact demand in key end markets.\nProvisions for estimated warranty and other related costs are recorded in cost of sales and are periodically adjusted to reflect actual experience. The amount of accrued warranty liability reflects management's best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring our obligations under our limited warranty plans. The costs of fulfilling our warranty obligations principally involve replacement parts, labor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit or recall campaigns. Our estimates are based on historical experience, the number of units involved and the cost per claim. Also, each quarter we review actual warranty claims to determine if there are systemic effects that would require a field retrofit or recall campaign.\nRestructuring. Consolidated restructuring costs were $3.5 million for fiscal year 2016, compared to $3.9 million in fiscal year 2015. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a plan to relocate production of Goshen Coach buses from its Elkhart, Indiana facility to its facilities in Salina, Kansas and Imlay City, Michigan and the relocation of our mobility van production from Salina, Kansas to Longview, Texas.\n (f) Includes prepayment premiums and write-offs of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount recognized upon the redemption of our Notes in February 2017, as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the Company's previous revolving credit facility as a result of the Company's ABL refinancing in April 2017. \nWarranty\nContractual Obligations\nWe recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, expirations due to statutes, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual.\nNet Income. Consolidated net income was $30.2 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $7.3 million, or 32.0% from $22.9 million for fiscal year 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $122.8 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $32.7 million, or 36.3%, from $90.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, offset partially by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are useful to investors and are used by our management for measuring profitability because these measures exclude the impact of certain items which we believe have less bearing on our core operating performance because they are items that are not needed or available to the Company's managers in the daily activities of their businesses. We believe that the core operations of our business are those which can be affected by our management in a particular period through their resource allocation decisions that affect the underlying performance of our specialty vehicle operations conducted during that period. We also believe that decisions utilizing Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income allow for a more meaningful comparison of operating fundamentals between companies within our markets by eliminating the impact of capital structure and taxation differences between the companies. To determine Adjusted EBITDA, we further adjust net income for the following items: non-cash depreciation and amortization, interest expense and benefit for income taxes. Stock-based compensation expense is excluded from both Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA because it is an expense that is measured based upon external inputs such as our current share price and the movement of share price of peer companies, which cannot be impacted by our business managers. Stock-based compensation expense also reflects a cost which may obscure trends in our underlying vehicle businesses for a given period, due to the timing and nature of the equity awards.\nRecreation - Our Recreation segment serves the RV market through six principal brands: American Coach, Fleetwood RV, Monaco Coach, Holiday Rambler, Renegade and Midwest. We believe our brand portfolio contains some of the longest standing, most recognized brands in the RV industry. Under these six brands, REV provides a variety of highly recognized models such as: American Eagle, Dynasty, Discovery, Bounder and Pace Arrow, among others. Our products in the Recreation segment include Class A motorized RVs (motorhomes built on a heavy duty chassis with either diesel or gas engine configurations), Class C and Super C\u201d motorized RVs (motorhomes built on a commercial truck or van chassis), a line of heavy-duty special application trailers, and, as a result of the acquisition of Midwest, Class B RVs (motorhomes built out on a van chassis). The Recreation segment also includes Goldshield Fiberglass, which produces a wide range of custom molded fiberglass products for the RV and broader industrial markets. In December 2016, we acquired Renegade RV, a leader in the Super C\u201d segment of the RV market and producer of a line of heavy-duty special application trailers. In April 2017, we acquired Midwest, a leading producer of Class B RVs and custom luxury vans.\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands):\nSenior Secured Notes\nImpact of Acquisitions\n (f) Reflects losses recognized upon the redemption of our Notes in February 2017. The Company paid a prepayment premium of $7.7 million and wrote off $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and $0.4 million of original issue discount. The loss on early extinguishment of debt also includes the write-off of $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of our debt re-financing in April 2017. \nIncome Taxes. Consolidated income tax expense was $18.7 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $5.6 million from $13.1 million expense for fiscal year 2016. The effective income tax rate was 37.3% and 30.2% for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively. The increase in the Company's effective income tax rate, relative to the prior fiscal year, relates primarily to a prior year beneficial adjustment to deferred income tax balances.\n\nResearch and Development. Consolidated research and development costs for fiscal year 2016 were $4.8 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 5.7% from $5.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The reduction was largely due to the timing and mix of product development programs and testing, with higher spending in fiscal year 2015 for a fully redesigned terminal truck that was introduced to the market in 2015 and for the development of new RV models introduced in 2015 and 2016.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit was $294.6 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $64.7 million, or 28.1% from $229.9 million for fiscal year 2016. Consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 13.0% and 11.9% for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively. The 105 basis points increase in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was due to the combination of higher net sales and lower cost of sales described above, as well as higher aftermarket parts sales volume in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016.\nGeneral Economic Conditions\n \u2022 our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \nNet Sales. Consolidated net sales were $2,267.8 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $341.8 million, or 17.7%, from $1,926.0 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in consolidated net sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales of $216.0 million and $181.8 million in the Fire & Emergency and Recreation segments, respectively, offset by a decrease in net sales of $58.9 million in the Commercial segment. The increase in Fire & Emergency segment net sales were due to $151.9 million of incremental net sales from acquired companies, higher ambulance and fire apparatus unit volumes, and higher average selling prices for both fire trucks and ambulances. The increase in net sales in the Recreation segment was primarily due to higher unit sales volumes of Class A and Class C vehicles, and $112.6 million of incremental net sales from acquired companies. The decrease in Commercial segment net sales was primarily due to lower shuttle bus unit volume compared to the prior year. Excluding net sales from acquired companies, net sales in fiscal year 2017 increased $76.3 million or 4.0% compared to the prior year.\nOn January 26, 2017, the Company announced an IPO of its common stock which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol REVG.\u201d On February 1, 2017, the Company completed the offering of 12,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $22.00 per share and the Company received approximately $275.0 million in gross proceeds from the IPO, or approximately $253.6 million in net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and expenses related to the IPO. The net proceeds of the IPO were used to redeem the entire outstanding balance of its Notes, including a prepayment premium and accrued interest, and partially pay down the then outstanding balance of its revolving credit facility.\nAdjusted Net Income. Consolidated Adjusted Net Income was $53.2 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $19.2 million, or 56.3% from $34.0 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted Net Income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, offset partially by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe Company has applied the qualitative method for its fiscal 2017 impairment test.\nIncome Taxes. Consolidated income tax expense was $13.1 million in fiscal year 2016, an increase of $1.1 million compared to $11.9 million in fiscal year 2015. The effective income tax rate was 30.2% and 34.3% for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The decrease in the Company's effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2016, relative to the prior fiscal year, related primarily to a discrete adjustment to deferred income tax balances. The adjustment was not material to the Company's current or previously issued financial statements.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $14.9 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to $9.4 million in fiscal year 2016. The increase in amortization expenses was due to the amortization of the intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of Renegade in December 2016, the acquisitions of Ferrara and Midwest in April 2017 and the acquisition of KME in April 2016. As a result of these acquisitions, the Company estimates future amortization expense for intangible assets to approximate $12.0 million in fiscal year 2018. This anticipated amortization expense may be adjusted in future periods pending the final completion of the detailed valuation of intangible assets acquired as a result of fiscal year 2017 acquisitions.\n \u2022 changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n\nNet Sales. Commercial segment net sales were $620.1 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $58.9 million, or 8.7%, from $679.0 million for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in net sales was due primarily to a decrease in the number of shuttle and school bus units sold compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher sales of transit buses and terminal trucks compared to the prior year. This was also partially offset by higher average realized pricing compared to the prior year due to sales mix and strategic pricing initiatives. Excluding the impact of net sales from acquired companies, Commercial segment net sales decreased 8.8% compared to the prior year.\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe nature and amount of such restructuring costs vary significantly based on the number of completed acquisitions and the size and timing of related and other restructuring programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items are useful to investors by supplementing the GAAP information with an additional measure that can be used to assess the Company's operating performance.\nREV is a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of specialty vehicles and related aftermarket parts and services. We provide customized vehicle solutions for applications including: essential needs (ambulances, fire apparatus, school buses, mobility vans and municipal transit buses), industrial and commercial (terminal trucks, cut-away buses and street sweepers) and consumer leisure (recreational vehicles RVs\u201d and luxury buses). Our brand portfolio consists of 29 well-established principal vehicle brands including many of the most recognizable names within our served markets. Several of our brands pioneered their specialty vehicle product categories and date back more than 50 years. We believe that in most of our markets, we hold the first or second market share position and approximately 63% of our net sales during fiscal year 2017 came from products where we believe we hold such share positions.\nLong-Lived Assets, Including Definite-Lived Intangibles\nFire & Emergency Segment\nStock Compensation Expense\n\nAcquisitions are accounted for using purchase accounting. The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business, in each case based on their estimated fair values. Any excess consideration transferred is recorded as goodwill. A bargain purchase gain is recognized to the extent the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase price. The results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition.\n (d) Reflects expenses associated with stock-based compensation. For fiscal year 2017, stock-based compensation expense includes $13.3 million for the remeasurement of liability awards to our IPO share price, $8.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of liability awards and stock options resulting from the completion of our IPO and $3.3 million was related to the redemption of performance based stock options. For fiscal year 2016, stock-based compensation expense includes $10.3 million related to the redemption of performance based stock options. We do not expect that such accelerated vesting, the remeasurement of outstanding liability awards and repurchase of outstanding stock options will be an ongoing cost following completion our IPO. For this reason, following the completion of our IPO, we expect substantially all of our stock-based compensation expense to be a non-cash expense that follows a normal vesting schedule. \nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2016 was $14.7 million, which primarily consisted of net borrowings from our previous ABL facility, offset partially by $21.7 million of payments to redeem common stock and common stock options and the repayment of debt assumed in the Hall-Mark Acquisition.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses in fiscal year 2017 were $188.3 million which is an increase of $48.5 million compared to fiscal year 2016. This increase was primarily due to additional SG&A expenses from acquired companies and higher stock compensation expense related to our IPO.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2017 was $202.9 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from our IPO offset by the use of those proceeds to redeem our Notes, and further net borrowings from the April 2017 ABL Facility and Term Loan to support acquisitions and working capital requirements.\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of operational and financial measures. These measures include net sales, units sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income. In assessing segment performance, our chief executive officer, as the chief operating decision maker, analyzes the primary financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA.\nIn considering the financial performance of the business, management analyzes the primary financial performance measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income for the relevant period before depreciation and amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes, as adjusted for certain items described below that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income, as adjusted for certain items described below that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor Adjusted Net Income is a measure defined by GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income is net income for the relevant period.\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted Net Income for the periods presented (in thousands):\n (f) Reflects losses recognized upon the redemption of our Notes in February 2017. The Company paid a prepayment premium of $7.7 million and wrote off $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and $0.4 million of original issue discount. The loss on early extinguishment of debt also includes the write-off of $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of our debt re-financing in April 2017. \nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2015 was $17.6 million, which primarily consisted of net repayments of our revolving credit facility and payments to redeem common stock and common stock options, offset partially by the net proceeds from sales of our common stock.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\n\nIf the fair value of any reporting unit, as calculated using the income approach, is less than its carrying value, the fair value of the implied goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill. An impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value for each reporting unit.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2016 was $84.4 million, which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $48.5 million and $31.7 million of payments for the acquisition of KME.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our consolidated financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, future results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nBased on this evaluation, we establish a reserve for specific accounts receivable that are believed to be uncollectible, as well as an estimate of uncollectible receivables not specifically known. Historical trends and our current knowledge of potential collection problems provide us with sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for an allowance for uncollectible accounts. Receivables are written off when management determines collection is highly unlikely and collection efforts have ceased. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Recreation segment Adjusted EBITDA was $36.2 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $25.2 million, or 229.1%, from $11.0 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in gross profit offset partially by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in gross profit was due to higher unit sales volumes, lower cost of materials, lower cost of quality as a percentage of sales, higher average selling prices resulting from product mix, and the impact of acquired companies. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to expenses from acquired companies. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Recreation segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 136.7% compared to the prior year.\nGross profit and gross margin percentage were $294.6 million and 13.0%, respectively, in fiscal year 2017, which were $64.7 million and 105 basis points higher than in fiscal year 2016. These improvements in gross profit and gross margin percentage were due to realized benefits from higher sales (including parts), our ongoing materials sourcing initiatives, a more profitable mix of sales in our Fire & Emergency segment, lower cost of quality and strategic pricing actions.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, the Company paid cash dividends of $6.4 million.\nInterest expense was $20.7 million in fiscal year 2017, which is a decrease of $8.4 million compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The decrease in interest expense was due to the impact of debt reduction from our IPO and our debt refinancing in April 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNet Income. Consolidated net income was $31.4 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $1.2 million, or 3.9% from net income of $30.2 million for fiscal year 2016.\n\nRestructuring. Consolidated restructuring costs were $4.5 million for fiscal year 2017, compared to $3.5 million in fiscal year 2016. Restructuring costs in fiscal year 2017 represent costs incurred to restructure some of the Company's management functions in the Commercial segment and in our Corporate office, which consisted of personnel costs, including severance and other employee benefit payments. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a plan to relocate production of Goshen Coach buses from its Elkhart, Indiana facility to its facilities in Salina, Kansas and Imlay City, Michigan and the relocation of our mobility van production facility from Salina, Kansas to Longview, Texas.\n\n\nCommercial Segment\nOn April 25, 2017, the Company entered into a $75.0 million term loan ( Term Loan\u201d or Term Loan Agreement\u201d), as Borrower, with certain subsidiaries of the Company as Guarantor Subsidiaries. Principal may be prepaid at any time during the term of the Term Loan without penalty. The Company incurred $2.0 million in debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan. The Term Loan Agreement expires on April 25, 2022.\n (b) Reflects the reimbursement of expenses to AIP, the Company's primary equity holder. \nAs a result of our IPO, outstanding stock options which had previously been recorded as a liability on the Company's balance sheet were reclassified to permanent equity. On the date of the IPO, vesting of 846,000 of these liability awards were accelerated, and there were 1,528,000 of vested liability option awards. All liability option awards were re-measured at fair value based upon the IPO offering price of $22.00 per share. Also as a result of the IPO, the Company recorded stock compensation expense of $13.3 million due to the change in fair value of the liability option awards and $8.9 million due to stock options which immediately vested.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nFire & Emergency Segment\nCost of Sales. Consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 87.0% for fiscal year 2017 as compared to 88.1% for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in consolidated cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily due to net reductions in the costs of materials resulting from specific sourcing initiatives, lower cost of quality, and the benefits of higher production volumes. In addition, cost of sales in fiscal year 2017 were lower as a percent of net sales due to strategic pricing initiatives for certain vehicle classes.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit was $229.9 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $48.0 million, or 26.4% from $182.0 million for fiscal year 2015. Consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 11.9% and 10.5% for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The increase in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was due to the combination of higher net sales and lower cost of sales described above.\nCommercial - Our Commercial segment serves the bus market through the following principal brands: Collins Bus, Goshen Coach, ENC, ElDorado National, Krystal Coach, Federal Coach, Champion and World Trans. We serve the terminal truck market through the Capacity brand, the sweeper market through the Lay-Mor brand and the mobility van market through our recently recast Revability brand. We are a leading producer of small- and medium-sized buses, Type A school buses, transit buses, terminal trucks and street sweepers in the United States. Our products in the Commercial segment include cut-away buses (customized body built on various types and sizes of commercial chassis), transit buses (large municipal buses where we build our own chassis and body), luxury buses (bus-style limo or high-end luxury conversions), street sweepers (three- and four-wheel versions used in road construction activities), terminal trucks (specialized vehicle which moves freight in warehouses or intermodal yards and ports), Type A school buses (small school bus built on commercial chassis), and mobility vans (mini-van converted to be utilized by wheelchair passengers). Within each market segment, we produce a large number of customized configurations to address the diverse needs of our customers.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as analytical tools. These are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP, nor are they measures of financial condition and they should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net loss for the period determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, such measures do not reflect:\nOur recent operating results reflect the impact of our ongoing initiatives to lower our operating costs to expand our profit margins. Purchased materials, including chassis, represent our largest component of costs of sales. We operate a centralized strategic procurement organization dedicated to reducing our overall level of materials spend across our three segments, while simplifying and standardizing suppliers and parts. Reduction in our cost of quality is also a major enterprise-wide focus. We share best practices and manage improvement initiatives from a central operations team as well as at the individual business unit level.\nWe serve a diversified customer base primarily in the United States through the following segments:\nThe nature and amount of such restructuring costs vary significantly based on the number of completed acquisitions and the size and timing of related and other restructuring programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items are useful to investors by supplementing the GAAP information with an additional measure that can be used to assess the Company's operating performance.\nOn April 25, 2017, the Company entered into a new $350.0 million ABL revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the April 2017 ABL Facility\u201d). The April 2017 ABL Facility provides for revolving loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $350.0 million. The total April 2017 ABL Facility is subject to a $30.0 million sublimit for swing line loans and a $35.0 million sublimit for letters of credit, along with certain borrowing base and other customary restrictions as defined in the April 2017 ABL Agreement. The April 2017 ABL Facility expires on April 25, 2022.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\u201d ( ASU 2015-17\u201d), which simplifies the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the classified balance sheet, rather than separating such deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We prospectively adopted ASU 2015-17 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and therefore prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Consolidated amortization of intangible assets was $14.9 million for fiscal year 2017, compared to $9.4 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in amortization expense was due to the amortization of the intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of KME in April 2016, Renegade in December 2016 and Midwest and Ferrara in April 2017.\nOverview\nEach of our three segments has a backlog of new vehicle orders that generally extends out from two to twelve months in duration. Our businesses take orders from our dealers and end customers that are evidenced by a firm purchase order for delivery of one or many specialty vehicles and parts with a given specification over a period of time. These firm orders are placed in our backlog and reported at the aggregate selling prices, net of discounts or allowances, at the time the purchase order is received. We do not include verbal commitments or promised orders in our reported backlog. For fiscal year 2017, our backlog was $1,101.6 million compared to $857.3 million in fiscal year 2016. The increase in Fire & Emergency and Recreation backlogs were partially due to the current year acquisitions of Ferrara, Renegade and Midwest. In addition, our Commercial segment backlog at October 31, 2017 includes a portion of a large transit bus order that is expected to begin delivering in early fiscal year 2019. We expect that\nUnder the quantitative method, the fair value of each reporting unit of the Company is determined by using the income approach and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The income approach involves discounting management's projections of future cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a discount rate which approximates the Company's weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d). Key assumptions used in the income approach include future sales growth, gross margin and operating expenses trends, depreciation expense, taxes, capital expenditures and changes in working capital. Projected future cash flows are based on income forecasts and management's knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. The WACC incorporates equity and debt return rates observed in the market for a group of comparable public companies in the industry, and is determined using an average debt to equity ratio of selected comparable public companies, and is also adjusted for risk premiums and the Company's capital structure. The terminal value is based upon the projected cash flow for the final projected year, and is calculated using estimates of growth of the net cash flows based on the Company's estimate of stable growth for each financial reporting unit. The inputs and assumptions used in the determination of fair value are considered Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\n (e) Reflects the amortization of the difference between the fair market and book value of certain acquired inventory which was sold. \n (d) Unrecognized tax benefits totaling $2.6 million as of October 31, 2017, excluding related interests and penalties, are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. See Note 17 to our 2017 audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K for disclosures regarding uncertain income tax positions under ASC Topic 740. \nFire & Emergency - The Fire & Emergency segment sells fire apparatus equipment under the Emergency One ( E-ONE\u201d), Kovatch Mobile Equipment ( KME\u201d) and Ferrara brands and ambulances under the American Emergency Vehicles ( AEV\u201d), Horton Emergency Vehicles ( Horton\u201d), Leader Emergency Vehicles ( Leader\u201d), Marque, McCoy Miller, Road Rescue, Wheeled Coach and Frontline brands. We believe we are the largest manufacturer by unit volume of fire and emergency vehicles in the United States and have one of the industry's broadest portfolios of products including Type I ambulances (aluminum body mounted on a heavy truck-style chassis), Type II ambulances (van conversion ambulance typically favored for non-emergency patient transportation), Type III ambulances (aluminum body mounted on a van-style chassis), pumpers (fire apparatus on a custom or commercial chassis with a water pump and small tank to extinguish fires), ladder trucks (fire apparatus with stainless steel or aluminum ladders), tanker trucks and rescue and other vehicles. Each of our individual brands is distinctly positioned and targets certain price and feature points in the market such that dealers often carry and customers often buy more than one REV Fire & Emergency product line. In April 2017, we acquired Ferrara Fire Apparatus, a leader in custom fire apparatus and rescue vehicles.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\n (c) In fiscal year 2017, the Company restructured some of its management functions in its Commercial segment and in its Corporate office and incurred personnel costs, including severance and other employee benefit payments of approximately $1.5 million. At October 31, 2017, a balance of $0.6 million of the restructuring costs remained unpaid. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a strategic plan to relocate production of Goshen buses to its Salina, KS and Imlay City, MI facilities. The Company recognized $3.0 million of costs associated with the relocation, including but not limited to personnel costs, severance and bonuses in fiscal year 2017, and $0.7 million of such costs were recognized in fiscal year 2016. \nRecreation Segment\nThe components of our selling, general and administrative expenses may not be identical to those of our competitors. As a result, data in this document regarding our operating and administrative expenses may not be comparable to similar expenses of our competitors. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as we grow our businesses and due to additional legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses we expect to incur as a result of being a public company.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were $139.8 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $37.5 million, or 36.6%, from $102.3 million for fiscal year 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 7.3% and 5.9% for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increased corporate and marketing expenses. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2016 included $19.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, of which $10.3 million pertains to the acceleration and repurchase of outstanding options from former employees and $6.5 million pertains to the remeasurement of outstanding liability awards to fair value, which were required to be recorded at fair value as a result of becoming a public entity after the filing of our Form S-1 with the SEC.\nPrior to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock was calculated by determining our enterprise value by applying an earnings multiple to our Adjusted EBITDA over the previous 12 months, and deducting outstanding debt, then dividing by the number of shares of common stock outstanding. The assumption for forfeitures is based upon historical experience. As we have not historically paid dividends on our common stock, we have previously assumed a 0% dividend rate for all outstanding stock options.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $162.5 million fiscal year 2017, an increase of $39.7 million or 32.3%, from $122.8 million in fiscal year 2016. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of acquisitions and higher net sales and gross profit from certain business segments described above. A detailed reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is included in the section -Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\u201d below.\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed generally include tangible and intangible assets, as well as contingent assets and liabilities. When available, the estimated fair values of these assets and liabilities are determined based on observable inputs, such as quoted market prices, information from comparable transactions, offers made by other prospective acquirers (in such cases where we may have certain rights to acquire additional interests in existing investments) and the replacement cost of assets in the same condition or stage of usefulness (Level 1 and 2). Unobservable inputs, such as expected future cash flows or internally developed estimates of value (Level 3), are used if observable inputs are not available.\nCash Flow\nIn April 2017, the Company repaid all outstanding loans and obligations under the ABL Facility in full, and the ABL Facility was terminated.\nThe below table of material debt and lease commitments at October 31, 2017 summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods as set forth in the table below.\nThe Company accounts for business combinations by estimating the fair value of consideration paid for acquired businesses, including contingent consideration, and assigning that amount to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the remainder assigned to goodwill. If the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the fair value of consideration paid, a gain on bargain purchase is recognized. The estimates of fair values are determined utilizing customary valuation procedures and techniques, which require us, among other things, to estimate future cash flows and discount rates. Such analyses involve significant judgments and estimations.\n (e) Reflects the amortization of the difference between the book value and fair market value of certain acquired inventory that was subsequently sold after the acquisition date. \n (c) In fiscal year 2017, the Company restructured some of its management functions in its Commercial segment and in its Corporate office and incurred personnel costs, including severance and other employee benefit payments of approximately $1.5 million. At October 31, 2017, a balance of $0.6 million of these restructuring costs remained unpaid. \n stock options will be an ongoing cost following completion of our IPO. For this reason, we expect substantially all of our stock-based compensation expense to be a non-cash expense that follows a normal vesting schedule. \nKey Performance Indicators\nCost of Sales. Consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 88.1% for fiscal year 2016 as compared to 89.5% for fiscal year 2015. The decrease in consolidated cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily due to a decrease in cost of sales in the Fire & Emergency and Commercial segments, offset by an increase in cost of sales in the Recreation segment. The aggregate reduction in cost of sales for the Company was due to the enterprise-wide implementation of strategic price increases, net reductions in the costs of materials resulting from specific sourcing initiatives, and the benefits of higher unit sales volumes.\nCustomer advances include amounts received in advance of the completion of vehicles or in advance of services being rendered. Such customer advances are recorded as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet until the vehicle is shipped or the service rendered.\nOur units represent a wide range of products at various price points, with higher value-added units at higher price points typically resulting in higher gross margins. Additionally, large orders of similar units typically provide operational efficiencies that contribute to higher gross margins. As such, our management also utilizes unit volume sales mix to analyze the performance of our business.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The amendments in this update require, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of leases with a duration of less than 12 months) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We expect to adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 to our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, excluding interest expense; and \nPrincipal may be repaid at any time during the term of the April 2017 ABL Facility without penalty.\n\nAdjusted Net Income. Consolidated Adjusted net income in fiscal year 2017 was $75.9 million, which is a 42.7% increase over $53.2 million in fiscal year 2016.\nWe believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy, cash dividends and additional expenses we expect to incur as a public company. However, we cannot assure you that our cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the April 2017 ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and if availability under the April 2017 ABL Facility is not sufficient due to the size of our borrowing base or other external factors, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nStock compensation expense is recorded over the agreed upon vesting term of the associated stock option grants, and is measured based upon the estimation of the fair value of all stock option awards on the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model (the Black-Scholes Model\u201d). The application of the Black-Scholes Model requires us to make certain assumptions such as the fair value of our common stock on the grant date, forfeitures of option grants and the rate of dividend payments on our common stock. Other assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes Model include volatility of the share price of select peer public companies and the risk free rate.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements\u201d ( ASU 2015-15\u201d), which clarifies the guidance set forth in ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), issued in April 2015. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. ASU 2015-15 provides additional guidance regarding debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, stating that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-03 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 (the Company's fiscal year 2017), and early adoption was permitted. In fiscal year 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 and debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability for all periods presented. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 did not have a material effect our consolidated financial statements.\nSegments\n\nNet Sales and Units Sold\nWe also adjust for exceptional items which are determined to be those that in management's judgment need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, which include non-cash items and items settled in cash. In determining whether an event or transaction is exceptional, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence. This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to our Board of Directors, assists in providing a meaningful analysis of our operating performance and used as a measurement in incentive compensation for management. Based on the foregoing factors, management considers the adjustment for non-cash purchase accounting to be an exceptional item.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)\u201d ( ASU 2016-09\u201d), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for the related income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company's fiscal year 2018), including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 to our consolidated financial statements is dependent upon the Company's share price, income tax rates and the timing of stock option exercises.\nTerm Loan\nResults of Operations\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are the primary metrics we use to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our markets. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are useful performance measures and we use them to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, we also utilize the metric of Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales as a complimentary measurement of performance among our businesses and versus our competitors. We also use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income as primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain compensation programs and plans for employees, including our senior executives.\nOur primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, inventory management, acquiring machinery and equipment, acquiring and building manufacturing facilities, the improvement and expansion of existing manufacturing facilities, debt service payments, regular quarterly dividend payments, and general corporate needs. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Company recognized $2.8 million of costs associated with this re-organization and office relocation, which included severance, lease termination and other associated expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\nNet income was $31.4 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to net income of $30.2 million in fiscal year 2016. Adjusted Net Income in fiscal year 2017 was $75.9 million, which is a 42.7% increase over $53.2 million in fiscal year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Fire & Emergency segment Adjusted EBITDA was $85.2 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $21.9 million, or 34.5%, from $63.3 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased average realized pricing, procurement initiatives and other operational improvements, as well as increased net sales from the acquired KME and the Hall-Mark businesses, which was partially offset by reduced units shipped compared to the prior year and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n (b) Based on interest rates in effect as of October 31, 2017. \nIn accordance with GAAP, we recognize acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. This includes the recognition of identified intangible assets and goodwill which, in the case of definite-life intangible assets, are then amortized over their expected useful lives, which typically results in an increase in amortization expense. In addition, assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally include tangible assets, as well as contingent assets and liabilities.\nInterest Expense. Consolidated interest expense was $29.2 million and $27.3 million for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. The increase in consolidated interest expense was due primarily to additional interest expense from our revolving credit facility, which was primarily due to higher borrowings for capital expenditures and business acquisitions compared to the prior year.\n (d) Reflects expenses associated with stock-based compensation. For fiscal year 2017, stock-based compensation expense includes $13.3 million for the remeasurement of liability awards to our IPO share price, $8.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of liability awards and stock options resulting from the completion of our IPO and $3.3 million was related to the redemption of performance based stock options. Approximately $6.5 million of stock-based compensation for fiscal year 2016 related to the non-cash remeasurement of outstanding liability awards to fair value. The remeasurement of the liability awards was required as a result of the Company becoming a public entity after the filing of its Form S-1 with the SEC. The remaining stock-based compensation expense of $2.9 million for fiscal year 2016 was normal vesting. Except for the additional non-cash stock compensation expense which was recognized concurrently with the immediate vesting of stock options as a result of our IPO, we do not expect that such accelerated vesting, the remeasurement of outstanding liability awards and repurchase of outstanding \n (a) Reflects costs incurred in connection with business acquisitions and offerings of our common stock. \nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nA decrease in employment levels, consumer confidence or the availability of financing, or other adverse economic events, or the failure of actual demand for our products to meet our estimates, could negatively affect the demand for our products. Any decline in overall customer demand in markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805)-Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\u201d ( ASU 2015-16\u201d). ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer in a business combination recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, rather than as retrospective adjustments. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 (the Company's fiscal year 2017), including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2015-16 was applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of ASU 2015-16 with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOctober 2013 ABL Facility\nStock compensation expense for restricted and performance stock awards is recorded over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The grant date fair value is equal to the closing share price on the date of grant.\nNet Sales. Fire & Emergency segment net sales were $984.0 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $216.0 million, or 28.1%, from $768.1 million for fiscal year 2016. Net sales of fire apparatus increased $176.9 million due primarily to sales from acquired companies and increased fire apparatus and ambulance units sold in our legacy businesses. In fiscal year 2017, we had incremental net sales of $151.9 million from KME and Ferrara, which were acquired in April 2016 and April 2017. Net sales of ambulance units increased $39.1 million compared to the prior year due to an increased mix of higher content vehicles and an increase in units sold. Excluding the impact of net sales from acquired companies, Fire & Emergency segment net sales increased 8.3% compared to the prior year.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. This standard will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. Under the new standard, entities are required to identify the contract with a customer, identify the separate performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract and recognize the appropriate amount of revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies each performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (the Company's fiscal year 2019). We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nExcluding stock-based compensation expense, operating income increased by $17.2 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016.\nIn fiscal year 2017, our net sales were $2,267.8 million, which were $341.8 million, or 17.7%, greater than fiscal year 2016. This increase in net sales was due to increases in our Fire & Emergency and Recreation segments. In fiscal year 2018 we expect sales in our Fire & Emergency segment to increase at a rate slightly better than the sales percent increase for the overall company due to increased unit volume, as a result of the full year impact of the Ferrara Fire Apparatus ( Ferrara\u201d) acquisition, and strong end-market demand across both our fire and ambulance product lines. In our Commercial segment for fiscal year 2018, we expect net sales to increase at a rate below the net sales percent increase for the entire company. In our Recreation segment, we expect net sales to increase in fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017 at a rate better than the net sales percent increase for the overall company as a result of higher unit sales volume in both Class A and Class C RV units due to end market demand growth, continued growth in market share across both RV classes and as a result of the Renegade and Midwest Automotive Designs ( Midwest\u201d) acquisitions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2017 was $33.2 million, compared to $75.6 million for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in cash from operating activities for fiscal year 2017, compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in inventory, higher cash outflows for other liabilities and lower incoming customer advance payments, which was partially offset by an increase in current year income from operations and faster current year collections of accounts receivable.\n (e) Reflects the amortization of the difference between the book value and fair market value of certain acquired inventory that was subsequently sold after the acquisition date. \nCapital expenditures for fiscal year 2018, excluding any acquisitions, are estimated to be approximately $50 to $55 million.\nOn October 21, 2013, we entered into a $150.0 million senior secured asset based lending revolving credit and guaranty agreement (the Asset Based Lending ABL\u201d or the ABL Facility\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders. On April 22, 2016, we exercised our $50.0 million incremental commitment option under the ABL Facility in conjunction with the acquisition of KME. On August 19, 2016, we amended the ABL Facility to increase the commitment from $200.0 million to $300.0 million to provide flexibility and access to the suppressed borrowing base. All other terms and conditions of the ABL Facility remained unchanged.\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2017 of $229.1 million was primarily due to business acquisition activity and capital expenditures. In fiscal year 2017, the Company completed the acquisitions of Renegade, Midwest and Ferrara.\nCost Management Initiatives\n (c) Includes obligations under non-cancellable purchase orders for raw materials or chassis as of October 31, 2017. \nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP, nor are they measures of financial condition or liquidity and they should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or net income, respectively, for the period determined in accordance with GAAP.\nDiluted net income per common share was $0.50 in fiscal year 2017 compared to $0.58 in fiscal year 2016. Adjusted diluted net income per common share was $1.22 per share in fiscal year 2017, which is a 18.4% increase from $1.03 in fiscal year 2016 even with a greater number of weighted average shares outstanding in fiscal year 2017. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income is included in the section -Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\u201d below.\nRevenue Recognition\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a plan to relocate production of Goshen Coach buses from its Elkhart, Indiana facility to its facilities in Salina, Kansas and Imlay City, Michigan and the relocation of our mobility van production from Salina, Kansas to Longview, Texas. Additionally, costs incurred in the current year quarter consisted of personnel costs, including severance, vacation and other employee benefit payments.\n \u2022 the cash requirements to pay our taxes and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, excluding income tax expense. \nThe nature and amount of such restructuring costs vary significantly based on the number of completed acquisitions and the size and timing of related and other restructuring programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items are useful to investors by supplementing the GAAP information with an additional measure that can be used to assess the Company's operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $162.5 million for fiscal year 2017, an increase of $39.7 million, or 32.3%, from $122.8 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, resulting from higher net sales, lower manufacturing costs and the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased 19.1% for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016.\nNet Sales. Fire & Emergency segment net sales were $768.1 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $147.9 million, or 23.8%, from $620.2 million for fiscal year 2015. Net sales of fire apparatus increased $134.1 million compared to the prior year, due primarily to net sales of $97.2 million from KME, which was acquired in April 2016, net sales of $38.3 million from the acquisition of certain assets and assumed liabilities of Hall-Mark Fire Apparatus Inc. ( Hall-Mark\u201d and the Hall-Mark Acquisition\u201d) in November 2015, and a larger mix of higher content units from our legacy fire business. Net sales of ambulance units increased $13.8 million compared to the prior year due primarily to sales mix of higher content units, offset by lower unit volume. In addition, net sales across all Fire & Emergency products increased due to the implementation of strategic price increases for certain models and markets.\n (a) Includes estimated principal payments due under our Term Loan and the April 2017 ABL Facility as of October 31, 2017. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2015 was $15.6 million, which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $15.4 million.\nOffering of Common Stock\nAccounts Receivable\nThe higher cash outflows for other liabilities in fiscal year 2017, compared to the prior year was partially due to higher management incentive bonus payments made in the first quarter of the current year versus the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 related to the prior year performance. Also, cash outflows were higher due to the timing of income tax payments, which were $5.5 million greater in fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior year. The increase in inventory was due to increased sales volumes and the timing of vehicle production.\nWhen determining the fair value of indefinite-lived trade names, the Company uses the relief from royalty method which requires the determination of fair value based on if the Company was licensing the right to the trade name in exchange for a royalty fee. The Company utilizes the income approach to determine future revenues to which to apply a royalty rate. The royalty rate is based on research of industry and market data related to transactions involving the licensing of comparable intangible assets. In considering the value of trade names, the Company looks to relative age, consistent use, quality, expansion possibilities, relative profitability and relative market potential.\nCommercial Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\nSegment Reporting\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. With the exception of operating lease obligations, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures and capital resources. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\n\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\u201d ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). Under ASU 2015-11, entities should measure inventory that is not measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method, including inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out or average cost, at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company's fiscal year 2018), and is to be applied prospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n (a) Reflects costs incurred in connection with business acquisitions and offerings of our common stock. \nThe following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for each of the quarters in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods in accordance with GAAP. This data should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for a full year or any future period.\nThe April 2017 ABL Facility contains certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the ABL Facility as of October 31, 2017.\nBacklog\nSeasonality\nThe primary factors affecting our results of operations include:\n (a) Reflects costs incurred in connection with business acquisitions and offerings of our common stock. \nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of trade names, are not amortized, however, the Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that its carrying amount may not exceed its fair value. The annual impairment review is performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year based upon information and estimates available at that time. To perform the impairment testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of the Company's reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts as a basis for determining whether or not to perform the quantitative impairment test. Qualitative testing includes the evaluation of economic conditions, financial performance and other factors such as key events when they occur. The Company then estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and each indefinite-lived intangible asset not meeting the qualitative criteria and compares their fair values to their carrying values.\nImpact of Initial Public Offering\nNet Sales. Commercial segment net sales were $679.0 million for fiscal year 2016, a decrease of $22.9 million, or 3.3%, from $702.0 million for fiscal year 2015. The decrease in net sales was due primarily to a decrease in shuttle bus unit volume due to selective bid participation, partially offset by higher sales of Type A school buses and transit buses compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by higher average realized pricing compared to the prior year.\nIn a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically the slowest quarters have been the first and second fiscal quarters when the purchasing seasons for vehicles such as school buses, RVs and sweepers are the lowest due to the colder weather and the relatively long time until summer vacation season, and the school year is underway with municipalities and school bus contractors utilizing their existing fleets to transport student populations. Sales of our products have typically been higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters (with the fourth fiscal quarter typically being the strongest) due to better weather, the vacation season, buying habits of RV dealers and end-users, timing of government/municipal customer fiscal years, and the beginning of a new school year. Sales and earnings for other vehicles that we produce, such as essential emergency vehicles and commercial bus fleets, are less seasonal, but fluctuations in sales of these vehicles can also be impacted by timing surrounding the fiscal years of municipalities and commercial customers, as well as the timing and amounts of multi-unit larger orders. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-Some of the markets in which we compete are seasonal, which results in fluctuations in sales and results of operations.\u201d\nResearch and Development. Consolidated research and development costs were $4.2 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 12.4% from $4.8 million for fiscal year 2016.\nStock Compensation Expense\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Consolidated amortization of intangible assets was $9.4 million for fiscal year 2016, compared to $8.6 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in amortization expenses was due primarily to the amortization of the additional intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of KME in April 2016.\nWe account for income taxes under the guidance of Accounting Standard Codification 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for which utilization is not more likely than not. Management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\nPrior to our IPO, our stockholders were party to a shareholders agreement that was amended and restated in its entirety as a result of the IPO. That previous shareholders agreement provided for, among other things, an employee stockholder to sell their stock back to the Company when he or she is terminated by the Company without cause or for good reason, death, disability, retirement or dissolution. This provision required us to recognize the value of these outstanding shares as temporary equity in our consolidated balance sheet, with changes in the fair value recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. The aforementioned rights of the employee stockholder to sell his or her shares of common stock lapsed upon completion of our IPO and, at that time, those outstanding shares which were held by an employee were reclassified to shareholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the IPO, the fair value of our common stock held by employees subject to the previous shareholders agreement was $35.4 million, which was reclassified to additional paid in capital on the Company's consolidated balance sheet on the IPO date.\nOn February 16, 2017, we redeemed in full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes ( Notes\u201d) with a portion of the proceeds from the IPO. The Company paid a prepayment premium of $7.7 million and accrued interest of $4.5 million as of the redemption date.\nCapital expenditures were $54.0 million in fiscal year 2017, and were primarily comprised of expenditures for manufacturing facility equipment and improvements, new product tooling, our ongoing ERP system implementation, and the continued rollout of our online parts sales infrastructure.\nWhile less economically sensitive than the Recreation segment and our terminal truck business, our Fire & Emergency segment and the remainder of the Commercial segment are also impacted by the overall economic environment. Local tax revenues are an important source of funding for fire and emergency response departments. Reduced municipal tax revenues resulting from the 2008 recession led to a decline in these markets. As fire and emergency products and buses are typically a larger cost item for municipalities and their service life is relatively long, their purchase is more deferrable, which can result in reduced demand for our products.\nPrior to our IPO, our stockholders were party to a shareholders agreement that was amended and restated in its entirety. Due to provisions in that shareholders agreement, employee shareholders were allowed to put his or her shares to us under certain circumstances. As such, certain outstanding stock options were considered liability awards and were recorded at fair value and recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. As a result of our IPO, the aforementioned put rights expired and the outstanding options were no longer considered liability awards and the fair value of the options have been reclassified to additional paid-in capital.\nThe following table shows summary cash flows for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nAdjusted EBITDA. Commercial segment Adjusted EBITDA was $50.5 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 5.4%, from $53.4 million for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to reduced shuttle bus unit volume compared to the prior year, which was offset by lower material costs, increased average realized pricing, and a shift in sales mix toward transit buses and terminal trucks as a percentage of total segment sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Commercial segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.8% compared to the prior year.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nIncome Taxes\nFor purposes of business segment performance measurement, we do not allocate to individual business segments costs or items that are of a non-operating nature or organizational or functional expenses of a corporate nature. The caption Corporate and Other\u201d includes corporate office expenses, including stock-based compensation, results of insignificant operations, intersegment eliminations and income and expenses not allocated to reportable segments. Identifiable assets of the business segments exclude general corporate assets, which principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, certain property, plant and equipment and certain other assets pertaining to corporate and other centralized activities.\nWe evaluate net sales and units sold because it helps us measure the impact of economic trends, the effectiveness of our marketing, the response of customers to new product launches and model changes, and the effect of competition over a given period. We recognize revenue for sales of completed vehicles upon shipment or delivery and acceptance by the dealer or customer as specified by the relevant dealer or customer purchase order.\nGeneral\nCapital Expenditures\nFunds from the April 2017 ABL Facility were used to repay borrowings on the previous ABL Facility and to fund the Ferrara acquisition.\n (b) Reflects the reimbursement of expenses to AIP, the Company's primary equity holder. \nProperty, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an analysis is necessitated by the occurrence of a triggering event, we compare the carrying amount of the asset group with the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group with its estimated fair value. Such analyses necessarily involve significant judgments and estimations on our part.\nWe recognize revenue for sales of vehicles, parts and other finished products when contract terms are met, collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer. In certain instances, risk of ownership and title passes when the product has been completed in accordance with purchase order specifications and has been tendered for delivery to the customer. Periodically, certain customers request bill and hold transactions. In those cases, revenue recognition for vehicles occurs after the customer has been notified that the products have been completed according to the customer specifications, have passed all of our quality control inspections, and are ready for delivery.\nInterest Expense. Consolidated interest expense was $20.7 million for fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 28.8% from $29.2 million for fiscal year 2016, respectively. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the repayment of our Notes in February 2017 with net proceeds from our IPO and the impact of our debt refinancing in April 2017.\nRV purchases are discretionary in nature and therefore sensitive to the availability of financing, consumer confidence, unemployment levels, levels of disposable income and changing levels of consumer home equity, among other factors. The 2008 recession caused consumers to reduce their discretionary spending, which negatively affected sales volumes for RVs. Terminal truck sales volumes are also impacted by economic conditions and industrial output, as these factors impact our end-market customers for these products, which include shipping ports, trucking/distribution hubs and rail terminal operators. Although RV and terminal truck sales have increased in recent years, these markets are affected by general U.S. and global economic conditions, which create risks that future economic downturns will further reduce consumer demand and negatively impact our sales.\nBusiness Combinations\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $11.9 million for fiscal year 2017, which includes losses recognized upon the redemption of our Notes in February 2017 and our April 2017 re-financing. The Company paid a prepayment premium of $7.7 million and wrote off $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and $0.4 million of original issue discount resulting from the redemption of our Notes. Loss on early extinguishment of debt also includes the write-off of $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of our debt re-financing in April 2017.\nRevenue from service agreements is recognized as earned when services are rendered. Intercompany sales are eliminated upon consolidation. Provisions are made for discounts, returns and sales allowances based on management's best estimate and the historical experience of each business unit. Sales are recorded net of amounts invoiced for taxes imposed on the customer, such as excise or value-added taxes.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company restructured some of its management functions in the Fire & Emergency segment and initiated the relocation of its Corporate office from Orlando, Florida to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented a plan to relocate production of Goshen Coach buses from its Elkhart, Indiana facility to its facilities in Salina, Kansas and Imlay City, Michigan and the relocation of our mobility van production from Salina, Kansas to Longview, Texas. Additionally, costs incurred in the current year quarter consisted of personnel costs, including severance, vacation and other employee benefit payments.\nLong-term debt, excluding current maturities, at October 31, 2017 was $229.1 million compared to $256.0 million at October 29, 2016. Long-term debt decreased primarily due to the use of net proceeds from our IPO to redeem our Notes and partially pay down the outstanding balance on our revolving credit, offset by the increase in working capital described above, increased borrowings to fund the acquisitions of Renegade, Midwest and Ferrara and capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017.\nNet Sales. Consolidated net sales were $1,926.0 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $190.9 million, or 11.0%, from $1,735.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in consolidated net sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales of $147.9 million and $65.1 million in the Fire & Emergency and Recreation segments, respectively, offset by a decrease in net sales of $22.9 million in the Commercial segment. Increases in Fire & Emergency segment net sales were due to higher fire apparatus volumes, $97.2 million of net sales from KME, which was acquired in April 2016, and higher average selling prices for both fire apparatus and ambulances. Higher net sales in the Recreation segment were due to higher unit sales volumes primarily in its Class A diesel products. Lower Commercial segment net sales were primarily due to lower shuttle bus units shipped during fiscal year 2016.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nWe evaluate our selling, general and administrative expenses in order to identify areas where we can further invest or create cost savings. Such investments or spending reductions could include items such as third-party services and cost of administrative processes. These expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, sales and marketing expenses, as well as other expenses associated with facilities unrelated to our manufacturing and supply chain network, internal management expenses and expenses for finance, information systems, legal, business development, human resources, purchasing and other administrative functions.\nBacklog represents orders received from dealers or directly from end customers. Backlog does not include purchase options or verbal orders. The following table presents a summary of our backlog by segment (in thousands):\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRecreation Segment\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2016 was $75.6 million compared to $25.6 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase in cash provided by activities was due to an increase in operating income in fiscal year 2016 as well as increased cash flows for accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by reduced cash flows for accounts receivable and inventories. Operating income increased $10.3 million, which was due to higher gross margin offset by increased corporate and marketing expenses. The increase in cash flows for accounts payable was due to timing of vendor payments. The increase in cash outflows for other liabilities was due to the timing of payments for payroll and related benefits and incentive compensation and income tax payments, as the Company's accruals for these expenses at the end of fiscal year 2016 were $20.5 million higher than the prior year. The reduced cash flows for accounts receivable was primarily due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, which were $81.7 million higher than the comparable prior year period, and timing of customer payments. The increase in inventory was due primarily to a higher backlog, which increased $154.4 million compared to the prior year.\nIn February 2017, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from its IPO to repay loans under the ABL Facility.\napproximately $183.0 million of our current backlog will not be produced and sold within the next 12 months following October 31, 2017.\nOn December 19, 2017, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share on our common stock, payable in respect of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The dividend is payable on February 28, 2018 to holders of record as of January 28, 2018. Subject to legally available funds and the discretion of our board of directors, we expect to pay a quarterly cash dividend at the rate of $0.05 per share on our common stock. We expect to pay this quarterly dividend on or about the last day of the first month following each fiscal quarter to shareholders of record on the last day of such fiscal quarter. Our dividend policy has certain risks and limitations, particularly with respect to liquidity, and we may not pay dividends according to our policy, or at all. We cannot assure you that we will declare dividends or have sufficient funds to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts billed and currently due from customers. We extend credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments. Management determines the allowance for uncollectible accounts by evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer's financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. Each fiscal quarter, we prepare an analysis of our ability to collect outstanding receivables that provides a basis for an allowance estimate for uncollectible accounts. In connection with this analysis, we evaluate the age of accounts receivable, past collection history, current financial conditions of key customers and economic conditions.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Commercial segment Adjusted EBITDA was $53.4 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $14.3 million, or 36.6%, from $39.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased average realized pricing and lower material costs, as well as lower selling, general and administrative expenses, which was partially offset by reduced unit volume compared to the prior year.\nFor the past several years, a significant component of our growth has been the addition of businesses or business units through acquisitions. We typically incur upfront costs as we integrate acquired businesses and implement our operating philosophy at newly acquired companies, including consolidation of supplies and materials, changes to production processes at acquired facilities to implement manufacturing improvements and other restructuring initiatives. The benefits of these integration efforts may not positively impact our financial results until subsequent periods. Operational and financial integration of our recently acquired businesses could be ongoing.\n (d) Reflects expenses associated with stock-based compensation. For fiscal year 2017, stock-based compensation expense included $13.3 million for the remeasurement of liability awards to our IPO share price, $8.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of liability awards and stock options resulting from our IPO and $3.3 million related to the redemption of performance based stock options. For the fiscal year 2016, stock-based compensation expense included $10.3 million related to the redemption of performance based stock options. For fiscal year 2016, stock-based compensation expense included $10.3 million for the accelerated vesting of stock options held by former employees, which were subsequently redeemed for cash. Approximately $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for fiscal year 2016 related to the non-cash remeasurement of outstanding liability awards to fair value. The remeasurement of the liability awards was required as a result of the Company becoming a public entity after the filing with the SEC in connection with its IPO. The remaining stock-based compensation expense of $2.9 million for fiscal year 2016 was a non-cash charge for stock options vesting on their normal vesting schedule that were not repurchased by us as described above. We do not expect that such accelerated vesting, the remeasurement of outstanding liability awards and repurchase of outstanding stock options will be an ongoing cost following our IPO. For this reason, we expect substantially all of our future stock-based compensation expense to be a non-cash expense that follows a normal vesting schedule. \n (c) In fiscal year 2017, the Company restructured some of its management functions in its Commercial segment and in its Corporate office and incurred personnel costs, including severance and other employee benefit payments of approximately $1.5 million. At October 31, 2017, a balance of $0.6 million of these restructuring costs remained unpaid.
