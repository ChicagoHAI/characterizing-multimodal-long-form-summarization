MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview: Manitowoc is a leading provider of engineered lifting solutions, including lattice-boom cranes, tower cranes, mobile telescopic cranes and boom trucks. The Company has three reportable segments, the Americas segment, EURAF segment, and MEAP segment. The segments were identified using the management approach,\u201d which designates the internal organization that is used by the CEO, who is also the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker, for making decisions about the allocation of resources and assessing performance.\nIn Management's Discussion and Analysis, unless otherwise indicated, references to Manitowoc\u201d and the Company\u201d refer to The Manitowoc Company, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAll dollar amounts are in millions throughout the tables included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations unless otherwise indicated.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of Americas, EURAF, and MEAP. Further information regarding the Company's reportable segments can be found in Note 17, Segments,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAmericas\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 969.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 882.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 693.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 764.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmericas net sales increased 9.9% in 2019 to $969.7 million from $882.7 million in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by market expansion in petrochemical and utility segments along with fleet replenishment. Share gains were also realized in several product lines, aided by positive market acceptance of new product introductions.\nAmericas operating income increased 92.9% in 2019 to $113.4 million from $58.8 million in 2018. This change was primarily due to increased revenues as discussed above, price realization, $8.3 million of lower engineering, selling and administrative costs due primarily to cost reduction actions, $3.3 million of lower restructuring expenses and better utilization of the U.S. manufacturing facilities.\nAmericas net sales increased 27.3% in 2018 to $882.7 million from $693.6 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to increased crane shipments to the commercial construction and energy end markets.\nAmericas operating income increased 764.7% in 2018 to $58.8 million from $6.8 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to $14.3 million of lower restructuring expenses, $2.0 million of lower engineering, selling and administrative costs, better utilization of the U.S. manufacturing facilities and increased revenues as discussed above. This was partially offset by increased raw material costs of $4.5 million.\nEURAF\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 644.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 680.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 628.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (68.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Measure not meaningful\nEURAF net sales decreased 5.2% in 2019 to $644.9 million from $680.6 million in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to $34.7 million of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nEURAF operating income increased in 2019 to income of $3.8 million from a loss of $68.2 million in 2018. This change was mainly due to a goodwill asset impairment charge of $82.2 million recorded in 2018. Excluding this item, operating income\ndecreased $10.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in restructuring expense and $2.3 million of incremental trade show costs in 2019. This was also impacted unfavorably by $4.3 million of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nEURAF net sales increased 8.2% in 2018 to $680.6 million from $628.9 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to higher demand for cranes in the commercial construction end market. EURAF net sales were also favorably impacted by approximately $24.0 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nEURAF operating income decreased in 2018 to a loss of $68.2 million from income of $5.1 million in 2017. This change was mainly due to a goodwill asset impairment charge of $82.2 million. Excluding this item, operating income increased $8.9 million or 174.5%. This increase was primarily due to increased revenues as discussed above, strategic pricing actions on crane sales and $5.5 million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This was partially offset by $2.0 million of increased engineering, selling and administrative costs due to trade shows in 2018 that did not occur in 2017 and increased raw material input costs of $8.0 million.\nMEAP\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 219.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 283.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 258.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMEAP net sales decreased 22.6% in 2019 to $219.5 million from $283.5 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipments of cranes for the energy end markets. MEAP net sales were also unfavorably impacted by approximately $9.2 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMEAP operating income decreased 28.3% in 2019 to $22.6 million from $31.5 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipments of cranes as discussed above and a $2.1 million increase in restructuring expenses compared to 2018. This was partially offset by $4.2 million of lower engineering, selling and administrative costs primarily due to cost reduction actions.\nMEAP net sales increased 9.5% in 2018 to $283.5 million from $258.8 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to shipments of cranes for the commercial construction and energy end markets. MEAP net sales were also favorably impacted by approximately $3.0 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMEAP operating income decreased 4.8% in 2018 to $31.5 million from $33.1 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to unfavorable geographic product mix within the MEAP segment and approximately $2.5 million of increased raw material input costs, partially offset by approximately $0.4 million of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, there was a $3.6 million loss in 2018 from a long-term note receivable resulting from the 2014 divestiture of the Company's Chinese joint venture.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 to 2018 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 to 2017 % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,834.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,846.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,581.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 344.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 328.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 281.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Engineering, selling and administrative\nexpenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 225.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 251.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 245.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense) - net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 185.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> *Measure not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nConsolidated net sales decreased 0.7% in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to $44.3 million of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower shipments of cranes for the energy end market in the MEAP segment. This was partially offset by an increase in crane shipments primarily in North America.\nConsolidated net sales increased 16.8% in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher crane shipments across all regions. Consolidated net sales were also favorably impacted by approximately $27.0 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 4.9% to $344.1 million compared to $328.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to favorable price realization and mix. This was partially offset by $10.8 million of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAs a result of favorable price realization and mix, gross profit percentage increased in 2019 to 18.8% from 17.8% in 2018.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 16.4% to $328.1 million compared to $281.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This change was due to increased net sales as discussed above.\nGross profit percentage remained flat year over year due to increased raw material input costs that were offset by strategic price increases.\nEngineering, Selling and Administrative Expenses\nEngineering, selling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $26.0 million to $225.6 million. The decrease was primarily due to the settlement of a legal matter, which included a $8.9 million recovery of legal fees expensed in previous periods, $6.8 million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and cost reduction actions.\nEngineering, selling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $6.3 million to $251.6 million. This increase was primarily due to a $3.6 million loss from a long-term note receivable resulting from the 2014 divestiture of the Company's Chinese joint venture. This was partially offset by lower trade show expenses in 2018. Further information regarding the Chinese joint venture note receivable can be found in Note 7, Notes Receivable\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAsset Impairment Expense\nAsset impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was zero compared to $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is primarily due to a $82.2 million goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the EURAF reporting unit in 2018.\nAsset impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $82.6 million compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to a $82.2 million goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the EURAF reporting unit in 2018.\nRestructuring Expense\nRestructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $9.8 million compared to $12.9 million in 2018. The costs for 2019 related primarily to severance costs for headcount reductions in Europe, North America and India.\nRestructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $12.9 million compared to $27.2 million in 2017. The costs for 2018 related primarily to severance costs for the departure of an executive officer, costs associated with training of skilled labor as a result of the transfer of crawler production to Shady Grove, PA and costs associated with headcount reductions in Europe. The costs for 2017 related primarily to the closure of manufacturing operations in Manitowoc, WI and Passo Fundo, Brazil and severance costs associated with headcount reductions in North America. See further detail at Note 20, Restructuring\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Expense & Amortization of Deferred Financing Fees\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $32.7 million versus $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction of the average effective interest rate from 11.9% in 2018 to 10.1% in 2019. The decrease in the average effective interest rate was primarily due to the refinancing of the Company's debt completed in the first quarter of 2019. Amortization expense for deferred financing fees was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.8 million in 2018. See further detail at Note 11, Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $39.1 million versus $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense was relatively flat due to a consistent average debt balance and interest rate. Amortization expense for deferred financing fees was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.9 million in 2017. See further detail at Note 11, Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $25.0 million charge associated with the refinancing of the Company's prior credit facility and notes. The charge is composed of $16.6 million of call premium on the prior notes, $5.3 million of unamortized discount on the prior notes and $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nOther income (expense) - Net\nOther income - net for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $9.8 million. Other income - net was primarily composed of a $15.5 million benefit related to a settlement of a legal matter and a $3.5 million gain on the sale of the Company's Manitowoc, Wisconsin manufacturing facility. This was partially offset by $4.4 million of pension benefit costs and $5.5 million of foreign currency transaction losses.\nOther expense - net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11.5 million. Other expense - net was primarily composed of a $4.5 million non-cash pension settlement charge, $5.0 million of pension benefit costs and $2.8 million of foreign currency transaction losses. This was partially offset by $1.2 million of gains related to the sale of property, plant and equipment.\nOther expense - net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $6.8 million. Other expense - net was primarily composed of $7.2 million of pension benefit costs. This was partially offset by $0.4 million of foreign currency transaction gains.\nIncome Taxes\nDue to the Company's historic losses, impacts from U.S. tax reform and full valuation allowances, the effective annual tax rate is not a meaningful measure of the Company's cash tax position or performance of the business.\nThe 2019 effective tax rate equaled the U.S. statutory rate of 21%. The rate was favorably impacted primarily by manufacturing and research incentives and non-U.S. income taxed at a rate other than the U.S. statutory rate. The rate was unfavorably impacted primarily by additional valuation allowances recorded during the year and U.S. tax reform.\nThe 2018 effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by the release of the unrecognized tax benefits reserve of $6.9 million and the release of the U.K valuation allowance of $12.3 million. In addition, the U.S. recognized a tax benefit of $7.8 million during the year related to deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was not recorded.\nThe 2017 effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by the release of the French valuation allowance, Internal Revenue Service audit closure, and U.S. tax reform.\nSee further detail at Note 13, Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe Company uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income, which are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), as additional metrics to evaluate the Company's performance.\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus the addback of restructuring and other charges. The Company defines adjusted operating income as adjusted EBITDA excluding the addback of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide important supplemental information to readers regarding business trends that can be used in evaluating its results of operations because these financial measures provide a consistent method of comparing financial performance and are commonly used by investors to assess performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and are not substitutes for, the GAAP financial information provided herein.\nThe reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDA, and further to adjusted EBITDA, and to adjusted operating income and operating income (loss) is as follows:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (66.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense and amortization of deferred\nfinancing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-recurring charges (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (income) expense -

This was partially offset by $116.5 million increase in net income excluding adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to operating cash flows from operating activities, a $31.5 million net reduction in working capital since December 31, 2018 and $24.4 million of net cash received from the settlement of a legal matter.\nCash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations in 2018 were $512.8 million and were primarily driven by trade receivables sold to the prior accounts receivable securitization program resulting in $553.1 million of cash flows being reported in cash provided by investing activities and a $10.8 million net increase in other working capital since December 31, 2017. This was partially offset by a $51.1 million increase in net income excluding adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to operating cash flows from operating activities.\nCash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations in 2017 were $324.3 million and were primarily driven by trade receivables sold to the prior accounts receivable securitization program resulting in $402.8 million of cash flows being reported in cash provided by investing activities. This was partially offset by a $63.1 million decrease in working capital since December 31, 2016 and a $15.4 million increase in net income excluding adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to operating cash flows from operating activities.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nCash flows provided by investing activities were $108.4 million in 2019. Cash provided by investing activities in 2019 consisted of $126.3 million of cash collections on accounts receivable sold to the Company's securitization program and $17.2 million of cash proceeds on the sale of property, plant and equipment. This was partially offset by $35.1 million of capital expenditures.\nCash flows provided by investing activities were $534.4 million in 2018. Cash provided by investing activities in 2018 primarily consisted of $553.1 million of cash collections on accounts receivable sold to the Company's securitization program and $13.0 million of cash proceeds on the sale of property, plant and equipment. This was partially offset by capital expenditures of $31.7 million.\nCash flows provided by investing activities were $381.3 million in 2017. Cash provided by investing activities in 2017 primarily consisted of $402.8 million of cash collections on accounts receivable sold to the Company's securitization program and $7.0 million of cash proceeds on the sale of property, plant and equipment. This was partially offset by capital expenditures of $28.9 million.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nCash flows provided by financing activities during 2019 totaled $3.7 million and consisted primarily of $300.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of new high-yield notes (i.e., the 2026 Notes), partially offset by payments of $276.6 million to terminate the prior high-yield notes, $8.3 million of debt issuance costs on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes, $7.4 million from the repurchase of the Company's common stock and $4.4 million of payments on other debt.\nCash flows used for financing activities during 2018 totaled $1.3 million and consisted of payments on debt of $3.8 million, partially offset by the exercise of stock options of $2.5 million.\nCash flows used for financing activities during 2017 totaled $9.7 million and consisted primarily of $15.6 million of long-term debt payments partially offset by $5.7 million of proceeds from stock option exercises.\nDebt\nOn March 25, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee and notes collateral agent, pursuant to which the Company issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured second lien notes due on April 1, 2026 with an annual coupon rate of 9.000% (the 2026 Notes\u201d). Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2026 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured second lien basis, jointly and severally, by each of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries that is either a guarantor or a borrower under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or that guarantees certain other debt of the Company or a guarantor. The 2026 Notes and the related guarantees are secured on a second-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, by pledges of capital stock and other equity interests and other security interests in substantially all of the personal property and fee-owned real property of the Company and of the guarantors that secure obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. The 2026 Notes were sold pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933.\nAdditionally, on March 25, 2019, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company (the Loan Parties\u201d) entered into a credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement\u201d) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A as administrative and collateral agent, and certain financial institutions party thereto as lenders, providing for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) of up to $275.0 million. The borrowing capacity under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is based on the value of inventory, accounts receivable and fixed assets of the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties' obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are secured on a first-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, by substantially all of the personal property and fee-owned real property of the Loan Parties. The liens securing the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are senior in priority to the second-priority liens securing the obligations under the 2026 Notes and the related guarantees. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility has a term of 5 years and includes a $75.0 million letter of credit sub-facility, $10.0 million of which is available to the Company's German subsidiary that is a borrower under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility.\nBorrowings under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate using either the Alternative Base Rate or the Eurodollar and Overnight London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). The variable interest rate is based upon the average quarterly availability as of the most recent determination date as follows:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> Average quarterly availability\n</td> <td> Alternative base rate spread\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Eurodollar and overnight LIBOR spread\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u2265 50% of Aggregate Commitment\n</td> <td> 0.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> < 50% of Aggregate Commitment\n</td> <td> 0.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company used the initial extension of credit under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, together with the net proceeds from the offering of the 2026 Notes, to (i) redeem all of the Company's $260.0 million in outstanding 12.750% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2021 (the Prior 2021 Notes\u201d); (ii) repay all obligations outstanding, and terminate all commitments, under (x) the Company's previous $225.0 million ABL Revolving Credit Facility ( Prior ABL Facility\u201d) and (y) $75.0 million AR Securitization Facility; and (iii) pay related fees and expenses, including $16.6 million of call premium on the Prior 2021 Notes, $5.0 million of closing costs and $4.6 million of accrued interest.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $25.0 million charge in the Consolidated Statement of Operations associated with the Company's refinancing of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes. The charge is composed of $16.6 million of call premium on the Prior 2021 Notes, $5.3 million of unamortized discount on the Prior 2021 Notes and $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $16.7 million outstanding of other indebtedness with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 5.1%. This debt includes balances on local credit lines and capital lease obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had no borrowings outstanding on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the highest daily borrowing was $39.7 million and the average borrowing was $8.9 million, while the average annual interest rate was 4.15%. The interest rate of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility fluctuates based on excess availability. As of December 31, 2019, the spreads for Eurodollar and Overnight LIBOR and Alternative Base Rate borrowings were 1.25% and 0.25%, respectively, with excess availability of approximately $206.4 million, which represents revolver borrowing capacity of $210.4 million less U.S. letters of credit outstanding of $4.0 million.\nBoth the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the 2026 Notes include customary covenants which include, without limitation, restrictions on the Company's ability and the ability of the Company's restricted subsidiaries to incur, assume or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred shares, pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of the Company's capital stock or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, sell or transfer certain assets, create liens on certain assets to secure debt, consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates and designate the Company's subsidiaries as unrestricted. Both the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the 2026 Notes also include customary events of default.\nAdditionally, the ABL Revolving Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio under certain circumstances set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement.\nThe aggregate scheduled maturities of outstanding debt obligations in subsequent years are as follows:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 316.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The table of scheduled maturities above does not agree to the Company's total debt as of December 31, 2019 as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Note 11, Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements due to $4.5 million of deferred financing costs related to the 2026 Notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants in its debt instruments, inclusive of the financial covenants pertaining to the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes. Based upon\nmanagement's current plans and outlook, the Company believes it will be able to comply with these covenants during the subsequent twelve months.\nAccounts Receivable Securitization and Other Financing Arrangements\nThe Company had maintained a Receivables Purchase Agreement among Manitowoc Funding, LLC ( MTW Funding\u201d), as Seller, The Manitowoc Company, Inc., as Servicer, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Purchaser and as Agent, with a commitment size of $75.0 million (the RPA\u201d). Under the RPA (and the related Purchase and Sale Agreements referenced in the RPA), the Company's domestic trade accounts receivable were sold to MTW Funding which, in turn, sold, conveyed, transferred and assigned to a third-party financial institution, all of MTW Funding's rights, title and interest in a pool of receivables to the Purchaser. Transactions under the program were accounted for as sales in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing\u201d ( Topic 860\u201d). This program was terminated on March 25, 2019.\nThe Company has two non-U.S. accounts receivable financing programs. During 2019, the Company increased the maximum limit that can be sold and outstanding under these programs from \u20ac45 million to \u20ac55 million. Under these financing programs, the Company has the ability to sell eligible receivables up to the maximum limit and can sell additional receivables as previously sold receivables are collected. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold \u20ac193.6 million of receivables and received cash of \u20ac193.6 million. Transactions under the program were accounted for as sales in accordance with Topic 860.\nSee further details at Note 12, Accounts Receivable Securitization and Other Financing Arrangements\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company funds capital expenditures that are intended to:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> improve the cost structure of the Company's business,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> invest in new processes, products and technology and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintain high-quality production standards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company spent a total of $35.1 million during 2019 for capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2019, depreciation was $35.0 million.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's debt position at various times increases our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, and results in a meaningful portion of our cash flows from operations being used for payment of interest on our debt. This could potentially limit the Company's ability to respond to market conditions or take advantage of future business opportunities. The Company's ability to service its debt is dependent upon many factors, some of which are not subject to its control, such as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors. In addition, the Company's ability to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility in the future will depend on the Company meeting the financial covenants contained in the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, even after taking into account such new borrowings.\nThe Company's revolving credit facility, or other future facilities, may be used for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, funding future acquisitions (within the Company's debt limitations), and other operating, investing and financing needs. The Company believes that its available cash, ABL Revolving Credit Facility, cash generated from future operations, and access to public debt and equity markets will be adequate to fund its capital and debt financing requirements for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company's liquidity positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 199.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolver borrowing capacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 210.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other debt availability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Borrowings on revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Borrowings on other debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Outstanding letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 444.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 276.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company believes its liquidity and expected cash flows from operations should be sufficient to meet expected working capital, capital expenditure and other general ongoing operational needs in the foreseeable future.\nWith the enactment of U.S. tax reform, the Company believes that its offshore cash can be accessed in a more tax efficient manner. During 2018, the Company updated its assertion that foreign earnings are permanently reinvested such that jurisdictions where cash can be tax efficiently repatriated are no longer permanently reinvested. These earnings, if repatriated to the U.S., would not result in material tax expense. However, the Company does record deferred tax liabilities related to non-U.S. withholding taxes on these unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested.\nBoth the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes include customary covenants and events of default. Refer to Note 11, Debt,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussions of covenants for the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes. Based upon management's current plans and outlook, the Company believes it will be able to comply with these covenants during the subsequent twelve months.\nManagement also considers the following regarding liquidity and capital resources to identify trends, demands, commitments, events and uncertainties that require disclosure:\nA. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and indenture governing the 2026 Notes require us to comply with certain financial ratios and tests. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2019, the latest measurement date. The occurrence of any default of these covenants could result in acceleration of any outstanding balances under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. Further, such acceleration would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing our 2026 Notes and other debt and could trigger cross default provisions in other agreements.\nB. Circumstances that could impair our ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential, or that could render that activity commercially impracticable, such as the inability to maintain a specified credit rating, level of earnings, earnings per share, financial ratios, or collateral. We do not believe that these risk factors are reasonably likely to impair our ability to continue to engage in our planned activities at this time.\nC. Factors specific to us and our markets that we expect to be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect our ability to raise short-term and long-term financing. We do not presently believe that events covered by these risk factors applicable to our business could materially affect our credit ratings or could adversely affect our ability to raise short-term or long-term financing.\nD. We have disclosed information related to certain guarantees in Note 19, Guarantees,\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nE. Written options on non-financial assets (for example, real estate puts). We do not have any written options on non-financial assets.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nOur disclosures concerning transactions, arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources are as follows:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We have disclosed in Note 19, Guarantees,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements our buyback commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We have disclosed our accounts receivable securitization arrangement in Note 12, Accounts Receivable Securitization and Other Factoring Arrangements\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nA summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 is as follows:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\nCommitted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt (including capital lease\nobligations)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 316.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on long-term debt (including\ncapital lease obligations)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 168.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 469.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 445.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,012.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 488.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 350.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Unrecognized tax benefits totaling $11.5 million as of December 31, 2019, excluding related interest and penalties, are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated.

We also had buyback commitments with a balance outstanding of $28.5 million as of December 31, 2019. This amount is not reduced for amounts the Company would recover from the repossession and subsequent resale of collateral.\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of the Company's employees and retirees. The Board of Directors has established the Retirement Plan Committee to manage the operations and administration of all benefit plans and related trusts. For further information see Note 21, Employee Benefit Plans\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn 2019, cash contributions by the Company to defined benefit pension plans were $9.0 million, and the Company estimates that its contributions will be approximately $11.1 million in 2020. Cash contributions to the Company's 401(k) plan was $6.1 million in 2019.\nFinancial Risk Management\nWe are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates, commodities and foreign currency exchange rates. To reduce these risks, we selectively use derivative financial instruments and other proactive management techniques. We have written policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of corporate finance and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes. The use of financial instruments for trading purposes or speculation is strictly prohibited.\nFor a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies and the financial instruments that we use, please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\u201d and Note 11, Debt,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuating interest rates for our debt. At any time, the Company could be party to various interest rate swaps in connection with its fixed or floating rate debt. No interest rate swaps were entered into or outstanding during 2019 and 2018.\nCommodity Prices\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities, including steel, copper, aluminum, and petroleum-based products. The Company's business is subject to the effect of changing raw material costs caused by movements in underlying commodity prices. The Company has established programs to manage the negotiations of commodity prices. From time to time the Company may use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. No commodity financial instruments were entered into or outstanding during 2019 and 2018.\nCurrency Risk\nThe Company has manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world and therefore makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various currencies, which introduces transactional currency exchange risk.\nTo mitigate transactional currency exchange risk, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into foreign exchange contracts to 1) reduce the earnings and cash flows impact on non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables and 2) reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates between a budgeted rate and the rate realized at the time we recognize a particular purchase or sale transaction. Gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments either impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of the underlying purchase or sale transaction, or offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying receivables and payables being hedged. The maturities of these foreign exchange contracts coincide with the expected underlying settlement date of the related cash inflow or outflow. The hedges of anticipated transactions are designated as cash flow hedges under the guidance of ASC No. 815 Derivatives and Hedging.\u201d At December 31, 2019, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of $32.6 million, all of which are carried on the Company's balance sheet at fair value. As of December 31, 2019, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in the Company's portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased the Company's unrealized losses by $3.3 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged.\nAmounts invested in non-U.S. based subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at year-end. Results of operations are translated into U.S. dollars at an average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders' equity as other comprehensive income (loss). The cumulative translation adjustment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2019 was a loss of $81.1 million.\nEnvironmental, Health, Safety, Contingencies and Other Matters\nPlease refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d where the Company has disclosed environmental, health, safety, contingencies and other matters.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes. In preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements giving due consideration to materiality. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Although the Company has listed a number of accounting policies below which the Company believes to be most critical, the Company also believes that all of the Company's accounting policies are important to the reader. Therefore, please refer also to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed description of these and other accounting policies of the Company.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company records revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d Below are our revenue recognition policies by performance obligation.\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Crane Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCrane revenue is primarily generated through the sale of new and used cranes. Contracts with customers are generally in the form of a purchase order. Based on the nature of the Company's contracts, the Company does not have any significant financing terms. Contracts may have variable consideration in the form of early pay discounts or rebates.\nRevenue is earned under these contracts when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Control transfers to the customer generally upon delivery to the carrier or acceptance through an independent inspection company that acts as an agent of the customer.\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into agreements where the customer has the right to exercise a buyback option for the repurchase of a crane by the Company at an agreed upon price. The Company evaluates each agreement at the inception of the order to determine if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right. If it is determined that the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right, the agreement is accounted for as a lease in accordance with ASC Topic 842 - Leases.\u201d If it is determined that the customer does not have a significant economic incentive to exercise that right, then revenue is recognized when control of the asset is transferred to the customer.\nGiven the nature of the Company's products, from time to time, the customer may request that the product be held until a delivery location is identified. Under these bill and hold\u201d arrangements, revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: 1) the reason for the bill-and-hold arrangement is substantive, 2) the product is separately identified as belonging to the customer, 3) the product is ready for transfer to the customer, and 4) the Company does not have the ability to use the product or direct it to another customer.\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Aftermarket Part Sales\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAftermarket part sales are generated through the sale of new and used parts to end customers and distributors. Aftermarket parts revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Control transfers to the customer generally upon delivery to the carrier. Customers generally have a right of return which the Company estimates using historical information. The amount of estimated returns is deducted from revenue.\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other Revenues\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's other revenues consist primarily of revenues from:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> o\n</td> <td> Repair and field service work; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> o\n</td> <td> Training and technical publications.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs it relates to the Company's other revenues, the Company's performance obligations generally relate to performing specific agreed upon services. Revenue is earned upon the completion of those services.\nInventories and Related Reserve for Obsolete and Excess Inventory - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. Inventories are reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimated reserve is based upon specific identification of excess or obsolete inventories based on historical usage, estimated future usage, sales requiring the inventory and historical write-off experience and are subject to change if experience improves or deteriorates.\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets - The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under the guidance of ASC Topic 350-10, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d Under ASC Topic 350-10, goodwill is not amortized; instead, the Company performs an annual impairment review. The date for the annual impairment review is October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. To perform its goodwill impairment review, the Company uses a fair-value method, primarily the income approach, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Goodwill impairment is determined by the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. To perform its indefinite lived intangible assets impairment test, the Company uses a fair-value method, based on a relief of royalty valuation approach. Management's judgments and assumptions about the amounts of those cash flows and the discount rates are inputs to these analyses. The estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset. Goodwill and other intangible assets are then subject to risk of write-down to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.\nThe Company has three reporting units: Americas, EURAF and MEAP.\nAs of October 31, 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived assets impairment tests, and based on those results, no impairment was indicated. The valuation of the goodwill is particularly sensitive to management's assumptions\nof revenue growth rates and projected operating income, and an unfavorable change in those assumptions could put goodwill at risk for impairment in future periods.\nOther intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Definite lived intangible assets are also subject to impairment testing whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If an indicator of impairment were identified, the Company would use the income approach, which is based on the present value of expected future cash flows.\nThe Company also reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-5, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d ASC Topic 360-10-5 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and to evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line depreciation method for financial reporting and on accelerated methods for income tax purposes.\nThe Company monitors market conditions to determine if any additional interim reviews of goodwill, other intangibles or long-lived assets are warranted. Deterioration in the market or actual results as compared with the Company's projections may ultimately result in a future impairment. In the event the Company determines that assets are impaired in the future, the Company would recognize a non-cash impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Results of Operations.\nEmployee Benefit Plans - The Company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement health care coverage. Plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the Company's measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement and mortality rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date. The approach the Company used to determine the annual assumptions are as follows:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Discount Rate - The Company's discount rate assumptions are based on the interest rate of noncallable high-quality corporate bonds, with appropriate consideration of our pension plans' participants' demographics and benefit payment terms. The Company's discount rate is provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high-quality bonds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Return on Plan Assets - The Company's expected return on plan assets assumptions are based on the Company's expectation of the long-term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds, which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Compensation increase - The Company's compensation increase assumptions reflect its long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Retirement and Mortality Rates - The Company's retirement and mortality rate assumptions are based primarily on actual plan experience and mortality tables.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Health Care Cost Trend Rates - The Company's health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMeasurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year-end measurements of assets and obligations. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions when appropriate. As required by GAAP, the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods. The Company has developed the assumptions with the assistance of its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, and believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 21, Employee Benefit Plans\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a summary of the impact of a 0.50% change in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets would have on the Company's financial statements.\nProduct Liability - The Company is subject, in the normal course of business, to product liability lawsuits. To the extent permitted under applicable laws, the Company's exposure to losses from these lawsuits is mitigated by insurance with self-insurance retention limits. The Company records product liability reserves for its self-insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability actions. The Company's reserve is based upon two estimates. First, the Company has tracked the population of all outstanding pending and threatened product liability cases to determine an appropriate case reserve for each\nbased upon its best judgment and the advice of legal counsel. These estimates are continually evaluated and adjusted based upon changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding the case. Second, the Company determined the amount of additional reserve required to cover incurred, but not reported, product liability issues and to account for possible adverse development of the established case reserves (collectively referred to as IBNR\u201d). The Company has established a position within the actuarially determined range, which it believes is the best estimate of the IBNR liability.\nIncome Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes under the guidance of ASC Topic 740-10, Income Taxes.\u201d Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance that represents a reserve on deferred tax assets for which utilization is not more likely than not. Management judgment is required in determining its provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets. The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and non-U.S. income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nThe Company measures and records income tax contingency accruals under the guidance of ASC Topic 740-10. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as the Company must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, expirations due to statutes, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual.\nWarranties - In the normal course of business, the Company provides its customers warranties covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products manufactured. Such warranties generally provide that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from 12 months to 60 months with certain equipment having longer-term warranties. If a product fails to comply with the Company's warranties, it may be obligated, at its expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product. The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its warranties at the time product revenue is recognized based on historical warranty experience for the related product or estimates of projected losses due to specific warranty issues on new products. These costs primarily include labor and materials, as necessary, associated with repair or replacement. The primary factors that affect the Company's warranty liabilities include the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates or warranty claims. As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amounts as necessary.\nRecent Accounting Changes and Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under the caption Recent Accounting Changes and Pronouncements,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes under the guidance of ASC Topic 740-10, Income Taxes.\u201d Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance that represents a reserve on deferred tax assets for which utilization is not more likely than not. Management judgment is required in determining its provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets. The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and non-U.S. income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities, including steel, copper, aluminum, and petroleum-based products. The Company's business is subject to the effect of changing raw material costs caused by movements in underlying commodity prices. The Company has established programs to manage the negotiations of commodity prices. From time to time the Company may use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices.

This could potentially limit the Company's ability to respond to market conditions or take advantage of future business opportunities. The Company's ability to service its debt is dependent upon many factors, some of which are not subject to its control, such as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors. In addition, the Company's ability to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility in the future will depend on the Company meeting the financial covenants contained in the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, even after taking into account such new borrowings.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 4.9% to $344.1 million compared to $328.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

At any time, the Company could be party to various interest rate swaps in connection with its fixed or floating rate debt. No interest rate swaps were entered into or outstanding during 2019 and 2018.\nThe Company used the initial extension of credit under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, together with the net proceeds from the offering of the 2026 Notes, to (i) redeem all of the Company's $260.0 million in outstanding 12.750% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2021 (the Prior 2021 Notes\u201d); (ii) repay all obligations outstanding, and terminate all commitments, under (x) the Company's previous $225.0 million ABL Revolving Credit Facility ( Prior ABL Facility\u201d) and (y) $75.0 million AR Securitization Facility; and (iii) pay related fees and expenses, including $16.6 million of call premium on the Prior 2021 Notes, $5.0 million of closing costs and $4.6 million of accrued interest.\nProduct Liability - The Company is subject, in the normal course of business, to product liability lawsuits. To the extent permitted under applicable laws, the Company's exposure to losses from these lawsuits is mitigated by insurance with self-insurance retention limits. The Company records product liability reserves for its self-insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability actions. The Company's reserve is based upon two estimates. First, the Company has tracked the population of all outstanding pending and threatened product liability cases to determine an appropriate case reserve for each\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nA. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and indenture governing the 2026 Notes require us to comply with certain financial ratios and tests. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2019, the latest measurement date. The occurrence of any default of these covenants could result in acceleration of any outstanding balances under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. Further, such acceleration would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing our 2026 Notes and other debt and could trigger cross default provisions in other agreements.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies and the financial instruments that we use, please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\u201d and Note 11, Debt,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRestructuring Expense\n \u2022 Discount Rate - The Company's discount rate assumptions are based on the interest rate of noncallable high-quality corporate bonds, with appropriate consideration of our pension plans' participants' demographics and benefit payment terms. The Company's discount rate is provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high-quality bonds. \nAsset Impairment Expense\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRevenue is earned under these contracts when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Control transfers to the customer generally upon delivery to the carrier or acceptance through an independent inspection company that acts as an agent of the customer.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $16.7 million outstanding of other indebtedness with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 5.1%. This debt includes balances on local credit lines and capital lease obligations.\nOur disclosures concerning transactions, arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources are as follows:\nOn March 25, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee and notes collateral agent, pursuant to which the Company issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured second lien notes due on April 1, 2026 with an annual coupon rate of 9.000% (the 2026 Notes\u201d). Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2026 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured second lien basis, jointly and severally, by each of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries that is either a guarantor or a borrower under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or that guarantees certain other debt of the Company or a guarantor. The 2026 Notes and the related guarantees are secured on a second-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, by pledges of capital stock and other equity interests and other security interests in substantially all of the personal property and fee-owned real property of the Company and of the guarantors that secure obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. The 2026 Notes were sold pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933.\n \u2022 maintain high-quality production standards. \n \u2022 Expected Return on Plan Assets - The Company's expected return on plan assets assumptions are based on the Company's expectation of the long-term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds, which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds. \nRecent Accounting Changes and Pronouncements\nMEAP operating income decreased 4.8% in 2018 to $31.5 million from $33.1 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to unfavorable geographic product mix within the MEAP segment and approximately $2.5 million of increased raw material input costs, partially offset by approximately $0.4 million of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, there was a $3.6 million loss in 2018 from a long-term note receivable resulting from the 2014 divestiture of the Company's Chinese joint venture.\nEmployee Benefit Plans - The Company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement health care coverage. Plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the Company's measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement and mortality rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date. The approach the Company used to determine the annual assumptions are as follows:\nThe Company uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income, which are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), as additional metrics to evaluate the Company's performance.\nOther expense - net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $6.8 million. Other expense - net was primarily composed of $7.2 million of pension benefit costs. This was partially offset by $0.4 million of foreign currency transaction gains.\nThe Company uses adjusted operating cash flows and free cash flows of continuing operations, which are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as additional metrics to evaluate the Company's performance. Adjusted operating cash flows is defined as cash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations plus cash receipts on sold accounts receivable and other one-time items. Free cash flows are defined as adjusted operating cash flows less capital expenditures. The reconciliation of cash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations to adjusted operating cash flows and further to free cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are summarized as follows:\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has two non-U.S. accounts receivable financing programs. During 2019, the Company increased the maximum limit that can be sold and outstanding under these programs from \u20ac45 million to \u20ac55 million. Under these financing programs, the Company has the ability to sell eligible receivables up to the maximum limit and can sell additional receivables as previously sold receivables are collected. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold \u20ac193.6 million of receivables and received cash of \u20ac193.6 million. Transactions under the program were accounted for as sales in accordance with Topic 860.\nof revenue growth rates and projected operating income, and an unfavorable change in those assumptions could put goodwill at risk for impairment in future periods.\nCash Flows\nThe 2018 effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by the release of the unrecognized tax benefits reserve of $6.9 million and the release of the U.K valuation allowance of $12.3 million. In addition, the U.S. recognized a tax benefit of $7.8 million during the year related to deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was not recorded.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nGross profit percentage remained flat year over year due to increased raw material input costs that were offset by strategic price increases.\nSee further detail at Note 13, Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash flows provided by investing activities were $381.3 million in 2017. Cash provided by investing activities in 2017 primarily consisted of $402.8 million of cash collections on accounts receivable sold to the Company's securitization program and $7.0 million of cash proceeds on the sale of property, plant and equipment. This was partially offset by capital expenditures of $28.9 million.\n \u2022 Other Revenues \n\nCommodity Prices\n o Training and technical publications. \nLiquidity\nThe Company's revolving credit facility, or other future facilities, may be used for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, funding future acquisitions (within the Company's debt limitations), and other operating, investing and financing needs. The Company believes that its available cash, ABL Revolving Credit Facility, cash generated from future operations, and access to public debt and equity markets will be adequate to fund its capital and debt financing requirements for the foreseeable future.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $39.1 million versus $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense was relatively flat due to a consistent average debt balance and interest rate. Amortization expense for deferred financing fees was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.9 million in 2017. See further detail at Note 11, Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations in 2018 were $512.8 million and were primarily driven by trade receivables sold to the prior accounts receivable securitization program resulting in $553.1 million of cash flows being reported in cash provided by investing activities and a $10.8 million net increase in other working capital since December 31, 2017. This was partially offset by a $51.1 million increase in net income excluding adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to operating cash flows from operating activities.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAll dollar amounts are in millions throughout the tables included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations unless otherwise indicated.\nConsolidated net sales decreased 0.7% in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to $44.3 million of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower shipments of cranes for the energy end market in the MEAP segment. This was partially offset by an increase in crane shipments primarily in North America.\nSegment Operating Performance\nBoth the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the 2026 Notes include customary covenants which include, without limitation, restrictions on the Company's ability and the ability of the Company's restricted subsidiaries to incur, assume or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred shares, pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of the Company's capital stock or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, sell or transfer certain assets, create liens on certain assets to secure debt, consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates and designate the Company's subsidiaries as unrestricted. Both the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the 2026 Notes also include customary events of default.\nbased upon its best judgment and the advice of legal counsel. These estimates are continually evaluated and adjusted based upon changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding the case. Second, the Company determined the amount of additional reserve required to cover incurred, but not reported, product liability issues and to account for possible adverse development of the established case reserves (collectively referred to as IBNR\u201d). The Company has established a position within the actuarially determined range, which it believes is the best estimate of the IBNR liability.\nNet Sales\nEURAF operating income decreased in 2018 to a loss of $68.2 million from income of $5.1 million in 2017. This change was mainly due to a goodwill asset impairment charge of $82.2 million. Excluding this item, operating income increased $8.9 million or 174.5%. This increase was primarily due to increased revenues as discussed above, strategic pricing actions on crane sales and $5.5 million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This was partially offset by $2.0 million of increased engineering, selling and administrative costs due to trade shows in 2018 that did not occur in 2017 and increased raw material input costs of $8.0 million.\nThe Company has manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world and therefore makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various currencies, which introduces transactional currency exchange risk.\nCash flows provided by investing activities were $108.4 million in 2019. Cash provided by investing activities in 2019 consisted of $126.3 million of cash collections on accounts receivable sold to the Company's securitization program and $17.2 million of cash proceeds on the sale of property, plant and equipment. This was partially offset by $35.1 million of capital expenditures.\nAs a result of favorable price realization and mix, gross profit percentage increased in 2019 to 18.8% from 17.8% in 2018.\nAs of October 31, 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived assets impairment tests, and based on those results, no impairment was indicated. The valuation of the goodwill is particularly sensitive to management's assumptions\nSee further details at Note 12, Accounts Receivable Securitization and Other Financing Arrangements\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n o Repair and field service work; and \nAt December 31, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled $4.0 million. We also had buyback commitments with a balance outstanding of $28.5 million as of December 31, 2019. This amount is not reduced for amounts the Company would recover from the repossession and subsequent resale of collateral.\nMEAP net sales decreased 22.6% in 2019 to $219.5 million from $283.5 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipments of cranes for the energy end markets. MEAP net sales were also unfavorably impacted by approximately $9.2 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company measures and records income tax contingency accruals under the guidance of ASC Topic 740-10. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as the Company must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, expirations due to statutes, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual.\n\nThe Company also reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-5, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d ASC Topic 360-10-5 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and to evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line depreciation method for financial reporting and on accelerated methods for income tax purposes.\n* Measure not meaningful\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under the caption Recent Accounting Changes and Pronouncements,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAmericas\nWith the enactment of U.S. tax reform, the Company believes that its offshore cash can be accessed in a more tax efficient manner. During 2018, the Company updated its assertion that foreign earnings are permanently reinvested such that jurisdictions where cash can be tax efficiently repatriated are no longer permanently reinvested. These earnings, if repatriated to the U.S., would not result in material tax expense. However, the Company does record deferred tax liabilities related to non-U.S. withholding taxes on these unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\n \u2022 Health Care Cost Trend Rates - The Company's health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. \nRestructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $12.9 million compared to $27.2 million in 2017. The costs for 2018 related primarily to severance costs for the departure of an executive officer, costs associated with training of skilled labor as a result of the transfer of crawler production to Shady Grove, PA and costs associated with headcount reductions in Europe. The costs for 2017 related primarily to the closure of manufacturing operations in Manitowoc, WI and Passo Fundo, Brazil and severance costs associated with headcount reductions in North America. See further detail at Note 20, Restructuring\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets - The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under the guidance of ASC Topic 350-10, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d Under ASC Topic 350-10, goodwill is not amortized; instead, the Company performs an annual impairment review. The date for the annual impairment review is October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. To perform its goodwill impairment review, the Company uses a fair-value method, primarily the income approach, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Goodwill impairment is determined by the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. To perform its indefinite lived intangible assets impairment test, the Company uses a fair-value method, based on a relief of royalty valuation approach. Management's judgments and assumptions about the amounts of those cash flows and the discount rates are inputs to these analyses. The estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset. Goodwill and other intangible assets are then subject to risk of write-down to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.\nOther intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Definite lived intangible assets are also subject to impairment testing whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If an indicator of impairment were identified, the Company would use the income approach, which is based on the present value of expected future cash flows.\nAdditionally, on March 25, 2019, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company (the Loan Parties\u201d) entered into a credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement\u201d) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A as administrative and collateral agent, and certain financial institutions party thereto as lenders, providing for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) of up to $275.0 million. The borrowing capacity under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is based on the value of inventory, accounts receivable and fixed assets of the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties' obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are secured on a first-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, by substantially all of the personal property and fee-owned real property of the Loan Parties. The liens securing the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are senior in priority to the second-priority liens securing the obligations under the 2026 Notes and the related guarantees. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility has a term of 5 years and includes a $75.0 million letter of credit sub-facility, $10.0 million of which is available to the Company's German subsidiary that is a borrower under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company records revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d Below are our revenue recognition policies by performance obligation.\nInterest Expense & Amortization of Deferred Financing Fees\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes. In preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements giving due consideration to materiality. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Although the Company has listed a number of accounting policies below which the Company believes to be most critical, the Company also believes that all of the Company's accounting policies are important to the reader. Therefore, please refer also to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed description of these and other accounting policies of the Company.\nC. Factors specific to us and our markets that we expect to be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect our ability to raise short-term and long-term financing. We do not presently believe that events covered by these risk factors applicable to our business could materially affect our credit ratings or could adversely affect our ability to raise short-term or long-term financing.\nEURAF\n \u2022 The table of scheduled maturities above does not agree to the Company's total debt as of December 31, 2019 as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Note 11, Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements due to $4.5 million of deferred financing costs related to the 2026 Notes. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $25.0 million charge associated with the refinancing of the Company's prior credit facility and notes. The charge is composed of $16.6 million of call premium on the prior notes, $5.3 million of unamortized discount on the prior notes and $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nMeasurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year-end measurements of assets and obligations. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions when appropriate. As required by GAAP, the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods. The Company has developed the assumptions with the assistance of its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, and believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 21, Employee Benefit Plans\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a summary of the impact of a 0.50% change in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets would have on the Company's financial statements.\nBorrowings under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate using either the Alternative Base Rate or the Eurodollar and Overnight London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). The variable interest rate is based upon the average quarterly availability as of the most recent determination date as follows:\nGross Profit\ndecreased $10.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in restructuring expense and $2.3 million of incremental trade show costs in 2019. This was also impacted unfavorably by $4.3 million of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nTo mitigate transactional currency exchange risk, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into foreign exchange contracts to 1) reduce the earnings and cash flows impact on non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables and 2) reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates between a budgeted rate and the rate realized at the time we recognize a particular purchase or sale transaction. Gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments either impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of the underlying purchase or sale transaction, or offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying receivables and payables being hedged. The maturities of these foreign exchange contracts coincide with the expected underlying settlement date of the related cash inflow or outflow. The hedges of anticipated transactions are designated as cash flow hedges under the guidance of ASC No. 815 Derivatives and Hedging.\u201d At December 31, 2019, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of $32.6 million, all of which are carried on the Company's balance sheet at fair value. As of December 31, 2019, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in the Company's portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased the Company's unrealized losses by $3.3 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company had maintained a Receivables Purchase Agreement among Manitowoc Funding, LLC ( MTW Funding\u201d), as Seller, The Manitowoc Company, Inc., as Servicer, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Purchaser and as Agent, with a commitment size of $75.0 million (the RPA\u201d). Under the RPA (and the related Purchase and Sale Agreements referenced in the RPA), the Company's domestic trade accounts receivable were sold to MTW Funding which, in turn, sold, conveyed, transferred and assigned to a third-party financial institution, all of MTW Funding's rights, title and interest in a pool of receivables to the Purchaser. Transactions under the program were accounted for as sales in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing\u201d ( Topic 860\u201d).

Based upon\nCapital Expenditures\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $32.7 million versus $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction of the average effective interest rate from 11.9% in 2018 to 10.1% in 2019. The decrease in the average effective interest rate was primarily due to the refinancing of the Company's debt completed in the first quarter of 2019. Amortization expense for deferred financing fees was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.8 million in 2018. See further detail at Note 11, Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther income - net for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $9.8 million. Other income - net was primarily composed of a $15.5 million benefit related to a settlement of a legal matter and a $3.5 million gain on the sale of the Company's Manitowoc, Wisconsin manufacturing facility. This was partially offset by $4.4 million of pension benefit costs and $5.5 million of foreign currency transaction losses.\nA summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 is as follows:\nAmericas operating income increased 92.9% in 2019 to $113.4 million from $58.8 million in 2018. This change was primarily due to increased revenues as discussed above, price realization, $8.3 million of lower engineering, selling and administrative costs due primarily to cost reduction actions, $3.3 million of lower restructuring expenses and better utilization of the U.S. manufacturing facilities.\nWe are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates, commodities and foreign currency exchange rates. To reduce these risks, we selectively use derivative financial instruments and other proactive management techniques. We have written policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of corporate finance and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes. The use of financial instruments for trading purposes or speculation is strictly prohibited.\nFinancial Risk Management\nEngineering, selling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $26.0 million to $225.6 million. The decrease was primarily due to the settlement of a legal matter, which included a $8.9 million recovery of legal fees expensed in previous periods, $6.8 million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and cost reduction actions.\n \u2022 improve the cost structure of the Company's business, \n \u2022 Retirement and Mortality Rates - The Company's retirement and mortality rate assumptions are based primarily on actual plan experience and mortality tables. \n \u2022 Aftermarket Part Sales \n\nD.

Results of operations are translated into U.S. dollars at an average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders' equity as other comprehensive income (loss). The cumulative translation adjustment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2019 was a loss of $81.1 million.\nThe Company believes its liquidity and expected cash flows from operations should be sufficient to meet expected working capital, capital expenditure and other general ongoing operational needs in the foreseeable future.\nCash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations in 2017 were $324.3 million and were primarily driven by trade receivables sold to the prior accounts receivable securitization program resulting in $402.8 million of cash flows being reported in cash provided by investing activities. This was partially offset by a $63.1 million decrease in working capital since December 31, 2016 and a $15.4 million increase in net income excluding adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to operating cash flows from operating activities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $25.0 million charge in the Consolidated Statement of Operations associated with the Company's refinancing of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes. The charge is composed of $16.6 million of call premium on the Prior 2021 Notes, $5.3 million of unamortized discount on the Prior 2021 Notes and $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nAsset impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $82.6 million compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to a $82.2 million goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the EURAF reporting unit in 2018.\nThe Company's other revenues consist primarily of revenues from:\nEnvironmental, Health, Safety, Contingencies and Other Matters\nDebt\nInventories and Related Reserve for Obsolete and Excess Inventory - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. Inventories are reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimated reserve is based upon specific identification of excess or obsolete inventories based on historical usage, estimated future usage, sales requiring the inventory and historical write-off experience and are subject to change if experience improves or deteriorates.\nThe Company funds capital expenditures that are intended to:\n\n \u2022 We have disclosed in Note 19, Guarantees,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements our buyback commitments. \nEURAF operating income increased in 2019 to income of $3.8 million from a loss of $68.2 million in 2018. This change was mainly due to a goodwill asset impairment charge of $82.2 million recorded in 2018. Excluding this item, operating income\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus the addback of restructuring and other charges. The Company defines adjusted operating income as adjusted EBITDA excluding the addback of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide important supplemental information to readers regarding business trends that can be used in evaluating its results of operations because these financial measures provide a consistent method of comparing financial performance and are commonly used by investors to assess performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and are not substitutes for, the GAAP financial information provided herein.\nCurrency Risk\nMEAP net sales increased 9.5% in 2018 to $283.5 million from $258.8 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to shipments of cranes for the commercial construction and energy end markets. MEAP net sales were also favorably impacted by approximately $3.0 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 16.4% to $328.1 million compared to $281.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This change was due to increased net sales as discussed above.\nThe reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDA, and further to adjusted EBITDA, and to adjusted operating income and operating income (loss) is as follows:\nAmericas net sales increased 27.3% in 2018 to $882.7 million from $693.6 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to increased crane shipments to the commercial construction and energy end markets.\nAs it relates to the Company's other revenues, the Company's performance obligations generally relate to performing specific agreed upon services. Revenue is earned upon the completion of those services.\nMEAP operating income decreased 28.3% in 2019 to $22.6 million from $31.5 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipments of cranes as discussed above and a $2.1 million increase in restructuring expenses compared to 2018. This was partially offset by $4.2 million of lower engineering, selling and administrative costs primarily due to cost reduction actions.\nB. Circumstances that could impair our ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential, or that could render that activity commercially impracticable, such as the inability to maintain a specified credit rating, level of earnings, earnings per share, financial ratios, or collateral. We do not believe that these risk factors are reasonably likely to impair our ability to continue to engage in our planned activities at this time.\nCash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations in 2019 were $53.3 million and were primarily driven by trade receivables sold to the prior accounts receivable securitization program resulting in $126.3 million of cash flows being reported in cash provided by investing activities and $75.0 million of purchases of accounts receivable previously sold to the prior accounts receivable securitization program. This was partially offset by $116.5 million increase in net income excluding adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to operating cash flows from operating activities, a $31.5 million net reduction in working capital since December 31, 2018 and $24.4 million of net cash received from the settlement of a legal matter.\nAmericas net sales increased 9.9% in 2019 to $969.7 million from $882.7 million in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by market expansion in petrochemical and utility segments along with fleet replenishment. Share gains were also realized in several product lines, aided by positive market acceptance of new product introductions.\n\nCash flows used for financing activities during 2017 totaled $9.7 million and consisted primarily of $15.6 million of long-term debt payments partially offset by $5.7 million of proceeds from stock option exercises.\nAmericas operating income increased 764.7% in 2018 to $58.8 million from $6.8 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to $14.3 million of lower restructuring expenses, $2.0 million of lower engineering, selling and administrative costs, better utilization of the U.S. manufacturing facilities and increased revenues as discussed above. This was partially offset by increased raw material costs of $4.5 million.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\n \u2022 Crane Revenue \nRestructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $9.8 million compared to $12.9 million in 2018. The costs for 2019 related primarily to severance costs for headcount reductions in Europe, North America and India.\nOther expense - net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11.5 million. Other expense - net was primarily composed of a $4.5 million non-cash pension settlement charge, $5.0 million of pension benefit costs and $2.8 million of foreign currency transaction losses. This was partially offset by $1.2 million of gains related to the sale of property, plant and equipment.\nThe Company spent a total of $35.1 million during 2019 for capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2019, depreciation was $35.0 million.\nEURAF net sales decreased 5.2% in 2019 to $644.9 million from $680.6 million in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to $34.7 million of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOther income (expense) - Net\nThe Company's liquidity positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows:\nEngineering, selling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $6.3 million to $251.6 million. This increase was primarily due to a $3.6 million loss from a long-term note receivable resulting from the 2014 divestiture of the Company's Chinese joint venture. This was partially offset by lower trade show expenses in 2018. Further information regarding the Chinese joint venture note receivable can be found in Note 7, Notes Receivable\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of the Company's employees and retirees. The Board of Directors has established the Retirement Plan Committee to manage the operations and administration of all benefit plans and related trusts. For further information see Note 21, Employee Benefit Plans\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had no borrowings outstanding on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the highest daily borrowing was $39.7 million and the average borrowing was $8.9 million, while the average annual interest rate was 4.15%. The interest rate of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility fluctuates based on excess availability. As of December 31, 2019, the spreads for Eurodollar and Overnight LIBOR and Alternative Base Rate borrowings were 1.25% and 0.25%, respectively, with excess availability of approximately $206.4 million, which represents revolver borrowing capacity of $210.4 million less U.S. letters of credit outstanding of $4.0 million.\n\nConsolidated net sales increased 16.8% in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher crane shipments across all regions. Consolidated net sales were also favorably impacted by approximately $27.0 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAsset impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was zero compared to $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is primarily due to a $82.2 million goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the EURAF reporting unit in 2018.\nBoth the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes include customary covenants and events of default. Refer to Note 11, Debt,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussions of covenants for the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes. Based upon management's current plans and outlook, the Company believes it will be able to comply with these covenants during the subsequent twelve months.\nOverview: Manitowoc is a leading provider of engineered lifting solutions, including lattice-boom cranes, tower cranes, mobile telescopic cranes and boom trucks. The Company has three reportable segments, the Americas segment, EURAF segment, and MEAP segment. The segments were identified using the management approach,\u201d which designates the internal organization that is used by the CEO, who is also the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker, for making decisions about the allocation of resources and assessing performance.\nmanagement's current plans and outlook, the Company believes it will be able to comply with these covenants during the subsequent twelve months.\nThe table below shows a summary of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nThe aggregate scheduled maturities of outstanding debt obligations in subsequent years are as follows:\nThe Company has three reporting units: Americas, EURAF and MEAP.\nE. Written options on non-financial assets (for example, real estate puts). We do not have any written options on non-financial assets.\nEURAF net sales increased 8.2% in 2018 to $680.6 million from $628.9 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to higher demand for cranes in the commercial construction end market. EURAF net sales were also favorably impacted by approximately $24.0 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nCrane revenue is primarily generated through the sale of new and used cranes. Contracts with customers are generally in the form of a purchase order. Based on the nature of the Company's contracts, the Company does not have any significant financing terms. Contracts may have variable consideration in the form of early pay discounts or rebates.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\nEngineering, Selling and Administrative Expenses\n (2) Other (income) expense - net includes the settlement of a legal matter, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, other components of net periodic pension costs, pension settlement charges and other miscellaneous items. \nManagement also considers the following regarding liquidity and capital resources to identify trends, demands, commitments, events and uncertainties that require disclosure:\n \u2022 The table of contractual maturities above does not agree to the Company's total debt as of December 31, 2019 as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Note 11, Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements due to $4.5 million of deferred financing costs related to the 2026 Notes. \nPlease refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d where the Company has disclosed environmental, health, safety, contingencies and other matters.\nGiven the nature of the Company's products, from time to time, the customer may request that the product be held until a delivery location is identified. Under these bill and hold\u201d arrangements, revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: 1) the reason for the bill-and-hold arrangement is substantive, 2) the product is separately identified as belonging to the customer, 3) the product is ready for transfer to the customer, and 4) the Company does not have the ability to use the product or direct it to another customer.\nWarranties - In the normal course of business, the Company provides its customers warranties covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products manufactured. Such warranties generally provide that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from 12 months to 60 months with certain equipment having longer-term warranties. If a product fails to comply with the Company's warranties, it may be obligated, at its expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product. The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its warranties at the time product revenue is recognized based on historical warranty experience for the related product or estimates of projected losses due to specific warranty issues on new products. These costs primarily include labor and materials, as necessary, associated with repair or replacement. The primary factors that affect the Company's warranty liabilities include the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates or warranty claims. As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amounts as necessary.\nIn 2019, cash contributions by the Company to defined benefit pension plans were $9.0 million, and the Company estimates that its contributions will be approximately $11.1 million in 2020. Cash contributions to the Company's 401(k) plan was $6.1 million in 2019.\n\n", "item_7_text": "Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes under the guidance of ASC Topic 740-10, Income Taxes.\u201d Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance that represents a reserve on deferred tax assets for which utilization is not more likely than not. Management judgment is required in determining its provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets. The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and non-U.S. income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities, including steel, copper, aluminum, and petroleum-based products. The Company's business is subject to the effect of changing raw material costs caused by movements in underlying commodity prices. The Company has established programs to manage the negotiations of commodity prices. From time to time the Company may use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. No commodity financial instruments were entered into or outstanding during 2019 and 2018.\nCash flows provided by investing activities were $534.4 million in 2018. Cash provided by investing activities in 2018 primarily consisted of $553.1 million of cash collections on accounts receivable sold to the Company's securitization program and $13.0 million of cash proceeds on the sale of property, plant and equipment. This was partially offset by capital expenditures of $31.7 million.\n \u2022 invest in new processes, products and technology and \nAccounts Receivable Securitization and Other Financing Arrangements\nMEAP\nThe Company's debt position at various times increases our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, and results in a meaningful portion of our cash flows from operations being used for payment of interest on our debt. This could potentially limit the Company's ability to respond to market conditions or take advantage of future business opportunities. The Company's ability to service its debt is dependent upon many factors, some of which are not subject to its control, such as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors. In addition, the Company's ability to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility in the future will depend on the Company meeting the financial covenants contained in the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, even after taking into account such new borrowings.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 4.9% to $344.1 million compared to $328.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to favorable price realization and mix. This was partially offset by $10.8 million of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe 2017 effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by the release of the French valuation allowance, Internal Revenue Service audit closure, and U.S. tax reform.\n \u2022 Compensation increase - The Company's compensation increase assumptions reflect its long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. \nIn Management's Discussion and Analysis, unless otherwise indicated, references to Manitowoc\u201d and the Company\u201d refer to The Manitowoc Company, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nCash flows provided by financing activities during 2019 totaled $3.7 million and consisted primarily of $300.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of new high-yield notes (i.e., the 2026 Notes), partially offset by payments of $276.6 million to terminate the prior high-yield notes, $8.3 million of debt issuance costs on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes, $7.4 million from the repurchase of the Company's common stock and $4.4 million of payments on other debt.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe 2019 effective tax rate equaled the U.S. statutory rate of 21%. The rate was favorably impacted primarily by manufacturing and research incentives and non-U.S. income taxed at a rate other than the U.S. statutory rate. The rate was unfavorably impacted primarily by additional valuation allowances recorded during the year and U.S. tax reform.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of Americas, EURAF, and MEAP. Further information regarding the Company's reportable segments can be found in Note 17, Segments,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into agreements where the customer has the right to exercise a buyback option for the repurchase of a crane by the Company at an agreed upon price. The Company evaluates each agreement at the inception of the order to determine if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right. If it is determined that the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right, the agreement is accounted for as a lease in accordance with ASC Topic 842 - Leases.\u201d If it is determined that the customer does not have a significant economic incentive to exercise that right, then revenue is recognized when control of the asset is transferred to the customer.\n (1) Other non-recurring charges primarily includes losses from a long-term note receivable resulting from the 2014 divesture of the Company's Chinese joint venture and other non-recurring charges included in engineering, selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \nThe Company monitors market conditions to determine if any additional interim reviews of goodwill, other intangibles or long-lived assets are warranted. Deterioration in the market or actual results as compared with the Company's projections may ultimately result in a future impairment. In the event the Company determines that assets are impaired in the future, the Company would recognize a non-cash impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Results of Operations.\n \u2022 Unrecognized tax benefits totaling $11.5 million as of December 31, 2019, excluding related interest and penalties, are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. See Note 13, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures surrounding uncertain income tax positions under ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes.\u201d \nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nAftermarket part sales are generated through the sale of new and used parts to end customers and distributors. Aftermarket parts revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Control transfers to the customer generally upon delivery to the carrier. Customers generally have a right of return which the Company estimates using historical information. The amount of estimated returns is deducted from revenue.\nAdditionally, the ABL Revolving Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio under certain circumstances set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement.\n \u2022 We have disclosed our accounts receivable securitization arrangement in Note 12, Accounts Receivable Securitization and Other Factoring Arrangements\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nCash flows used for financing activities during 2018 totaled $1.3 million and consisted of payments on debt of $3.8 million, partially offset by the exercise of stock options of $2.5 million.\nDue to the Company's historic losses, impacts from U.S. tax reform and full valuation allowances, the effective annual tax rate is not a meaningful measure of the Company's cash tax position or performance of the business.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuating interest rates for our debt. At any time, the Company could be party to various interest rate swaps in connection with its fixed or floating rate debt. No interest rate swaps were entered into or outstanding during 2019 and 2018.\nThe Company used the initial extension of credit under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, together with the net proceeds from the offering of the 2026 Notes, to (i) redeem all of the Company's $260.0 million in outstanding 12.750% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2021 (the Prior 2021 Notes\u201d); (ii) repay all obligations outstanding, and terminate all commitments, under (x) the Company's previous $225.0 million ABL Revolving Credit Facility ( Prior ABL Facility\u201d) and (y) $75.0 million AR Securitization Facility; and (iii) pay related fees and expenses, including $16.6 million of call premium on the Prior 2021 Notes, $5.0 million of closing costs and $4.6 million of accrued interest.\nProduct Liability - The Company is subject, in the normal course of business, to product liability lawsuits. To the extent permitted under applicable laws, the Company's exposure to losses from these lawsuits is mitigated by insurance with self-insurance retention limits. The Company records product liability reserves for its self-insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability actions. The Company's reserve is based upon two estimates. First, the Company has tracked the population of all outstanding pending and threatened product liability cases to determine an appropriate case reserve for each\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nA. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and indenture governing the 2026 Notes require us to comply with certain financial ratios and tests. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2019, the latest measurement date. The occurrence of any default of these covenants could result in acceleration of any outstanding balances under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. Further, such acceleration would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing our 2026 Notes and other debt and could trigger cross default provisions in other agreements.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies and the financial instruments that we use, please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\u201d and Note 11, Debt,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRestructuring Expense\n \u2022 Discount Rate - The Company's discount rate assumptions are based on the interest rate of noncallable high-quality corporate bonds, with appropriate consideration of our pension plans' participants' demographics and benefit payment terms. The Company's discount rate is provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high-quality bonds. \nAsset Impairment Expense\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRevenue is earned under these contracts when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Control transfers to the customer generally upon delivery to the carrier or acceptance through an independent inspection company that acts as an agent of the customer.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $16.7 million outstanding of other indebtedness with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 5.1%. This debt includes balances on local credit lines and capital lease obligations.\nOur disclosures concerning transactions, arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources are as follows:\nOn March 25, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee and notes collateral agent, pursuant to which the Company issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured second lien notes due on April 1, 2026 with an annual coupon rate of 9.000% (the 2026 Notes\u201d). Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2026 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured second lien basis, jointly and severally, by each of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries that is either a guarantor or a borrower under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or that guarantees certain other debt of the Company or a guarantor. The 2026 Notes and the related guarantees are secured on a second-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, by pledges of capital stock and other equity interests and other security interests in substantially all of the personal property and fee-owned real property of the Company and of the guarantors that secure obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. The 2026 Notes were sold pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933.\n \u2022 maintain high-quality production standards. \n \u2022 Expected Return on Plan Assets - The Company's expected return on plan assets assumptions are based on the Company's expectation of the long-term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds, which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds. \nRecent Accounting Changes and Pronouncements\nMEAP operating income decreased 4.8% in 2018 to $31.5 million from $33.1 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to unfavorable geographic product mix within the MEAP segment and approximately $2.5 million of increased raw material input costs, partially offset by approximately $0.4 million of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, there was a $3.6 million loss in 2018 from a long-term note receivable resulting from the 2014 divestiture of the Company's Chinese joint venture.\nEmployee Benefit Plans - The Company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement health care coverage. Plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the Company's measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement and mortality rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date. The approach the Company used to determine the annual assumptions are as follows:\nThe Company uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income, which are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), as additional metrics to evaluate the Company's performance.\nOther expense - net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $6.8 million. Other expense - net was primarily composed of $7.2 million of pension benefit costs. This was partially offset by $0.4 million of foreign currency transaction gains.\nThe Company uses adjusted operating cash flows and free cash flows of continuing operations, which are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as additional metrics to evaluate the Company's performance. Adjusted operating cash flows is defined as cash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations plus cash receipts on sold accounts receivable and other one-time items. Free cash flows are defined as adjusted operating cash flows less capital expenditures. The reconciliation of cash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations to adjusted operating cash flows and further to free cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are summarized as follows:\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has two non-U.S. accounts receivable financing programs. During 2019, the Company increased the maximum limit that can be sold and outstanding under these programs from \u20ac45 million to \u20ac55 million. Under these financing programs, the Company has the ability to sell eligible receivables up to the maximum limit and can sell additional receivables as previously sold receivables are collected. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold \u20ac193.6 million of receivables and received cash of \u20ac193.6 million. Transactions under the program were accounted for as sales in accordance with Topic 860.\nof revenue growth rates and projected operating income, and an unfavorable change in those assumptions could put goodwill at risk for impairment in future periods.\nCash Flows\nThe 2018 effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by the release of the unrecognized tax benefits reserve of $6.9 million and the release of the U.K valuation allowance of $12.3 million. In addition, the U.S. recognized a tax benefit of $7.8 million during the year related to deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was not recorded.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nGross profit percentage remained flat year over year due to increased raw material input costs that were offset by strategic price increases.\nSee further detail at Note 13, Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash flows provided by investing activities were $381.3 million in 2017. Cash provided by investing activities in 2017 primarily consisted of $402.8 million of cash collections on accounts receivable sold to the Company's securitization program and $7.0 million of cash proceeds on the sale of property, plant and equipment. This was partially offset by capital expenditures of $28.9 million.\n \u2022 Other Revenues \n\nCommodity Prices\n o Training and technical publications. \nLiquidity\nThe Company's revolving credit facility, or other future facilities, may be used for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, funding future acquisitions (within the Company's debt limitations), and other operating, investing and financing needs. The Company believes that its available cash, ABL Revolving Credit Facility, cash generated from future operations, and access to public debt and equity markets will be adequate to fund its capital and debt financing requirements for the foreseeable future.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $39.1 million versus $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense was relatively flat due to a consistent average debt balance and interest rate. Amortization expense for deferred financing fees was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.9 million in 2017. See further detail at Note 11, Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations in 2018 were $512.8 million and were primarily driven by trade receivables sold to the prior accounts receivable securitization program resulting in $553.1 million of cash flows being reported in cash provided by investing activities and a $10.8 million net increase in other working capital since December 31, 2017. This was partially offset by a $51.1 million increase in net income excluding adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to operating cash flows from operating activities.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAll dollar amounts are in millions throughout the tables included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations unless otherwise indicated.\nConsolidated net sales decreased 0.7% in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to $44.3 million of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower shipments of cranes for the energy end market in the MEAP segment. This was partially offset by an increase in crane shipments primarily in North America.\nSegment Operating Performance\nBoth the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the 2026 Notes include customary covenants which include, without limitation, restrictions on the Company's ability and the ability of the Company's restricted subsidiaries to incur, assume or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred shares, pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of the Company's capital stock or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, sell or transfer certain assets, create liens on certain assets to secure debt, consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates and designate the Company's subsidiaries as unrestricted. Both the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the 2026 Notes also include customary events of default.\nbased upon its best judgment and the advice of legal counsel. These estimates are continually evaluated and adjusted based upon changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding the case. Second, the Company determined the amount of additional reserve required to cover incurred, but not reported, product liability issues and to account for possible adverse development of the established case reserves (collectively referred to as IBNR\u201d). The Company has established a position within the actuarially determined range, which it believes is the best estimate of the IBNR liability.\nNet Sales\nEURAF operating income decreased in 2018 to a loss of $68.2 million from income of $5.1 million in 2017. This change was mainly due to a goodwill asset impairment charge of $82.2 million. Excluding this item, operating income increased $8.9 million or 174.5%. This increase was primarily due to increased revenues as discussed above, strategic pricing actions on crane sales and $5.5 million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This was partially offset by $2.0 million of increased engineering, selling and administrative costs due to trade shows in 2018 that did not occur in 2017 and increased raw material input costs of $8.0 million.\nThe Company has manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world and therefore makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various currencies, which introduces transactional currency exchange risk.\nCash flows provided by investing activities were $108.4 million in 2019. Cash provided by investing activities in 2019 consisted of $126.3 million of cash collections on accounts receivable sold to the Company's securitization program and $17.2 million of cash proceeds on the sale of property, plant and equipment. This was partially offset by $35.1 million of capital expenditures.\nAs a result of favorable price realization and mix, gross profit percentage increased in 2019 to 18.8% from 17.8% in 2018.\nAs of October 31, 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived assets impairment tests, and based on those results, no impairment was indicated. The valuation of the goodwill is particularly sensitive to management's assumptions\nSee further details at Note 12, Accounts Receivable Securitization and Other Financing Arrangements\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n o Repair and field service work; and \nAt December 31, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled $4.0 million. We also had buyback commitments with a balance outstanding of $28.5 million as of December 31, 2019. This amount is not reduced for amounts the Company would recover from the repossession and subsequent resale of collateral.\nMEAP net sales decreased 22.6% in 2019 to $219.5 million from $283.5 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipments of cranes for the energy end markets. MEAP net sales were also unfavorably impacted by approximately $9.2 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company measures and records income tax contingency accruals under the guidance of ASC Topic 740-10. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as the Company must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, expirations due to statutes, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual.\n\nThe Company also reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-5, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d ASC Topic 360-10-5 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and to evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line depreciation method for financial reporting and on accelerated methods for income tax purposes.\n* Measure not meaningful\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under the caption Recent Accounting Changes and Pronouncements,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAmericas\nWith the enactment of U.S. tax reform, the Company believes that its offshore cash can be accessed in a more tax efficient manner. During 2018, the Company updated its assertion that foreign earnings are permanently reinvested such that jurisdictions where cash can be tax efficiently repatriated are no longer permanently reinvested. These earnings, if repatriated to the U.S., would not result in material tax expense. However, the Company does record deferred tax liabilities related to non-U.S. withholding taxes on these unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\n \u2022 Health Care Cost Trend Rates - The Company's health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. \nRestructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $12.9 million compared to $27.2 million in 2017. The costs for 2018 related primarily to severance costs for the departure of an executive officer, costs associated with training of skilled labor as a result of the transfer of crawler production to Shady Grove, PA and costs associated with headcount reductions in Europe. The costs for 2017 related primarily to the closure of manufacturing operations in Manitowoc, WI and Passo Fundo, Brazil and severance costs associated with headcount reductions in North America. See further detail at Note 20, Restructuring\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets - The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under the guidance of ASC Topic 350-10, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d Under ASC Topic 350-10, goodwill is not amortized; instead, the Company performs an annual impairment review. The date for the annual impairment review is October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. To perform its goodwill impairment review, the Company uses a fair-value method, primarily the income approach, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Goodwill impairment is determined by the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. To perform its indefinite lived intangible assets impairment test, the Company uses a fair-value method, based on a relief of royalty valuation approach. Management's judgments and assumptions about the amounts of those cash flows and the discount rates are inputs to these analyses. The estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset. Goodwill and other intangible assets are then subject to risk of write-down to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.\nOther intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Definite lived intangible assets are also subject to impairment testing whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If an indicator of impairment were identified, the Company would use the income approach, which is based on the present value of expected future cash flows.\nAdditionally, on March 25, 2019, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company (the Loan Parties\u201d) entered into a credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement\u201d) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A as administrative and collateral agent, and certain financial institutions party thereto as lenders, providing for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) of up to $275.0 million. The borrowing capacity under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is based on the value of inventory, accounts receivable and fixed assets of the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties' obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are secured on a first-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, by substantially all of the personal property and fee-owned real property of the Loan Parties. The liens securing the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are senior in priority to the second-priority liens securing the obligations under the 2026 Notes and the related guarantees. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility has a term of 5 years and includes a $75.0 million letter of credit sub-facility, $10.0 million of which is available to the Company's German subsidiary that is a borrower under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company records revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d Below are our revenue recognition policies by performance obligation.\nInterest Expense & Amortization of Deferred Financing Fees\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes. In preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements giving due consideration to materiality. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Although the Company has listed a number of accounting policies below which the Company believes to be most critical, the Company also believes that all of the Company's accounting policies are important to the reader. Therefore, please refer also to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed description of these and other accounting policies of the Company.\nC. Factors specific to us and our markets that we expect to be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect our ability to raise short-term and long-term financing. We do not presently believe that events covered by these risk factors applicable to our business could materially affect our credit ratings or could adversely affect our ability to raise short-term or long-term financing.\nEURAF\n \u2022 The table of scheduled maturities above does not agree to the Company's total debt as of December 31, 2019 as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Note 11, Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements due to $4.5 million of deferred financing costs related to the 2026 Notes. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $25.0 million charge associated with the refinancing of the Company's prior credit facility and notes. The charge is composed of $16.6 million of call premium on the prior notes, $5.3 million of unamortized discount on the prior notes and $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nMeasurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year-end measurements of assets and obligations. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions when appropriate. As required by GAAP, the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods. The Company has developed the assumptions with the assistance of its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, and believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 21, Employee Benefit Plans\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a summary of the impact of a 0.50% change in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets would have on the Company's financial statements.\nBorrowings under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate using either the Alternative Base Rate or the Eurodollar and Overnight London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). The variable interest rate is based upon the average quarterly availability as of the most recent determination date as follows:\nGross Profit\ndecreased $10.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in restructuring expense and $2.3 million of incremental trade show costs in 2019. This was also impacted unfavorably by $4.3 million of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nTo mitigate transactional currency exchange risk, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into foreign exchange contracts to 1) reduce the earnings and cash flows impact on non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables and 2) reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates between a budgeted rate and the rate realized at the time we recognize a particular purchase or sale transaction. Gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments either impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of the underlying purchase or sale transaction, or offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying receivables and payables being hedged. The maturities of these foreign exchange contracts coincide with the expected underlying settlement date of the related cash inflow or outflow. The hedges of anticipated transactions are designated as cash flow hedges under the guidance of ASC No. 815 Derivatives and Hedging.\u201d At December 31, 2019, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of $32.6 million, all of which are carried on the Company's balance sheet at fair value. As of December 31, 2019, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in the Company's portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased the Company's unrealized losses by $3.3 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company had maintained a Receivables Purchase Agreement among Manitowoc Funding, LLC ( MTW Funding\u201d), as Seller, The Manitowoc Company, Inc., as Servicer, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Purchaser and as Agent, with a commitment size of $75.0 million (the RPA\u201d). Under the RPA (and the related Purchase and Sale Agreements referenced in the RPA), the Company's domestic trade accounts receivable were sold to MTW Funding which, in turn, sold, conveyed, transferred and assigned to a third-party financial institution, all of MTW Funding's rights, title and interest in a pool of receivables to the Purchaser. Transactions under the program were accounted for as sales in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing\u201d ( Topic 860\u201d). This program was terminated on March 25, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants in its debt instruments, inclusive of the financial covenants pertaining to the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes. Based upon\nCapital Expenditures\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $32.7 million versus $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction of the average effective interest rate from 11.9% in 2018 to 10.1% in 2019. The decrease in the average effective interest rate was primarily due to the refinancing of the Company's debt completed in the first quarter of 2019. Amortization expense for deferred financing fees was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.8 million in 2018. See further detail at Note 11, Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther income - net for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $9.8 million. Other income - net was primarily composed of a $15.5 million benefit related to a settlement of a legal matter and a $3.5 million gain on the sale of the Company's Manitowoc, Wisconsin manufacturing facility. This was partially offset by $4.4 million of pension benefit costs and $5.5 million of foreign currency transaction losses.\nA summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 is as follows:\nAmericas operating income increased 92.9% in 2019 to $113.4 million from $58.8 million in 2018. This change was primarily due to increased revenues as discussed above, price realization, $8.3 million of lower engineering, selling and administrative costs due primarily to cost reduction actions, $3.3 million of lower restructuring expenses and better utilization of the U.S. manufacturing facilities.\nWe are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates, commodities and foreign currency exchange rates. To reduce these risks, we selectively use derivative financial instruments and other proactive management techniques. We have written policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of corporate finance and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes. The use of financial instruments for trading purposes or speculation is strictly prohibited.\nFinancial Risk Management\nEngineering, selling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $26.0 million to $225.6 million. The decrease was primarily due to the settlement of a legal matter, which included a $8.9 million recovery of legal fees expensed in previous periods, $6.8 million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and cost reduction actions.\n \u2022 improve the cost structure of the Company's business, \n \u2022 Retirement and Mortality Rates - The Company's retirement and mortality rate assumptions are based primarily on actual plan experience and mortality tables. \n \u2022 Aftermarket Part Sales \n\nD. We have disclosed information related to certain guarantees in Note 19, Guarantees,\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAmounts invested in non-U.S. based subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at year-end. Results of operations are translated into U.S. dollars at an average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders' equity as other comprehensive income (loss). The cumulative translation adjustment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2019 was a loss of $81.1 million.\nThe Company believes its liquidity and expected cash flows from operations should be sufficient to meet expected working capital, capital expenditure and other general ongoing operational needs in the foreseeable future.\nCash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations in 2017 were $324.3 million and were primarily driven by trade receivables sold to the prior accounts receivable securitization program resulting in $402.8 million of cash flows being reported in cash provided by investing activities. This was partially offset by a $63.1 million decrease in working capital since December 31, 2016 and a $15.4 million increase in net income excluding adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to operating cash flows from operating activities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $25.0 million charge in the Consolidated Statement of Operations associated with the Company's refinancing of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes. The charge is composed of $16.6 million of call premium on the Prior 2021 Notes, $5.3 million of unamortized discount on the Prior 2021 Notes and $3.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nAsset impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $82.6 million compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to a $82.2 million goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the EURAF reporting unit in 2018.\nThe Company's other revenues consist primarily of revenues from:\nEnvironmental, Health, Safety, Contingencies and Other Matters\nDebt\nInventories and Related Reserve for Obsolete and Excess Inventory - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. Inventories are reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimated reserve is based upon specific identification of excess or obsolete inventories based on historical usage, estimated future usage, sales requiring the inventory and historical write-off experience and are subject to change if experience improves or deteriorates.\nThe Company funds capital expenditures that are intended to:\n\n \u2022 We have disclosed in Note 19, Guarantees,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements our buyback commitments. \nEURAF operating income increased in 2019 to income of $3.8 million from a loss of $68.2 million in 2018. This change was mainly due to a goodwill asset impairment charge of $82.2 million recorded in 2018. Excluding this item, operating income\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus the addback of restructuring and other charges. The Company defines adjusted operating income as adjusted EBITDA excluding the addback of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide important supplemental information to readers regarding business trends that can be used in evaluating its results of operations because these financial measures provide a consistent method of comparing financial performance and are commonly used by investors to assess performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and are not substitutes for, the GAAP financial information provided herein.\nCurrency Risk\nMEAP net sales increased 9.5% in 2018 to $283.5 million from $258.8 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to shipments of cranes for the commercial construction and energy end markets. MEAP net sales were also favorably impacted by approximately $3.0 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 16.4% to $328.1 million compared to $281.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This change was due to increased net sales as discussed above.\nThe reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDA, and further to adjusted EBITDA, and to adjusted operating income and operating income (loss) is as follows:\nAmericas net sales increased 27.3% in 2018 to $882.7 million from $693.6 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to increased crane shipments to the commercial construction and energy end markets.\nAs it relates to the Company's other revenues, the Company's performance obligations generally relate to performing specific agreed upon services. Revenue is earned upon the completion of those services.\nMEAP operating income decreased 28.3% in 2019 to $22.6 million from $31.5 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipments of cranes as discussed above and a $2.1 million increase in restructuring expenses compared to 2018. This was partially offset by $4.2 million of lower engineering, selling and administrative costs primarily due to cost reduction actions.\nB. Circumstances that could impair our ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential, or that could render that activity commercially impracticable, such as the inability to maintain a specified credit rating, level of earnings, earnings per share, financial ratios, or collateral. We do not believe that these risk factors are reasonably likely to impair our ability to continue to engage in our planned activities at this time.\nCash flows used for operating activities of continuing operations in 2019 were $53.3 million and were primarily driven by trade receivables sold to the prior accounts receivable securitization program resulting in $126.3 million of cash flows being reported in cash provided by investing activities and $75.0 million of purchases of accounts receivable previously sold to the prior accounts receivable securitization program. This was partially offset by $116.5 million increase in net income excluding adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to operating cash flows from operating activities, a $31.5 million net reduction in working capital since December 31, 2018 and $24.4 million of net cash received from the settlement of a legal matter.\nAmericas net sales increased 9.9% in 2019 to $969.7 million from $882.7 million in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by market expansion in petrochemical and utility segments along with fleet replenishment. Share gains were also realized in several product lines, aided by positive market acceptance of new product introductions.\n\nCash flows used for financing activities during 2017 totaled $9.7 million and consisted primarily of $15.6 million of long-term debt payments partially offset by $5.7 million of proceeds from stock option exercises.\nAmericas operating income increased 764.7% in 2018 to $58.8 million from $6.8 million in 2017. This change was primarily due to $14.3 million of lower restructuring expenses, $2.0 million of lower engineering, selling and administrative costs, better utilization of the U.S. manufacturing facilities and increased revenues as discussed above. This was partially offset by increased raw material costs of $4.5 million.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\n \u2022 Crane Revenue \nRestructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $9.8 million compared to $12.9 million in 2018. The costs for 2019 related primarily to severance costs for headcount reductions in Europe, North America and India.\nOther expense - net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11.5 million. Other expense - net was primarily composed of a $4.5 million non-cash pension settlement charge, $5.0 million of pension benefit costs and $2.8 million of foreign currency transaction losses. This was partially offset by $1.2 million of gains related to the sale of property, plant and equipment.\nThe Company spent a total of $35.1 million during 2019 for capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2019, depreciation was $35.0 million.\nEURAF net sales decreased 5.2% in 2019 to $644.9 million from $680.6 million in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to $34.7 million of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOther income (expense) - Net\nThe Company's liquidity positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows:\nEngineering, selling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $6.3 million to $251.6 million. This increase was primarily due to a $3.6 million loss from a long-term note receivable resulting from the 2014 divestiture of the Company's Chinese joint venture. This was partially offset by lower trade show expenses in 2018. Further information regarding the Chinese joint venture note receivable can be found in Note 7, Notes Receivable\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of the Company's employees and retirees. The Board of Directors has established the Retirement Plan Committee to manage the operations and administration of all benefit plans and related trusts. For further information see Note 21, Employee Benefit Plans\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had no borrowings outstanding on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the highest daily borrowing was $39.7 million and the average borrowing was $8.9 million, while the average annual interest rate was 4.15%. The interest rate of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility fluctuates based on excess availability. As of December 31, 2019, the spreads for Eurodollar and Overnight LIBOR and Alternative Base Rate borrowings were 1.25% and 0.25%, respectively, with excess availability of approximately $206.4 million, which represents revolver borrowing capacity of $210.4 million less U.S. letters of credit outstanding of $4.0 million.\n\nConsolidated net sales increased 16.8% in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher crane shipments across all regions. Consolidated net sales were also favorably impacted by approximately $27.0 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAsset impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was zero compared to $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Such warranties generally provide that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from 12 months to 60 months with certain equipment having longer-term warranties. If a product fails to comply with the Company's warranties, it may be obligated, at its expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product. The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its warranties at the time product revenue is recognized based on historical warranty experience for the related product or estimates of projected losses due to specific warranty issues on new products. These costs primarily include labor and materials, as necessary, associated with repair or replacement. The primary factors that affect the Company's warranty liabilities include the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates or warranty claims. As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amounts as necessary.\nIn 2019, cash contributions by the Company to defined benefit pension plans were $9.0 million, and the Company estimates that its contributions will be approximately $11.1 million in 2020.

The decrease was mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and lower crane shipments in the MEAP segment, partially offset by higher crane shipments in the Americas.\n\n- Operating income was $108.4 million in 2019, up from a loss of $19.3 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to lower restructuring costs, the prior year goodwill impairment charge in EURAF, and increased sales and profitability in the Americas segment. \n\n- Net income from continuing operations was $46.6 million in 2019 compared to a loss of $66.9 million in 2018. The improvement was driven by higher operating income.\n\n- Cash flows from operations were negative $53.3 million in 2019 due to the accounts receivable securitization program, which resulted in receivables collections being classified as cash from investing activities. Adjusted cash flows from operations were $148 million. \n\n- Total debt was $316.7 million. The company refinanced its debt in Q1 2019, issuing $300 million in new senior secured notes and entering a new $275 million asset-based revolving credit facility. \n\n- The company has three reporting segments - Americas, EURAF, and MEAP. Operating performance varied by segment but improved overall from 2018.\n\n- Key drivers impacting the business include global crane demand, raw material costs, restructuring initiatives, currency exchange rates, and new product development. The company is focused on improving its cost structure and cash flows."}
