The purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant factors affecting the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company does not engage in any material business activities apart from its ownership of the Banks. Products and services offered by the Banks are for commercial and consumer purposes, including loans, deposits and wealth management services. Some Banks also offer investment services through a third-party broker-dealer. The Company employs 17 individuals to assist with financial reporting, human resources, marketing, audit, compliance, technology systems, property appraisals, training and the coordination of management activities, in addition to 254 full-time equivalent individuals employed by the Banks.\nThe Company's primary competitive strategy is to utilize seasoned and competent Bank management and local decision-making authority to provide customers with prompt response times and flexibility in the products and services offered. This strategy is viewed as providing an opportunity to increase revenues through the creation of a competitive advantage over other financial institutions. The Company also strives to remain operationally efficient to improve profitability while enabling the Banks to offer more competitive loan and deposit rates.\nThe principal sources of Company revenues and cash flows are: (i) interest and fees earned on loans made or held by the Company and Banks; (ii) interest on investments, primarily on bonds, held by the Banks; (iii) fees on wealth management services; (iv) service charges on deposit accounts maintained at the Banks; (v) merchant and card fees; (vi) gain on the sale of loans held for sale; and (vii) securities gains. The Company's principal expenses are: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) salaries and employee benefits; (iii) data processing costs primarily associated with maintaining the Banks' loan and deposit functions; (iv) occupancy expenses for maintaining the Banks' facilities; (v) professional fees; and (vi) business development. The largest component contributing to the Company's net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets (primarily loans and investments) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposit accounts and other borrowings). One of management's principal functions is to manage the spread between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities in an effort to maximize net interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of interest rate risk.\nThe Company reported net income of $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This represents an increase in net income of 26.9% when comparing 2021 with 2020. The improvement in earnings in 2021 from 2020 is primarily the result of a decrease in provision for loan losses due to a significantly higher level of provision in 2020 as a result of uncertainties associated with the economic slow-down created by the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in interest expense due to declines in market interest rates. Earnings per share for 2021 were $2.62 compared to $2.06 in 2020. All six Banks demonstrated profitable operations during 2021 and 2020.\nThe Company's return on average equity for 2021 was 11.43% compared to 9.48% in 2020. The return on average assets for 2021 was 1.15% compared to 1.01% in 2020. The increase in return on average equity and return on average assets when comparing 2021 to 2020 was primarily a result of improved earnings.\nThe following discussion will provide a summary review of important items relating to:\nTable 44: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Challenges and COVID-19 Status, Risks and Uncertainties\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 45: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Key Performance Indicators\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 46: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Industry Results\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 47: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Critical Accounting Policies\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 48: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 49: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Income Statement Review\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 50: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Balance Sheet Review\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 51: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 52: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 53: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Interest Rate Risk\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 54: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Inflation\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 55: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Forward-Looking Statements and Business Risks\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nChallenges and COVID-19 Status, Risks and Uncertainties\nManagement has identified certain events or circumstances that have the potential to negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations in the future and is attempting to position the Company to best respond to those challenges.\nTable 56: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> If interest rates increase significantly over a relatively short period of time due to higher inflationary numbers or other factors, the interest rate environment may present a challenge to the Company. Increases in interest rates may negatively impact the Company's net interest margin if interest expense increases more quickly than interest income, thus placing downward pressure on net interest income. The Company's earning assets (primarily its loan and investment portfolio) have longer maturities than its interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and other borrowings); therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, interest expense will tend to increase more quickly than interest income as the interest-bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than earning assets, resulting in a reduction in net interest income. In response to this challenge, the Banks model quarterly the changes in income that would result from various changes in interest rates. Based on this modeling, management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks' interest rate risk positions.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 57: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> If market interest rates in the three to five year term remain at low levels as compared to the short term interest rates, the interest rate environment may present a challenge to the Company. The Company's earning assets (typically priced at market interest rates in the three to five year range) will reprice at lower interest rates, but the deposits will not reprice at significantly lower interest rates, therefore the net interest income may decrease. Management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks' interest rate risk positions.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 58: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The agricultural community is subject to commodity price fluctuations. Extended periods of low commodity prices, higher input costs or poor weather conditions could result in reduced profit margins, reducing demand for goods and services provided by agriculture-related businesses, which, in turn, could affect other businesses in the Company's market area. Moreover, changes in U.S. trade policy could create further volatility for commodities prices as the volume of exports of agricultural products to these foreign markets could be adversely impacted. Lastly, uncertainty regarding governmental mandates affecting ethanol production could reduce the demand for corn in the Company's trade area, thus introducing further price volatility for this commodity. Any combination of these factors could produce losses within the Company's agricultural loan portfolio and in the commercial loan portfolio with respect to borrowers whose businesses are directly or indirectly impacted by the health of the agricultural economy. Such losses could result in an accelerated level of charge-offs and the need to increase provision expenses, thus resulting in reduced earnings.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThe onset and continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the level of challenges, risks and uncertainties facing our business and continuation of operations, including the following:\nTable 59: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Some of the Company's customers may experience decreased revenues due to the continued economic disruptions caused by the pandemic, which may correlate to an inability to make timely loan payments or maintain payrolls. This, in turn, could adversely impact the revenues and earnings of the Company by, among other things, requiring further increases in the allowance for loan losses and increases in the level of charge-offs in the loan portfolio. Management anticipates additional increases in the allowance if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts the loan portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 60: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Market interest rates remained low throughout 2021, but are expected to increase during the course of 2022 in response to inflationary pressures on the economy which could adversely affect our net interest income, net interest margin and earnings;\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 61: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> We may experience a potential slowdown in demand for our products and services, including the demand for traditional loans, although we believe the decline may be offset, in whole or in part, due to inflation and higher interest rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 62: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> We may experience an increase in risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, as well as declining collateral values and further impairment of the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, all of which may result in additional credit charges and other losses in our loan portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 63: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Goodwill is currently evaluated for impairment quarterly and goodwill has been determined to not be impaired as of December 31, 2021.

The Company's return on assets ratio was slightly lower the industry average for 2021.\nTable 68: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Return on Equity\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average equity. It is used to measure the net income or return the Company generated for the shareholders' equity investment in the Company. The Company's return on equity ratio was similar to the industry average for 2021.\nTable 69: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Net Interest Margin\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets. Earning assets consist primarily of loans and investments that earn interest. This ratio is used to measure how well the Company maintains interest rates on earning assets above those of interest-bearing liabilities, which is the interest expense paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings. The Company's net interest margin was lower than the industry average for 2021.\nTable 70: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Efficiency Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. The ratio is a measure of the Company's ability to manage noninterest expenses. The Company's efficiency ratio was lower than the industry average for 2021.\nTable 71: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Capital Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThe capital ratio is calculated by dividing average total equity capital by average total assets. It measures the level of average assets that are funded by shareholders' equity. Given an equal level of risk in the financial condition of two companies, the higher the capital ratio, generally the more financially sound the company. The Company's capital ratio was similar to the industry average for 2021.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion contained in this Item 7 and other disclosures included within this Annual Report are based on the Company's audited consolidated financial statements which appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained in these statements is, for the most part, based on the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. However, the preparation of these statements requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d accompanying the Company's audited financial statements. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments, management has identified the allowance for loan losses, the fair value determination of investment securities and the assessment of goodwill to be the Company's most critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses that is treated as an expense and charged against earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collectability of the principal is unlikely. The Company has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan portfolio, including timely identification of potential problem loans. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses, incorporating a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss experience, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, known information about individual loans and other factors. Qualitative factors include various considerations regarding the general economic environment in the Company's market area. To the extent actual results differ from forecasts and management's judgment, the allowance for loan losses may be greater or lesser than future charge-offs. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nFor further discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses and the process of establishing specific reserves, see the section of this Annual Report entitled Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\u201d and Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nFair Value of Investment Securities\nThe Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio is carried at fair value with fair value\u201d being defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability is not adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact, and (iv) willing to transact.\nDeclines in the fair value of available-for-sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers (1) the intent to sell the investment securities and the more likely than not requirement that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities prior to recovery (2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in management's assessment of other-than-temporary impairment will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arose in connection with four acquisitions consummated in previous periods. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if conditions indicate a possible impairment. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, determination of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Impairment would arise if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The Company completed a quantitative assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2021 which indicated that goodwill was not impaired. Subsequently, the Company determined there were no adverse changes in criteria and key considerations to the previous assessment. Accordingly, the Company concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2021. Goodwill may be impaired in the future if actual future test results differ from the present evaluation of impairment due to changes in the conditions used in the current evaluation. The effects of the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our net income, fair value and correspondingly goodwill. An impairment of goodwill would decrease the Company's earnings during the period in which the impairment is recorded.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Annual Report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures include the Company's presentation of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used in the financial institutions industry and provide useful information to both management and investors to analyze and evaluate the Company's financial performance. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be considered an alternative to the Company's GAAP results. The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income and net interest margin on an FTE basis to GAAP (dollars in thousands).\nTable 72: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> Reconciliation of net interest income and annualized net interest margin on an FTE basis to GAAP:\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 73: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income (GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,843 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax-equivalent adjustment (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>965 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,808 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average interest-earning assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,008,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,784,285 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.83 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 74: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (1) Computed on a tax-equivalent basis using an incremental federal income tax rate of 21 percent for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, adjusted to reflect the effect of the nondeductible interest expense associated with owning tax-exempt securities and loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nIncome Statement Review\nThe following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last two years.\nAverage Balances and Interest Rates\nThe following two tables are used to calculate the Company's non-GAAP net interest margin on an FTE basis. The first table includes the Company's average assets and the related income to determine the average yield on earning assets. The second table includes the average liabilities and related expense to determine the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin is equal to the interest income less the interest expense divided by average earning assets.

income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The volume of and yields earned on earning assets and the volume of and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities determine net interest income. Refer to the tables preceding this paragraph for additional detail. Interest earned and interest paid is also affected by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, by government policies and the action of regulatory authorities. Net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as net interest margin. For the years December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's non-GAAP net interest margin was 2.83% and 3.13%, respectively, computed on an FTE basis. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this report.\nNet interest income during 2021 and 2020 totaled $56.0 million and $54.8 million, respectively, representing a 2.1% increase in 2021 compared to 2020. Net interest income increased in 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to a reduction in interest expense due to declines in market rates on deposits and higher PPP loan interest and related fees, offset in part by a reduction in interest rates on loans. In addition to interest income on PPP loans, fee income of $4.3 million and $2.3 million was recognized into interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe high level of competition in the local markets will continue to put downward pressure on the net interest margin of the Company. Currently, the Company's primary market in Ames, Iowa, has fourteen banks, six credit unions and several other financial investment companies. Multiple banks are also located in the Company's other market areas in central, north-central and south-central Iowa creating similarly competitive environments.\nProvision (Credit) for Loan Losses\nThe provision (credit) for loan losses reflects management's judgment of the expense to be recognized in order to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company's credit for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was ($757) thousand compared to a provision for loan losses of $5.7 million for the previous year. Net loan recoveries totaled $163 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net loan charge offs of $1.1 million for the previous year. The credit for loan losses in 2021 was primarily due to loan recoveries, a reduction in specific reserves, and improving economic conditions. The provision for loan losses in 2020 was primarily due to uncertainties associated with the economic slow-down created by the COVID-19 pandemic and a specific reserve placed on one hospitality loan in the commercial real estate portfolio. Classified loans, excluding 1-4 family and consumer loans, decreased $14.9 million to $61.4 million in 2021 primarily due to improving credit quality. Refer to the Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\u201d discussion for additional details with regard to loan loss provision expense.\nManagement believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the current portfolio. This statement is based upon management's continuing evaluation of inherent risks in the current loan portfolio, current levels of classified assets and general economic factors. The Company will continue to monitor the allowance and make future adjustments to the allowance as conditions dictate. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nNoninterest Income and Expense\nTotal noninterest income is comprised primarily of fee-based revenues from wealth management and trust services, bank-related service charges on deposit activities, net securities gains, merchant and card fees related to electronic processing of merchant and cash transactions and gain on the sale of loans held for sale.\nNoninterest income during the years ended 2021 and 2020 totaled $10.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively. The decrease in noninterest income in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to a decrease in gains on sale of residential loans held for sale as refinancing has slowed, fewer security gains, and was partially offset by an increase in wealth management income due to growth in assets under management, fueled by a favorable equity market and new account relationships.\nNoninterest expense for the Company consists of all operating expenses other than interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds. Salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of the Company's operating expenses and comprise 61% and 63% of noninterest expense in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNoninterest expense during the years ended 2021 and 2020 totaled $36.6 million for both periods. Salaries and employee benefits decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number of employees and increased deferred loan costs associated with PPP loan volume, offset in part by normal increases in salaries and other benefits, including health insurance. FDIC insurance assessments, data processing, and business development costs were higher for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The percentage of noninterest expense to average assets was 1.8% in 2021, compared to 2.0% during 2020.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for 2021 and 2020 was $6.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively. This amount represents an effective tax rate of 22.0% and 18.9%, respectively. The Company's federal income tax rate was 21% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate compared to 2020 was due to a $396 thousand deferred tax valuation allowance established in 2021 on a state tax net operating loss at the holding company. The effective tax rate in both years were also impacted by tax exempt interest income and New Markets Tax Credits.\nBalance Sheet Review\nThe Company's assets are comprised primarily of loans and investment securities. The majority of average earning asset maturity or repricing dates are generally five years or less for the combined portfolios as the assets are funded for the most part by short term deposits with either immediate availability or less than one-year average maturities. This exposes the Company to risk regarding changes in interest rates.\nTotal assets increased to $2.14 billion in 2021 compared to $1.98 billion in 2020, or 8.2%. The increase was primarily due to investment securities which was funded by growth in our deposits due in part to federal government stimulus programs and a lack of other desirable fixed income alternatives for our customers.\nLoan Portfolio\nNet loans as of December 31, 2021 totaled $1.14 billion, an increase of 1.3% from the $1.13 billion as of December 31, 2020. Loans increased primarily due to increases in the 1-4 family and commercial real estate loan portfolios, offset in part by a reduction due to forgiveness of PPP loans. PPP loans totaled $6.0 million and $50.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Loans are the primary contributor to the Company's revenues and cash flows. The average yield on loans was 241 and 202 basis points higher in 2021 and 2020, respectively, in comparison to the average tax-equivalent investment portfolio yields.\nTypes of Loans\nThe Company's loan portfolio consists of real estate, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans. As of December 31, 2021, gross loans totaled approximately $1.16 billion, which equals approximately 61.8% of total deposits and 54.3% of total assets. The Iowa State Average Report (consisting of 256 banks in the State of Iowa) loan to deposit ratio as of December 31, 2021 was 67%. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of the loans were originated directly by the Banks to borrowers within the Banks' principal market areas. There are no foreign loans outstanding during the years presented.\nReal estate loans include various types of loans for which the Banks hold real property as collateral and consist of loans primarily on commercial, agricultural, and multifamily properties and single-family residences. Real estate loans typically have fixed rates for up to five years, with the Company's loan policy permitting a maximum fixed rate maturity of up to 15 years. The majority of construction loan volume is given to contractors to construct 1-4 family residence and commercial buildings. The Banks also originate residential real estate loans for sale to the secondary market for a fee.\nCommercial loans consist primarily of loans to businesses for various purposes, including revolving lines to finance current operations, floor-plans, inventory and accounts receivable; capital expenditure loans to finance equipment and other fixed assets; and letters of credit. These loans generally have short maturities, have either adjustable or fixed rates and are unsecured or secured by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and/or real estate.\nAgricultural loans play an important part in the Banks' loan portfolios. Iowa is a major agricultural state and is a national leader in both grain and livestock production. The Banks play a significant role in their communities in financing operating, livestock and real estate activities for area producers.\nConsumer loans include loans extended to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures not secured by real estate. Most of the Banks' consumer lending is for vehicles, consolidation of personal debts and home improvements.\nThe interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk and the amount and maturity terms of the loan. Competitive pressures, market interest rates, the availability of funds and government regulation further influence the rate charged on a loan. The Banks follow a loan policy, which has been approved by both the board of directors of the Company and the Banks and is overseen by both Company and Bank management. These policies establish lending limits, review and grading criteria and other guidelines such as loan administration and allowance for loan losses. Loans are approved by the Banks' board of directors and/or designated officers in accordance with respective guidelines and underwriting policies of the Company. Credit limits generally vary according to the type of loan and the individual loan officer's experience. Loans to any one borrower are limited by applicable state and federal banking laws.\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates as of December 31, 2021\nThe contractual maturities of the Company's loan portfolio are as shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because individual borrowers may have the right to prepay loans with or without prepayment penalties (in thousands).\nTable 81: <table> <tbody>

as of December 31, 2020. Residential mortgage loans are originated by the Banks and sold to several secondary mortgage market outlets based upon customer product preferences and pricing considerations. The mortgages are sold in the secondary market to eliminate interest rate risk and to generate secondary market fee income. It is not anticipated at the present time that loans held for sale will become a significant portion of total assets.\nInvestment Portfolio\nTotal investments as of December 31, 2021 were $831.0 million, an increase of $234.0 million or 39.2% from the prior year end. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the investment portfolio comprised 39% and 30% of total assets, respectively. The increase in investments is primarily due to purchases in excess of maturities of U.S. treasuries and municipal bonds as deposit growth was deployed.\nManagement's process for obtaining and validating the fair value of investment securities is discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d which is included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment Maturities as of December 31, 2021\nThe investments in the following table are reported by contractual maturity.

basis.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's investment securities portfolio included securities issued by 298 and 279 government municipalities and agencies located within 28 and 24 states with a fair value of $292.9 million and $251.6 million, respectively. No one municipality or agency represents a concentration within this segment of the investment portfolio. Storm Lake, Iowa, general obligation bonds with a fair value of $7.3 million (approximately 2.5% of the fair value of the government municipalities and subdivisions) represent the largest exposure to any one municipality or subdivision for the Company as of December 31, 2021; the bonds are repayable from the levy of continuing annual tax on all the taxable property within the territory of the city of Storm Lake.\nThe Company's procedures for evaluating investments in states, municipalities and political subdivisions include but are not limited to reviewing the offering statement and the most current available financial information, comparing yields to yields of bonds of similar credit quality, confirming capacity to repay, assessing operating and financial performance, evaluating the stability of tax revenues, considering debt profiles and local demographics, and for revenue bonds, assessing the source and strength of revenue structures for municipal authorities. These procedures, as applicable, are utilized for all municipal purchases and are utilized in whole or in part for monitoring the portfolio of municipal holdings. The Company does not utilize third party credit rating agencies as a primary component of determining if the municipal issuer has an adequate capacity to meet the financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the investment, and, therefore, does not compare internal assessments to those of the credit rating agencies. Credit rating downgrades are utilized as an additional indicator of credit weakness and as a reference point for historical default rates.\nThe following table summarizes the total general obligation and revenue bonds in the Company's investment securities portfolios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 identifying the state in which the issuing government municipality or agency operates (in thousands):\nTable 84: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amortized\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amortized\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Value\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Obligations of states and political subdivisions:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General Obligation bonds:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Iowa\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,830 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,442 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Texas\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,927 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nebraska\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,446 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Washington\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,702 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (2021: 16 states;

The increase of $161.6 million between the periods can be primarily attributed to federal government stimulus programs and increases in core deposits, including retail and commercial funds. Balances fluctuate as customer liquidity needs vary and could be impacted by distressed economic conditions or additional government stimulus.\nThe Company's primary source of funds is customer deposits. The Banks attempt to attract noninterest-bearing deposits, which are a low-cost funding source. In addition, the Banks offer a variety of interest-bearing accounts designed to attract both short-term and longer-term deposits from customers. Interest-bearing accounts earn interest at rates established by Bank management based on competitive market factors and the Company's need for funds. While 66.0% of the Banks' certificates of deposit mature in the next year, it is anticipated that many of these certificates will be renewed. Rate sensitive certificates of deposits in excess of $250,000 are subject to somewhat higher volatility with regard to renewal volume as the Banks adjust rates based upon funding needs. In the event a substantial volume of certificates is not renewed, the Company has sufficient liquid assets and borrowing lines to fund significant runoff. A sustained reduction in deposit volume would have a significant negative impact on the Company's operations and liquidity. The Company had $7.0 million and $8.7 million of brokered deposits as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company has approximately $386.1 million of uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2021.\nAverage Deposits by Type\nThe following table sets forth the average balances for each major category of

securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements). Borrowed funds are an alternative funding source to deposits and can be used to fund the Company's assets and unforeseen liquidity needs. FHLB advances are loans from the FHLB that can mature daily or have longer maturities for fixed or floating rates of interest. Federal funds purchased are borrowings from other banks that mature daily. Repurchase agreements are similar to deposits as they are funds lent by various Bank customers; however, investment securities are pledged to secure such borrowings.

These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit that assist customers with their credit needs to conduct business. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, the most likely impact of these financial instruments on revenues, expenses, or cash flows of the Company would come from unidentified credit risk causing higher provision expense for loan losses in future periods. These financial instruments are not expected to have a significant impact on the liquidity or capital resources of the Company. For additional information, including quantification of the amounts involved, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Statements\u201d and the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of this discussion.\nAsset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\nThe Company's credit risk is centered in the loan portfolio, which on December 31, 2021, totaled $1.14 billion as compared to $1.13 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 1.3%. Net loans comprise approximately 54% of total assets as of the end of 2021. The objective in managing loan portfolio risk is to reduce the risk of loss resulting from a customer's failure to perform according to the terms of a transaction and to quantify and manage credit risk on a portfolio basis. As the following chart indicates, the Company's non-performing assets have decreased by 16% from December 31, 2020 and total $13.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The Company's level of non-performing loans as a percentage of loans of 1.11% as of December 31, 2021, is higher than the Iowa State Average peer group of FDIC insured institutions as of December 31, 2021, of 0.45%. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2021 remains adequate based on its analysis of the non-performing assets and the portfolio as a whole.\nNon-performing Assets\nThe following table sets forth information concerning the Company's non-performing assets for the past three years ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 91: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming assets:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,788 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans 90 days or more past due\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>255 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,043 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities available-for-sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,004 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,047 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.45 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112.72 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>263.55 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThe accrual of interest on nonaccrual and other impaired loans is generally discontinued at 90 days or when, in the opinion of management, the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received and when principal obligations are expected to be recoverable. Interest income on restructured loans is recognized pursuant to the terms of the new loan agreement. Interest income on other impaired loans remaining on accrual is monitored and income is recognized based upon the terms of the underlying loan agreement. However, the recorded net investment in impaired loans, including accrued interest, is limited to the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or the observable fair value of the loan's collateral.\nNon-performing loans totaled $12.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and were $2.5 million lower than the non-performing loans as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in non-performing loans was due primarily to payoffs and paydowns of loans on nonaccrual. The Company considers non-performing loans to generally include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing and other loans that may or may not meet the former nonperforming criteria but are considered to meet the definition of impaired.\nThe allowance for loan losses related to these impaired loans was approximately $1.4 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The average balances of impaired loans for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $13.2 million and $14.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest income, which would have been recorded under the original terms of nonaccrual loans, was approximately $650 thousand and $975 thousand, respectively. There was $169 thousand and $39 thousand of loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing interest as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSummary of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses represents an expense charged against earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include: an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower; a realistic determination of value and adequacy of underlying collateral; historical charge-offs; the condition of the local economy; the condition of the specific industry of the borrower; an analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories; and a review of delinquent and classified loans.\nThe adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated quarterly by management, the Company and respective Bank boards. This evaluation focuses on specific loan reviews, changes in the type and volume of the loan portfolio given the current economic conditions and historical loss experience. Any one of the following conditions may result in the review of a specific loan: concern about whether the customer's cash flow or collateral are sufficient to repay the loan; delinquent status; criticism of the loan in a regulatory examination; the accrual of interest has been suspended; or other reasons, including when the loan has other special or unusual characteristics which warrant special monitoring.\nWhile management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, further reductions in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses on loans. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additional losses based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company's policy is to charge-off loans when, in management's opinion, the loan is deemed uncollectible, although concerted efforts are made to maximize future recoveries. The following table sets forth information regarding changes in the Company's allowance for loan losses for the most recent three years (dollars in thousands):\nTable 92: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>

2021. In general, as loan volume increases, the general reserve levels increase with that growth and as loan volume decreases, the general reserve levels decrease with that decline. The allowance relating to commercial real estate is the largest reserve component. Construction, commercial operating and agricultural operating loans have higher general reserve levels as a percentage than the other loan categories as management perceives more risk in this type of lending. Elements contributing to the higher risk level include a higher percentage of watch, special mention, substandard and impaired loans, and less favorable economic conditions for those portfolios. As of December 31, 2021, commercial real estate loans have general reserves ranging from 1.33% to 1.60%.\nOther factors considered when determining the adequacy of the general reserve include historical losses; watch, substandard and impaired loan volume; the ability to collect past due loans; loan growth; loan-to-value ratios; loan administration; collateral values; and economic factors. The Company's concentration risks include geographic concentration in Iowa; the local economy's dependence upon several large governmental entity employers, including Iowa State University; and the health of Iowa's agricultural sector that, in turn, is dependent on crop and livestock prices, weather conditions, trade policies and government programs. No assurances can be made that losses will remain at the relatively favorable levels experienced over the past five years.\nLoans that the Banks have identified as having higher risk levels are reviewed individually in an effort to establish adequate loss reserves. These reserves are considered specific reserves and are directly impacted by the credit quality of the underlying loans. The specific reserves are dependent upon assumptions regarding the liquidation value of collateral and the cost of recovering collateral including legal fees. Changing the amount of specific reserves on individual loans has historically had a significant impact on the reallocation of the allowance among different parts of the portfolio.

category to total loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity management is the process by which the Company, through its Banks' Asset and Liability Committees (ALCO), ensures adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. These commitments include funding credit obligations to borrowers, funding of mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market, withdrawals by depositors, maintaining adequate collateral for pledging for public funds, trust deposits and borrowings, paying dividends to shareholders, payment of operating expenses, funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements.\nLiquidity is derived primarily from core deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; principal and interest payments, sale, maturity, and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased lines, FHLB advances and other capital market sources.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the level of liquidity and capital resources of the Company remain at a satisfactory level and compare favorably to that of other FDIC insured institutions. Management believes that the Company's liquidity sources will be sufficient to support its existing operations for the foreseeable future.\nThe liquidity and capital resources discussion will cover the following topics:\nTable 97: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Review of the Company's Current Liquidity Sources\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 98: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Review of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 99: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Review of Company Only Cash Flows\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 100: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Review of Commitments for Capital Expenditures, Cash Flow Uncertainties and Known Trends in Liquidity and Cash Flow Needs\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 101: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Capital Resources\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nReview of the Company's Current Liquidity Sources\nLiquid assets of cash on hand, balances due from other banks and interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions for December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $89.1 million and $173.1 million, respectively. The lower balance of liquid assets as of December 31, 2021 primarily relates to decreased deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank as the funds were invested.\nOther sources of liquidity available to the Banks as of December 31, 2021 include available borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $309.4 million and federal funds borrowing capacity at correspondent banks of $107.8 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding FHLB advances of $3.0 million, no federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $39.9 million and no other borrowings. The Company also has a $4 million line of credit with an unaffiliated bank, with no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2021.\nTotal investments as of December 31, 2021, were $831.0 million compared to $597.0 million as of year-end 2020. The investment portfolio provides the Company with a significant amount of liquidity since all investments are classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and have pretax net unrealized gains of $3.8 million and $21.4 million, respectively.\nThe investment portfolio serves an important role in the overall context of balance sheet management in terms of balancing capital utilization and liquidity. The decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment, liquidity, and credit considerations. The portfolio's scheduled maturities represent a significant source of liquidity.\nReview of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $30.5 million and $29.7 million, respectively. The change in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in net income.\nNet cash (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was ($268.6) million and ($184.3) million, respectively. The change in net cash (used in) investing activities in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in purchases of securities and partially offset by a lower increase in loans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $154.1 million and $205.8 million, respectively. The change in net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 was due primarily to a lower increase in deposits.\nReview of Company Only Cash Flows\nThe Company's liquidity on an unconsolidated basis is heavily dependent upon dividends paid to the Company by the Banks. The Company requires adequate liquidity to pay its expenses and pay stockholder dividends. In 2021, dividends from the Banks amounted to $9.7 million compared to $9.6 million in 2020. Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends banking subsidiaries are permitted to pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. Federal Reserve policy further limits the circumstances under which bank holding companies may declare dividends. For example, a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Federal and state banking regulators may also restrict the payment of dividends by order.\nFirst National and United Bank, as national banks, generally may pay dividends, without obtaining the express approval of the OCC, in an amount up to their retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retained net profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consists of net income less dividends declared during the period. Boone Bank, Reliance Bank, State Bank and Iowa State Bank are also restricted under Iowa law to paying dividends only out of their undivided profits. Additionally, the payment of dividends by the Banks is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and the Banks generally are prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the Bank would be undercapitalized.\nThe Company has unconsolidated cash and interest-bearing deposits totaling $2.0 million that is available as of December 31, 2021 to provide additional liquidity to the Banks.\nReview of Commitments for Capital Expenditures, Cash Flow Uncertainties and Known Trends in Liquidity and Cash Flow Needs\nCommitments to extend credit totaled $223.4 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to a total of $222.7 million at the end of 2020. The timing of these credit commitments varies with the underlying borrowers; however, the Company has satisfactory liquidity to fund these obligations as of December 31, 2021. The primary cash flow uncertainty would be a sudden decline in deposits causing the Banks to liquidate securities. Historically, the Banks have maintained an adequate level of short-term marketable investments to fund the temporary declines in deposit balances. There are no other known trends in liquidity and cash flow needs as of December 31, 2021, that are of concern to management.\nOn April 16, 2021, the Company entered into a commitment with a contractor to build a new branch in West Des Moines, Iowa for $1.8 million. There was $1.0 million remaining on the commitment as of December 31, 2021.\nCapital Resources\nThe Company's total stockholders' equity decreased to $207.8 million at December 31, 2021, from $209.5 million at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, stockholders' equity as a percentage of total assets was 9.7% and 10.6%, respectively. The decrease in stockholders' equity was primarily the result of a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, dividends declared, and stock repurchases, offset in part by net income. The capital levels of the Company currently exceed applicable regulatory guidelines to be considered well capitalized\u201d as of December 31, 2021.\nFrom time to time, the Company's board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans. Stock repurchase plans allow the Company to proactively manage its capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. 30,580 shares of common stock were repurchased under stock repurchase plans in 2021 and 100,000 shares of common stock were repurchased in 2020. Also see Part II, Item 5 - Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk refers to the impact that a change in interest rates may have on the Company's earnings and capital. Management's objectives are to control interest rate risk and to ensure predictable and consistent growth of earnings and capital. Interest rate risk management focuses on fluctuations in net interest income identified through computer simulations to evaluate volatility, varying interest rate, spread and volume assumptions. The risk is quantified and compared against tolerance levels.\nThe Company uses a third-party computer software simulation modeling program to measure its exposure to potential interest rate changes. For various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates, numerous other assumptions are made such as prepayment speeds on loans, the slope of the Treasury yield curve, the rates and volumes of the Company's deposits and the rates and volumes of the Company's loans. This analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates.\nAnother measure of interest rate sensitivity is the gap ratio. This ratio indicates the amount of interest-earning assets repricing within a given period in comparison to the amount of interest-bearing liabilities repricing within the same period of time. A gap ratio of 1.0 indicates a matched position, in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements will be minimal. A gap ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that more liabilities than assets reprice within the time period, while a ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that more assets reprice than liabilities.\nThe simulation model process provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity, whereas a static interest rate gap table is compiled as of a point in time. The model simulations differ from a traditional gap analysis, as a traditional gap analysis does not reflect the multiple effects of interest rate movement on the entire range of assets and liabilities and ignores the future impact of new business strategies.\nInflation\nThe primary impact of inflation on the Company's operations is to increase asset yields, deposit costs and operating overhead. Unlike most industries, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than they would on non-financial companies. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. The effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets and, if significant, require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would be otherwise necessary.\nForward-Looking Statements and Business Risks\nCertain statements contained in the foregoing Management's Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Annual Report that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act\u201d), notwithstanding that such statements are not specifically identified. In addition, certain statements may be contained in the Company's future filings with the SEC, in press releases and in oral and written statements made by or with the Company's approval that are not statements of historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Examples of forward-looking statements include but are not limited to: (i) projections of revenues, expenses, income or loss, earnings or loss per share, the payment or nonpayment of dividends, capital structure and other financial items; (ii) statements of plans, objectives and expectations of the Company or its management, including those relating to products or services; (iii) statements of future economic performance; and (iv) statements of assumptions underlying such statements.

In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers (1) the intent to sell the investment securities and the more likely than not requirement that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities prior to recovery (2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in management's assessment of other-than-temporary impairment will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $30.5 million and $29.7 million, respectively.

Unlike most industries, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than they would on non-financial companies. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. The effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets and, if significant, require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would be otherwise necessary.\nTable 66: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.01 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.72 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.83 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.66 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.42 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.83 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62.34 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.51 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.06 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.66 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.05 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nFair Value of Investment Securities\nThe following table sets forth information regarding net charge-offs to average loans outstanding by loan type during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands).\nThe following table sets forth the average balances for each major category of deposit and the weighted average interest rate paid for deposits during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 48: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThe Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio is carried at fair value with fair value\u201d being defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability is not adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact, and (iv) willing to transact.\nLoan Portfolio\nTable 108: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The effects of and changes in trade and monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the changes in assessment rates established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for its Deposit Insurance Fund and interest rate policies of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\n\n\nNet loans as of December 31, 2021 totaled $1.14 billion, an increase of 1.3% from the $1.13 billion as of December 31, 2020.

PPP loans totaled $6.0 million and $50.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Loans are the primary contributor to the Company's revenues and cash flows.

No one municipality or agency represents a concentration within this segment of the investment portfolio. Storm Lake, Iowa, general obligation bonds with a fair value of $7.3 million (approximately 2.5% of the fair value of the government municipalities and subdivisions) represent the largest exposure to any one municipality or subdivision for the Company as of December 31, 2021; the bonds are repayable from the levy of continuing annual tax on all the taxable property within the territory of the city of Storm Lake.\nThe Company reported net income of $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This represents an increase in net income of 26.9% when comparing 2021 with 2020. The improvement in earnings in 2021 from 2020 is primarily the result of a decrease in provision for loan losses due to a significantly higher level of provision in 2020 as a result of uncertainties associated with the economic slow-down created by the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in interest expense due to declines in market interest rates. Earnings per share for 2021 were $2.62 compared to $2.06 in 2020. All six Banks demonstrated profitable operations during 2021 and 2020.\n\nNoninterest expense during the years ended 2021 and 2020 totaled $36.6 million for both periods. Salaries and employee benefits decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number of employees and increased deferred loan costs associated with PPP loan volume, offset in part by normal increases in salaries and other benefits, including health insurance. FDIC insurance assessments, data processing, and business development costs were higher for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The percentage of noninterest expense to average assets was 1.8% in 2021, compared to 2.0% during 2020.\n\nNet interest income during 2021 and 2020 totaled $56.0 million and $54.8 million, respectively, representing a 2.1% increase in 2021 compared to 2020. Net interest income increased in 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to a reduction in interest expense due to declines in market rates on deposits and higher PPP loan interest and related fees, offset in part by a reduction in interest rates on loans. In addition to interest income on PPP loans, fee income of $4.3 million and $2.3 million was recognized into interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company's largest contributing component to net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The volume of and yields earned on earning assets and the volume of and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities determine net interest income. Refer to the tables preceding this paragraph for additional detail. Interest earned and interest paid is also affected by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, by government policies and the action of regulatory authorities. Net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as net interest margin. For the years December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's non-GAAP net interest margin was 2.83% and 3.13%, respectively, computed on an FTE basis. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this report.\nTable 74: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (1) Computed on a tax-equivalent basis using an incremental federal income tax rate of 21 percent for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, adjusted to reflect the effect of the nondeductible interest expense associated with owning tax-exempt securities and loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\n\nThe high level of competition in the local markets will continue to put downward pressure on the net interest margin of the Company. Currently, the Company's primary market in Ames, Iowa, has fourteen banks, six credit unions and several other financial investment companies. Multiple banks are also located in the Company's other market areas in central, north-central and south-central Iowa creating similarly competitive environments.\nCapital Resources\nThe following table sets forth the average amount of and the average rate paid on borrowed funds for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 56: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> If interest rates increase significantly over a relatively short period of time due to higher inflationary numbers or other factors, the interest rate environment may present a challenge to the Company. Increases in interest rates may negatively impact the Company's net interest margin if interest expense increases more quickly than interest income, thus placing downward pressure on net interest income. The Company's earning assets (primarily its loan and investment portfolio) have longer maturities than its interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and other borrowings); therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, interest expense will tend to increase more quickly than interest income as the interest-bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than earning assets, resulting in a reduction in net interest income. In response to this challenge, the Banks model quarterly the changes in income that would result from various changes in interest rates. Based on this modeling, management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks' interest rate risk positions.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\n\n\nThe following table sets forth information concerning the Company's non-performing assets for the past three years ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nThe Company's liquidity on an unconsolidated basis is heavily dependent upon dividends paid to the Company by the Banks. The Company requires adequate liquidity to pay its expenses and pay stockholder dividends. In 2021, dividends from the Banks amounted to $9.7 million compared to $9.6 million in 2020. Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends banking subsidiaries are permitted to pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. Federal Reserve policy further limits the circumstances under which bank holding companies may declare dividends. For example, a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Federal and state banking regulators may also restrict the payment of dividends by order.\nNoninterest income during the years ended 2021 and 2020 totaled $10.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively. The decrease in noninterest income in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to a decrease in gains on sale of residential loans held for sale as refinancing has slowed, fewer security gains, and was partially offset by an increase in wealth management income due to growth in assets under management, fueled by a favorable equity market and new account relationships.\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets. Earning assets consist primarily of loans and investments that earn interest. This ratio is used to measure how well the Company maintains interest rates on earning assets above those of interest-bearing liabilities, which is the interest expense paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings. The Company's net interest margin was lower than the industry average for 2021.\nTable 90: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB advances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.54 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.63 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nNet cash (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was ($268.6) million and ($184.3) million, respectively.

provision (credit) for loan losses reflects management's judgment of the expense to be recognized in order to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company's credit for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was ($757) thousand compared to a provision for loan losses of $5.7 million for the previous year. Net loan recoveries totaled $163 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net loan charge offs of $1.1 million for the previous year. The credit for loan losses in 2021 was primarily due to loan recoveries, a reduction in specific reserves, and improving economic conditions. The provision for loan losses in 2020 was primarily due to uncertainties associated with the economic slow-down created by the COVID-19 pandemic and a specific reserve placed on one hospitality loan in the commercial real estate portfolio. Classified loans, excluding 1-4 family and consumer loans, decreased $14.9 million to $61.4 million in 2021 primarily due to improving credit quality.

within this Annual Report are based on the Company's audited consolidated financial statements which appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained in these statements is, for the most part, based on the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. However, the preparation of these statements requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\n\nTable 113: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Revenues being lower than expected.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThe following table shows the amounts and remaining maturities of time certificates of deposit that had balances in excess of the FDIC insurance limit of $250 thousand as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands).\n\nThe interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk and the amount and maturity terms of the loan. Competitive pressures, market interest rates, the availability of funds and government regulation further influence the rate charged on a loan. The Banks follow a loan policy, which has been approved by both the board of directors of the Company and the Banks and is overseen by both Company and Bank management. These policies establish lending limits, review and grading criteria and other guidelines such as loan administration and allowance for loan losses. Loans are approved by the Banks' board of directors and/or designated officers in accordance with respective guidelines and underwriting policies of the Company. Credit limits generally vary according to the type of loan and the individual loan officer's experience. Loans to any one borrower are limited by applicable state and federal banking laws.\n\nTable 57: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> If market interest rates in the three to five year term remain at low levels as compared to the short term interest rates, the interest rate environment may present a challenge to the Company. The Company's earning assets (typically priced at market interest rates in the three to five year range) will reprice at lower interest rates, but the deposits will not reprice at significantly lower interest rates, therefore the net interest income may decrease. Management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks' interest rate risk positions.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\n\n\nWhile management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, further reductions in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses on loans. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additional losses based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the level of liquidity and capital resources of the Company remain at a satisfactory level and compare favorably to that of other FDIC insured institutions. Management believes that the Company's liquidity sources will be sufficient to support its existing operations for the foreseeable future.\n(1) Yields on tax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis.\nConsumer loans include loans extended to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures not secured by real estate. Most of the Banks' consumer lending is for vehicles, consolidation of personal debts and home improvements.\nTable 83: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Boone Bank, Reliance Bank, State Bank and Iowa State Bank are also restricted under Iowa law to paying dividends only out of their undivided profits. Additionally, the payment of dividends by the Banks is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and the Banks generally are prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the Bank would be undercapitalized.\nThere was no mortgage origination funding awaiting delivery to the secondary market as of December 31, 2021 and $1.6 million as of December 31, 2020. Residential mortgage loans are originated by the Banks and sold to several secondary mortgage market outlets based upon customer product preferences and pricing considerations. The mortgages are sold in the secondary market to eliminate interest rate risk and to generate secondary market fee income.

The first table includes the Company's average assets and the related income to determine the average yield on earning assets. The second table includes the average liabilities and related expense to determine the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.

These procedures, as applicable, are utilized for all municipal purchases and are utilized in whole or in part for monitoring the portfolio of municipal holdings. The Company does not utilize third party credit rating agencies as a primary component of determining if the municipal issuer has an adequate capacity to meet the financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the investment, and, therefore, does not compare internal assessments to those of the credit rating agencies. Credit rating downgrades are utilized as an additional indicator of credit weakness and as a reference point for historical default rates.\nTable 58: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The agricultural community is subject to commodity price fluctuations. Extended periods of low commodity prices, higher input costs or poor weather conditions could result in reduced profit margins, reducing demand for goods and services provided by agriculture-related businesses, which, in turn, could affect other businesses in the Company's market area. Moreover, changes in U.S. trade policy could create further volatility for commodities prices as the volume of exports of agricultural products to these foreign markets could be adversely impacted. Lastly, uncertainty regarding governmental mandates affecting ethanol production could reduce the demand for corn in the Company's trade area, thus introducing further price volatility for this commodity. Any combination of these factors could produce losses within the Company's agricultural loan portfolio and in the commercial loan portfolio with respect to borrowers whose businesses are directly or indirectly impacted by the health of the agricultural economy. Such losses could result in an accelerated level of charge-offs and the need to increase provision expenses, thus resulting in reduced earnings.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\n\nAverage Balances and Interest Rates (continued)\nRate and Volume Analysis\nAsset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\nTable 104: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Local, regional and national economic conditions and the impact they may have on the Company and its customers, and management's assessment of that impact on its estimates including, but not limited to, the allowance for loan losses and fair value of other real estate owned.

For various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates, numerous other assumptions are made such as prepayment speeds on loans, the slope of the Treasury yield curve, the rates and volumes of the Company's deposits and the rates and volumes of the Company's loans. This analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates.\nTable 101: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Capital Resources\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nAverage Balances and Interest Rates\n\nBalance Sheet Review\nTable 49: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Income Statement Review\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\n\nThe Company's loan portfolio consists of real estate, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans. As of December 31, 2021, gross loans totaled approximately $1.16 billion, which equals approximately 61.8% of total deposits and 54.3% of total assets. The Iowa State Average Report (consisting of 256 banks in the State of Iowa) loan to deposit ratio as of December 31, 2021 was 67%. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of the loans were originated directly by the Banks to borrowers within the Banks' principal market areas. There are no foreign loans outstanding during the years presented.\nTable 43: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> * Dividends are typically declared in one quarter and then paid in the subsequent quarter.

The average balances of impaired loans for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $13.2 million and $14.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest income, which would have been recorded under the original terms of nonaccrual loans, was approximately $650 thousand and $975 thousand, respectively. There was $169 thousand and $39 thousand of loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing interest as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nTable 61: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> We may experience a potential slowdown in demand for our products and services, including the demand for traditional loans, although we believe the decline may be offset, in whole or in part, due to inflation and higher interest rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\n\nThe Company's primary source of funds is customer deposits. The Banks attempt to attract noninterest-bearing deposits, which are a low-cost funding source. In addition, the Banks offer a variety of interest-bearing accounts designed to attract both short-term and longer-term deposits from customers. Interest-bearing accounts earn interest at rates established by Bank management based on competitive market factors and the Company's need for funds. While 66.0% of the Banks' certificates of deposit mature in the next year, it is anticipated that many of these certificates will be renewed. Rate sensitive certificates of deposits in excess of $250,000 are subject to somewhat higher volatility with regard to renewal volume as the Banks adjust rates based upon funding needs. In the event a substantial volume of certificates is not renewed, the Company has sufficient liquid assets and borrowing lines to fund significant runoff. A sustained reduction in deposit volume would have a significant negative impact on the Company's operations and liquidity. The Company had $7.0 million and $8.7 million of brokered deposits as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company has approximately $386.1 million of uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2021.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses that is treated as an expense and charged against earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collectability of the principal is unlikely. The Company has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan portfolio, including timely identification of potential problem loans. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses, incorporating a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss experience, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, known information about individual loans and other factors. Qualitative factors include various considerations regarding the general economic environment in the Company's market area. To the extent actual results differ from forecasts and management's judgment, the allowance for loan losses may be greater or lesser than future charge-offs. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $154.1 million and $205.8 million, respectively. The change in net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 was due primarily to a lower increase in deposits.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2021 and 2020 was $6.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively. This amount represents an effective tax rate of 22.0% and 18.9%, respectively. The Company's federal income tax rate was 21% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate compared to 2020 was due to a $396 thousand deferred tax valuation allowance established in 2021 on a state tax net operating loss at the holding company. The effective tax rate in both years were also impacted by tax exempt interest income and New Markets Tax Credits.\nTable 51: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nDeposit Maturity\n\nCommitments to extend credit totaled $223.4 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to a total of $222.7 million at the end of 2020. The timing of these credit commitments varies with the underlying borrowers; however, the Company has satisfactory liquidity to fund these obligations as of December 31, 2021. The primary cash flow uncertainty would be a sudden decline in deposits causing the Banks to liquidate securities. Historically, the Banks have maintained an adequate level of short-term marketable investments to fund the temporary declines in deposit balances. There are no other known trends in liquidity and cash flow needs as of December 31, 2021, that are of concern to management.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLoans that the Banks have identified as having higher risk levels are reviewed individually in an effort to establish adequate loss reserves. These reserves are considered specific reserves and are directly impacted by the credit quality of the underlying loans. The specific reserves are dependent upon assumptions regarding the liquidation value of collateral and the cost of recovering collateral including legal fees. Changing the amount of specific reserves on individual loans has historically had a significant impact on the reallocation of the allowance among different parts of the portfolio. The following table sets forth information regarding changes in the Company's specific reserve on loans individually evaluated for impairment and loans individually evaluated for impairment for the most recent three years (dollars in thousands):\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d accompanying the Company's audited financial statements. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments, management has identified the allowance for loan losses, the fair value determination of investment securities and the assessment of goodwill to be the Company's most critical accounting policies.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOther factors considered when determining the adequacy of the general reserve include historical losses; watch, substandard and impaired loan volume; the ability to collect past due loans; loan growth; loan-to-value ratios; loan administration; collateral values; and economic factors. The Company's concentration risks include geographic concentration in Iowa; the local economy's dependence upon several large governmental entity employers, including Iowa State University; and the health of Iowa's agricultural sector that, in turn, is dependent on crop and livestock prices, weather conditions, trade policies and government programs. No assurances can be made that losses will remain at the relatively favorable levels experienced over the past five years.\nThe Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit that assist customers with their credit needs to conduct business. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, the most likely impact of these financial instruments on revenues, expenses, or cash flows of the Company would come from unidentified credit risk causing higher provision expense for loan losses in future periods. These financial instruments are not expected to have a significant impact on the liquidity or capital resources of the Company. For additional information, including quantification of the amounts involved, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Statements\u201d and the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of this discussion.\nNoninterest Income and Expense\n\nThe adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated quarterly by management, the Company and respective Bank boards. This evaluation focuses on specific loan reviews, changes in the type and volume of the loan portfolio given the current economic conditions and historical loss experience. Any one of the following conditions may result in the review of a specific loan: concern about whether the customer's cash flow or collateral are sufficient to repay the loan; delinquent status; criticism of the loan in a regulatory examination; the accrual of interest has been suspended; or other reasons, including when the loan has other special or unusual characteristics which warrant special monitoring.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company's credit risk is centered in the loan portfolio, which on December 31, 2021, totaled $1.14 billion as compared to $1.13 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 1.3%. Net loans comprise approximately 54% of total assets as of the end of 2021. The objective in managing loan portfolio risk is to reduce the risk of loss resulting from a customer's failure to perform according to the terms of a transaction and to quantify and manage credit risk on a portfolio basis. As the following chart indicates, the Company's non-performing assets have decreased by 16% from December 31, 2020 and total $13.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The Company's level of non-performing loans as a percentage of loans of 1.11% as of December 31, 2021, is higher than the Iowa State Average peer group of FDIC insured institutions as of December 31, 2021, of 0.45%. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2021 remains adequate based on its analysis of the non-performing assets and the portfolio as a whole.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n\nThe principal sources of Company revenues and cash flows are: (i) interest and fees earned on loans made or held by the Company and Banks; (ii) interest on investments, primarily on bonds, held by the Banks; (iii) fees on wealth management services; (iv) service charges on deposit accounts maintained at the Banks; (v) merchant and card fees; (vi) gain on the sale of loans held for sale; and (vii) securities gains. The Company's principal expenses are: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) salaries and employee benefits; (iii) data processing costs primarily associated with maintaining the Banks' loan and deposit functions; (iv) occupancy expenses for maintaining the Banks' facilities; (v) professional fees; and (vi) business development. The largest component contributing to the Company's net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets (primarily loans and investments) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposit accounts and other borrowings). One of management's principal functions is to manage the spread between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities in an effort to maximize net interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of interest rate risk.\n\nCertain of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are discussed in greater detail under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A herein.\n\nNon-performing Assets\nThese factors may not constitute all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statement. The Company operates in a continually changing business environment and new facts emerge from time to time. The Company cannot predict such factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such factors on its financial condition or its results of operations. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a predictor of actual results. The Company disclaims any responsibility to update any forward-looking statement provided in this document.\nLiquidity management is the process by which the Company, through its Banks' Asset and Liability Committees (ALCO), ensures adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. These commitments include funding credit obligations to borrowers, funding of mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market, withdrawals by depositors, maintaining adequate collateral for pledging for public funds, trust deposits and borrowings, paying dividends to shareholders, payment of operating expenses, funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAgricultural loans play an important part in the Banks' loan portfolios. Iowa is a major agricultural state and is a national leader in both grain and livestock production. The Banks play a significant role in their communities in financing operating, livestock and real estate activities for area producers.\n\nGoodwill arose in connection with four acquisitions consummated in previous periods. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if conditions indicate a possible impairment. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, determination of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Impairment would arise if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The Company completed a quantitative assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2021 which indicated that goodwill was not impaired. Subsequently, the Company determined there were no adverse changes in criteria and key considerations to the previous assessment. Accordingly, the Company concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2021. Goodwill may be impaired in the future if actual future test results differ from the present evaluation of impairment due to changes in the conditions used in the current evaluation. The effects of the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our net income, fair value and correspondingly goodwill. An impairment of goodwill would decrease the Company's earnings during the period in which the impairment is recorded.\n\nThe liquidity and capital resources discussion will cover the following topics:\n\n\nLoans Held For Sale\nGeneral reserves for loan categories range from 1.09% to 1.94% of the outstanding loan balances as of December 31, 2021. In general, as loan volume increases, the general reserve levels increase with that growth and as loan volume decreases, the general reserve levels decrease with that decline. The allowance relating to commercial real estate is the largest reserve component. Construction, commercial operating and agricultural operating loans have higher general reserve levels as a percentage than the other loan categories as management perceives more risk in this type of lending. Elements contributing to the higher risk level include a higher percentage of watch, special mention, substandard and impaired loans, and less favorable economic conditions for those portfolios. As of December 31, 2021, commercial real estate loans have general reserves ranging from 1.33% to 1.60%.\nThe provision for loan losses represents an expense charged against earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include: an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower; a realistic determination of value and adequacy of underlying collateral; historical charge-offs; the condition of the local economy; the condition of the specific industry of the borrower; an analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories; and a review of delinquent and classified loans.\n\nThe accrual of interest on nonaccrual and other impaired loans is generally discontinued at 90 days or when, in the opinion of management, the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received and when principal obligations are expected to be recoverable. Interest income on restructured loans is recognized pursuant to the terms of the new loan agreement. Interest income on other impaired loans remaining on accrual is monitored and income is recognized based upon the terms of the underlying loan agreement. However, the recorded net investment in impaired loans, including accrued interest, is limited to the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or the observable fair value of the loan's collateral.\nThe following table sets forth, on a tax-equivalent basis, a summary of the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates (in thousands).\nProvision (Credit) for Loan Losses\nAnother measure of interest rate sensitivity is the gap ratio. This ratio indicates the amount of interest-earning assets repricing within a given period in comparison to the amount of interest-bearing liabilities repricing within the same period of time. A gap ratio of 1.0 indicates a matched position, in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements will be minimal. A gap ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that more liabilities than assets reprice within the time period, while a ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that more assets reprice than liabilities.\nTotal investments as of December 31, 2021, were $831.0 million compared to $597.0 million as of year-end 2020. The investment portfolio provides the Company with a significant amount of liquidity since all investments are classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and have pretax net unrealized gains of $3.8 million and $21.4 million, respectively.\nSummary of the Allowance for Loan Losses\n\nOther sources of liquidity available to the Banks as of December 31, 2021 include available borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $309.4 million and federal funds borrowing capacity at correspondent banks of $107.8 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding FHLB advances of $3.0 million, no federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $39.9 million and no other borrowings. The Company also has a $4 million line of credit with an unaffiliated bank, with no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2021.\n\nFor further discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses and the process of establishing specific reserves, see the section of this Annual Report entitled Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\u201d and Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nThe following discussion is provided for the consolidated operations of the Company and its Banks. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant factors affecting the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nTotal assets increased to $2.14 billion in 2021 compared to $1.98 billion in 2020, or 8.2%. The increase was primarily due to investment securities which was funded by growth in our deposits due in part to federal government stimulus programs and a lack of other desirable fixed income alternatives for our customers.\nInvestment Maturities as of December 31, 2021\n\n\nManagement believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the current portfolio. This statement is based upon management's continuing evaluation of inherent risks in the current loan portfolio, current levels of classified assets and general economic factors. The Company will continue to monitor the allowance and make future adjustments to the allowance as conditions dictate. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nForward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such statement. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have magnified these risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:\nCertain key performance indicators for the Company and the industry are presented in the following chart. The industry figures are compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and are derived from 4,391 community banks and savings institutions insured by the FDIC. Management reviews these indicators on a quarterly basis for purposes of comparing the Company's performance from quarter to quarter against the industry as a whole.\n", "item_7_text": "Review of the Company's Current Liquidity Sources\nForward-Looking Statements and Business Risks\n\nInterest Rate Risk\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\n\nDeclines in the fair value of available-for-sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers (1) the intent to sell the investment securities and the more likely than not requirement that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities prior to recovery (2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in management's assessment of other-than-temporary impairment will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $30.5 million and $29.7 million, respectively. The change in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in net income.\n\nThe investments in the following table are reported by contractual maturity. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers of the securities may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties (in thousands).\nThe primary impact of inflation on the Company's operations is to increase asset yields, deposit costs and operating overhead. Unlike most industries, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than they would on non-financial companies. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. The effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets and, if significant, require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would be otherwise necessary.\nFair Value of Investment Securities\nThe following table sets forth information regarding net charge-offs to average loans outstanding by loan type during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands).\nThe following table sets forth the average balances for each major category of deposit and the weighted average interest rate paid for deposits during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands).\nThe Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio is carried at fair value with fair value\u201d being defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability is not adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact, and (iv) willing to transact.\nLoan Portfolio\n\n\nNet loans as of December 31, 2021 totaled $1.14 billion, an increase of 1.3% from the $1.13 billion as of December 31, 2020. Loans increased primarily due to increases in the 1-4 family and commercial real estate loan portfolios, offset in part by a reduction due to forgiveness of PPP loans. PPP loans totaled $6.0 million and $50.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Loans are the primary contributor to the Company's revenues and cash flows. The average yield on loans was 241 and 202 basis points higher in 2021 and 2020, respectively, in comparison to the average tax-equivalent investment portfolio yields.\n\nInterest rate risk refers to the impact that a change in interest rates may have on the Company's earnings and capital. Management's objectives are to control interest rate risk and to ensure predictable and consistent growth of earnings and capital. Interest rate risk management focuses on fluctuations in net interest income identified through computer simulations to evaluate volatility, varying interest rate, spread and volume assumptions. The risk is quantified and compared against tolerance levels.\n\n\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average assets. It is used to measure how effectively the assets of the Company are being utilized in generating income. The Company's return on assets ratio was slightly lower the industry average for 2021.\nNon-performing loans totaled $12.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and were $2.5 million lower than the non-performing loans as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in non-performing loans was due primarily to payoffs and paydowns of loans on nonaccrual. The Company considers non-performing loans to generally include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing and other loans that may or may not meet the former nonperforming criteria but are considered to meet the definition of impaired.\nThe Company does not engage in any material business activities apart from its ownership of the Banks. Products and services offered by the Banks are for commercial and consumer purposes, including loans, deposits and wealth management services. Some Banks also offer investment services through a third-party broker-dealer. The Company employs 17 individuals to assist with financial reporting, human resources, marketing, audit, compliance, technology systems, property appraisals, training and the coordination of management activities, in addition to 254 full-time equivalent individuals employed by the Banks.\n\nReal estate loans include various types of loans for which the Banks hold real property as collateral and consist of loans primarily on commercial, agricultural, and multifamily properties and single-family residences. Real estate loans typically have fixed rates for up to five years, with the Company's loan policy permitting a maximum fixed rate maturity of up to 15 years. The majority of construction loan volume is given to contractors to construct 1-4 family residence and commercial buildings. The Banks also originate residential real estate loans for sale to the secondary market for a fee.\nThe investment portfolio serves an important role in the overall context of balance sheet management in terms of balancing capital utilization and liquidity. The decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment, liquidity, and credit considerations. The portfolio's scheduled maturities represent a significant source of liquidity.\nThe capital ratio is calculated by dividing average total equity capital by average total assets. It measures the level of average assets that are funded by shareholders' equity. Given an equal level of risk in the financial condition of two companies, the higher the capital ratio, generally the more financially sound the company. The Company's capital ratio was similar to the industry average for 2021.\nManagement's process for obtaining and validating the fair value of investment securities is discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d which is included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe following table summarizes the outstanding amount of, and the average rate on, borrowed funds as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands).\nThe following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last two years.\nThe onset and continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the level of challenges, risks and uncertainties facing our business and continuation of operations, including the following:\n\n\n\n\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates as of December 31, 2021\n\n\nInflation\nCommercial loans consist primarily of loans to businesses for various purposes, including revolving lines to finance current operations, floor-plans, inventory and accounts receivable; capital expenditure loans to finance equipment and other fixed assets; and letters of credit. These loans generally have short maturities, have either adjustable or fixed rates and are unsecured or secured by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and/or real estate.\nReview of Commitments for Capital Expenditures, Cash Flow Uncertainties and Known Trends in Liquidity and Cash Flow Needs\nTotal investments as of December 31, 2021 were $831.0 million, an increase of $234.0 million or 39.2% from the prior year end. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the investment portfolio comprised 39% and 30% of total assets, respectively. The increase in investments is primarily due to purchases in excess of maturities of U.S. treasuries and municipal bonds as deposit growth was deployed.\n\nThe rate and volume analysis is used to determine how much of the change in interest income or expense is the result of a change in volume or a change in interest rate. For example, real estate loan interest income decreased $1.7 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Increased volume of real estate loans increased interest income in 2021 by $1.7 million and lower interest rates decreased interest income in 2021 by $3.4 million.\n\nBorrowed Funds\nNet Interest Income\nAverage Deposits by Type\n\n\n\nOn April 16, 2021, the Company entered into a commitment with a contractor to build a new branch in West Des Moines, Iowa for $1.8 million. There was $1.0 million remaining on the commitment as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Company's return on average equity for 2021 was 11.43% compared to 9.48% in 2020. The return on average assets for 2021 was 1.15% compared to 1.01% in 2020. The increase in return on average equity and return on average assets when comparing 2021 to 2020 was primarily a result of improved earnings.\n\nNoninterest expense for the Company consists of all operating expenses other than interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds. Salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of the Company's operating expenses and comprise 61% and 63% of noninterest expense in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nCertain statements contained in the foregoing Management's Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Annual Report that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act\u201d), notwithstanding that such statements are not specifically identified. In addition, certain statements may be contained in the Company's future filings with the SEC, in press releases and in oral and written statements made by or with the Company's approval that are not statements of historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Examples of forward-looking statements include but are not limited to: (i) projections of revenues, expenses, income or loss, earnings or loss per share, the payment or nonpayment of dividends, capital structure and other financial items; (ii) statements of plans, objectives and expectations of the Company or its management, including those relating to products or services; (iii) statements of future economic performance; and (iv) statements of assumptions underlying such statements. Words such as believes\u201d, anticipates\u201d, expects\u201d, intends\u201d, targeted\u201d, projected\u201d, continue\u201d, remain\u201d, will\u201d, should\u201d, may\u201d and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.\n\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average equity. It is used to measure the net income or return the Company generated for the shareholders' equity investment in the Company. The Company's return on equity ratio was similar to the industry average for 2021.\nThe following financial data of the Company for the three years ended December 31, 2019 through 2021 is derived from the Company's historical audited financial statements and related footnotes. The information set forth below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's investment securities portfolio included securities issued by 298 and 279 government municipalities and agencies located within 28 and 24 states with a fair value of $292.9 million and $251.6 million, respectively. No one municipality or agency represents a concentration within this segment of the investment portfolio. Storm Lake, Iowa, general obligation bonds with a fair value of $7.3 million (approximately 2.5% of the fair value of the government municipalities and subdivisions) represent the largest exposure to any one municipality or subdivision for the Company as of December 31, 2021; the bonds are repayable from the levy of continuing annual tax on all the taxable property within the territory of the city of Storm Lake.\nThe Company reported net income of $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This represents an increase in net income of 26.9% when comparing 2021 with 2020. The improvement in earnings in 2021 from 2020 is primarily the result of a decrease in provision for loan losses due to a significantly higher level of provision in 2020 as a result of uncertainties associated with the economic slow-down created by the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in interest expense due to declines in market interest rates. Earnings per share for 2021 were $2.62 compared to $2.06 in 2020. All six Banks demonstrated profitable operations during 2021 and 2020.\n\nNoninterest expense during the years ended 2021 and 2020 totaled $36.6 million for both periods. Salaries and employee benefits decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number of employees and increased deferred loan costs associated with PPP loan volume, offset in part by normal increases in salaries and other benefits, including health insurance. FDIC insurance assessments, data processing, and business development costs were higher for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The percentage of noninterest expense to average assets was 1.8% in 2021, compared to 2.0% during 2020.\n\nNet interest income during 2021 and 2020 totaled $56.0 million and $54.8 million, respectively, representing a 2.1% increase in 2021 compared to 2020. Net interest income increased in 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to a reduction in interest expense due to declines in market rates on deposits and higher PPP loan interest and related fees, offset in part by a reduction in interest rates on loans. In addition to interest income on PPP loans, fee income of $4.3 million and $2.3 million was recognized into interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company's largest contributing component to net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The volume of and yields earned on earning assets and the volume of and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities determine net interest income. Refer to the tables preceding this paragraph for additional detail. Interest earned and interest paid is also affected by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, by government policies and the action of regulatory authorities. Net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as net interest margin. For the years December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's non-GAAP net interest margin was 2.83% and 3.13%, respectively, computed on an FTE basis. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this report.\n\nThe high level of competition in the local markets will continue to put downward pressure on the net interest margin of the Company. Currently, the Company's primary market in Ames, Iowa, has fourteen banks, six credit unions and several other financial investment companies. Multiple banks are also located in the Company's other market areas in central, north-central and south-central Iowa creating similarly competitive environments.\nCapital Resources\nThe following table sets forth the average amount of and the average rate paid on borrowed funds for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands).\n\n\nThe following table sets forth information concerning the Company's non-performing assets for the past three years ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nThe Company's liquidity on an unconsolidated basis is heavily dependent upon dividends paid to the Company by the Banks. The Company requires adequate liquidity to pay its expenses and pay stockholder dividends. In 2021, dividends from the Banks amounted to $9.7 million compared to $9.6 million in 2020. Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends banking subsidiaries are permitted to pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. Federal Reserve policy further limits the circumstances under which bank holding companies may declare dividends. For example, a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Federal and state banking regulators may also restrict the payment of dividends by order.\nNoninterest income during the years ended 2021 and 2020 totaled $10.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively. The decrease in noninterest income in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to a decrease in gains on sale of residential loans held for sale as refinancing has slowed, fewer security gains, and was partially offset by an increase in wealth management income due to growth in assets under management, fueled by a favorable equity market and new account relationships.\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets. Earning assets consist primarily of loans and investments that earn interest. This ratio is used to measure how well the Company maintains interest rates on earning assets above those of interest-bearing liabilities, which is the interest expense paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings. The Company's net interest margin was lower than the industry average for 2021.\nNet cash (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was ($268.6) million and ($184.3) million, respectively. The change in net cash (used in) investing activities in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in purchases of securities and partially offset by a lower increase in loans.\nChallenges and COVID-19 Status, Risks and Uncertainties\n\n\nDeposits\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the revenue bonds in the Company's investment securities portfolios were issued by government municipalities and agencies to fund public services such as community school facilities, college and university dormitory facilities and water utilities. The revenue bonds are to be paid from 16 and 14 revenue sources in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The revenue sources that represent 5% or more, individually, as a percent of the total revenue bonds are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nReview of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nReview of Company Only Cash Flows\nThe provision (credit) for loan losses reflects management's judgment of the expense to be recognized in order to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company's credit for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was ($757) thousand compared to a provision for loan losses of $5.7 million for the previous year. Net loan recoveries totaled $163 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net loan charge offs of $1.1 million for the previous year. The credit for loan losses in 2021 was primarily due to loan recoveries, a reduction in specific reserves, and improving economic conditions. The provision for loan losses in 2020 was primarily due to uncertainties associated with the economic slow-down created by the COVID-19 pandemic and a specific reserve placed on one hospitality loan in the commercial real estate portfolio. Classified loans, excluding 1-4 family and consumer loans, decreased $14.9 million to $61.4 million in 2021 primarily due to improving credit quality. Refer to the Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\u201d discussion for additional details with regard to loan loss provision expense.\nSelected Indicators for the Company and the Industry\nThe following table shows the amounts and remaining maturities of estimated uninsured time certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands).\n\n\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\n\nAverage Annual Borrowed Funds\nThe discussion contained in this Item 7 and other disclosures included within this Annual Report are based on the Company's audited consolidated financial statements which appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained in these statements is, for the most part, based on the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. However, the preparation of these statements requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\n\nThe following table shows the amounts and remaining maturities of time certificates of deposit that had balances in excess of the FDIC insurance limit of $250 thousand as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands).\n\nThe interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk and the amount and maturity terms of the loan. Competitive pressures, market interest rates, the availability of funds and government regulation further influence the rate charged on a loan. The Banks follow a loan policy, which has been approved by both the board of directors of the Company and the Banks and is overseen by both Company and Bank management. These policies establish lending limits, review and grading criteria and other guidelines such as loan administration and allowance for loan losses. Loans are approved by the Banks' board of directors and/or designated officers in accordance with respective guidelines and underwriting policies of the Company. Credit limits generally vary according to the type of loan and the individual loan officer's experience. Loans to any one borrower are limited by applicable state and federal banking laws.\n\n\n\nWhile management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, further reductions in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses on loans. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additional losses based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the level of liquidity and capital resources of the Company remain at a satisfactory level and compare favorably to that of other FDIC insured institutions. Management believes that the Company's liquidity sources will be sufficient to support its existing operations for the foreseeable future.\n(1) Yields on tax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis.\nConsumer loans include loans extended to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures not secured by real estate. Most of the Banks' consumer lending is for vehicles, consolidation of personal debts and home improvements.\n\nFirst National and United Bank, as national banks, generally may pay dividends, without obtaining the express approval of the OCC, in an amount up to their retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retained net profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consists of net income less dividends declared during the period. Boone Bank, Reliance Bank, State Bank and Iowa State Bank are also restricted under Iowa law to paying dividends only out of their undivided profits. Additionally, the payment of dividends by the Banks is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and the Banks generally are prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the Bank would be undercapitalized.\nThere was no mortgage origination funding awaiting delivery to the secondary market as of December 31, 2021 and $1.6 million as of December 31, 2020. Residential mortgage loans are originated by the Banks and sold to several secondary mortgage market outlets based upon customer product preferences and pricing considerations. The mortgages are sold in the secondary market to eliminate interest rate risk and to generate secondary market fee income. It is not anticipated at the present time that loans held for sale will become a significant portion of total assets.\n\n\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. The ratio is a measure of the Company's ability to manage noninterest expenses. The Company's efficiency ratio was lower than the industry average for 2021.\nThe following two tables are used to calculate the Company's non-GAAP net interest margin on an FTE basis. The first table includes the Company's average assets and the related income to determine the average yield on earning assets. The second table includes the average liabilities and related expense to determine the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin is equal to the interest income less the interest expense divided by average earning assets. Refer to the net interest income discussion following the tables for additional detail. (dollars in thousands)\nThe following table shows the contractual maturities after one year of the Company's loan portfolio by fixed- and variable-rate loans as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\nThe contractual maturities of the Company's loan portfolio are as shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because individual borrowers may have the right to prepay loans with or without prepayment penalties (in thousands).\n\n\nLiquid assets of cash on hand, balances due from other banks and interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions for December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $89.1 million and $173.1 million, respectively. The lower balance of liquid assets as of December 31, 2021 primarily relates to decreased deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank as the funds were invested.\n\nTypes of Loans\n\nThe Company's primary competitive strategy is to utilize seasoned and competent Bank management and local decision-making authority to provide customers with prompt response times and flexibility in the products and services offered. This strategy is viewed as providing an opportunity to increase revenues through the creation of a competitive advantage over other financial institutions. The Company also strives to remain operationally efficient to improve profitability while enabling the Banks to offer more competitive loan and deposit rates.\nIncome Statement Review\nThe Company's policy is to charge-off loans when, in management's opinion, the loan is deemed uncollectible, although concerted efforts are made to maximize future recoveries. The following table sets forth information regarding changes in the Company's allowance for loan losses for the most recent three years (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes the total general obligation and revenue bonds in the Company's investment securities portfolios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 identifying the state in which the issuing government municipality or agency operates (in thousands):\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nThis Annual Report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures include the Company's presentation of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used in the financial institutions industry and provide useful information to both management and investors to analyze and evaluate the Company's financial performance. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be considered an alternative to the Company's GAAP results. The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income and net interest margin on an FTE basis to GAAP (dollars in thousands).\n\nThe Company's total stockholders' equity decreased to $207.8 million at December 31, 2021, from $209.5 million at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, stockholders' equity as a percentage of total assets was 9.7% and 10.6%, respectively. The decrease in stockholders' equity was primarily the result of a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, dividends declared, and stock repurchases, offset in part by net income. The capital levels of the Company currently exceed applicable regulatory guidelines to be considered well capitalized\u201d as of December 31, 2021.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning the Company's allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the most recent three years (dollars in thousands):\nInvestment Portfolio\nThe following discussion will provide a summary review of important items relating to:\n\nManagement has identified certain events or circumstances that have the potential to negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations in the future and is attempting to position the Company to best respond to those challenges.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\n\nTotal deposits were $1.88 billion and $1.72 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $161.6 million between the periods can be primarily attributed to federal government stimulus programs and increases in core deposits, including retail and commercial funds. Balances fluctuate as customer liquidity needs vary and could be impacted by distressed economic conditions or additional government stimulus.\nThe Company's procedures for evaluating investments in states, municipalities and political subdivisions include but are not limited to reviewing the offering statement and the most current available financial information, comparing yields to yields of bonds of similar credit quality, confirming capacity to repay, assessing operating and financial performance, evaluating the stability of tax revenues, considering debt profiles and local demographics, and for revenue bonds, assessing the source and strength of revenue structures for municipal authorities. These procedures, as applicable, are utilized for all municipal purchases and are utilized in whole or in part for monitoring the portfolio of municipal holdings. The Company does not utilize third party credit rating agencies as a primary component of determining if the municipal issuer has an adequate capacity to meet the financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the investment, and, therefore, does not compare internal assessments to those of the credit rating agencies. Credit rating downgrades are utilized as an additional indicator of credit weakness and as a reference point for historical default rates.\n\nAverage Balances and Interest Rates (continued)\nRate and Volume Analysis\nAsset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\nBorrowed funds that may be utilized by the Company are comprised of FHLB advances, federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements). Borrowed funds are an alternative funding source to deposits and can be used to fund the Company's assets and unforeseen liquidity needs. FHLB advances are loans from the FHLB that can mature daily or have longer maturities for fixed or floating rates of interest. Federal funds purchased are borrowings from other banks that mature daily. Repurchase agreements are similar to deposits as they are funds lent by various Bank customers; however, investment securities are pledged to secure such borrowings. The Company's repurchase agreements reprice daily.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nKey performance indicators include:\n\n\nThe simulation model process provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity, whereas a static interest rate gap table is compiled as of a point in time. The model simulations differ from a traditional gap analysis, as a traditional gap analysis does not reflect the multiple effects of interest rate movement on the entire range of assets and liabilities and ignores the future impact of new business strategies.\nFrom time to time, the Company's board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans. Stock repurchase plans allow the Company to proactively manage its capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. 30,580 shares of common stock were repurchased under stock repurchase plans in 2021 and 100,000 shares of common stock were repurchased in 2020. Also see Part II, Item 5 - Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe Company's assets are comprised primarily of loans and investment securities. The majority of average earning asset maturity or repricing dates are generally five years or less for the combined portfolios as the assets are funded for the most part by short term deposits with either immediate availability or less than one-year average maturities. This exposes the Company to risk regarding changes in interest rates.\n\n\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\n\nTotal noninterest income is comprised primarily of fee-based revenues from wealth management and trust services, bank-related service charges on deposit activities, net securities gains, merchant and card fees related to electronic processing of merchant and cash transactions and gain on the sale of loans held for sale.\nGoodwill\nThe Company has unconsolidated cash and interest-bearing deposits totaling $2.0 million that is available as of December 31, 2021 to provide additional liquidity to the Banks.\n\nOverview\nThe Company uses a third-party computer software simulation modeling program to measure its exposure to potential interest rate changes. For various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates, numerous other assumptions are made such as prepayment speeds on loans, the slope of the Treasury yield curve, the rates and volumes of the Company's deposits and the rates and volumes of the Company's loans. This analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates.\nAverage Balances and Interest Rates\n\nBalance Sheet Review\n\nThe Company's loan portfolio consists of real estate, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans. As of December 31, 2021, gross loans totaled approximately $1.16 billion, which equals approximately 61.8% of total deposits and 54.3% of total assets. The Iowa State Average Report (consisting of 256 banks in the State of Iowa) loan to deposit ratio as of December 31, 2021 was 67%. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of the loans were originated directly by the Banks to borrowers within the Banks' principal market areas. There are no foreign loans outstanding during the years presented.\nLiquidity is derived primarily from core deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; principal and interest payments, sale, maturity, and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased lines, FHLB advances and other capital market sources.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses related to these impaired loans was approximately $1.4 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The average balances of impaired loans for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $13.2 million and $14.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest income, which would have been recorded under the original terms of nonaccrual loans, was approximately $650 thousand and $975 thousand, respectively. There was $169 thousand and $39 thousand of loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing interest as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\nThe Company's primary source of funds is customer deposits. The Banks attempt to attract noninterest-bearing deposits, which are a low-cost funding source. In addition, the Banks offer a variety of interest-bearing accounts designed to attract both short-term and longer-term deposits from customers. Interest-bearing accounts earn interest at rates established by Bank management based on competitive market factors and the Company's need for funds. While 66.0% of the Banks' certificates of deposit mature in the next year, it is anticipated that many of these certificates will be renewed. Rate sensitive certificates of deposits in excess of $250,000 are subject to somewhat higher volatility with regard to renewal volume as the Banks adjust rates based upon funding needs. In the event a substantial volume of certificates is not renewed, the Company has sufficient liquid assets and borrowing lines to fund significant runoff. A sustained reduction in deposit volume would have a significant negative impact on the Company's operations and liquidity. The Company had $7.0 million and $8.7 million of brokered deposits as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company has approximately $386.1 million of uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2021.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses that is treated as an expense and charged against earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collectability of the principal is unlikely. The Company has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan portfolio, including timely identification of potential problem loans. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses, incorporating a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss experience, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, known information about individual loans and other factors. Qualitative factors include various considerations regarding the general economic environment in the Company's market area. To the extent actual results differ from forecasts and management's judgment, the allowance for loan losses may be greater or lesser than future charge-offs. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $154.1 million and $205.8 million, respectively. The change in net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 was due primarily to a lower increase in deposits.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2021 and 2020 was $6.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively. This amount represents an effective tax rate of 22.0% and 18.9%, respectively. The Company's federal income tax rate was 21% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate compared to 2020 was due to a $396 thousand deferred tax valuation allowance established in 2021 on a state tax net operating loss at the holding company. The effective tax rate in both years were also impacted by tax exempt interest income and New Markets Tax Credits.\nDeposit Maturity\n\nCommitments to extend credit totaled $223.4 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to a total of $222.7 million at the end of 2020. The timing of these credit commitments varies with the underlying borrowers; however, the Company has satisfactory liquidity to fund these obligations as of December 31, 2021. The primary cash flow uncertainty would be a sudden decline in deposits causing the Banks to liquidate securities. Historically, the Banks have maintained an adequate level of short-term marketable investments to fund the temporary declines in deposit balances. There are no other known trends in liquidity and cash flow needs as of December 31, 2021, that are of concern to management.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLoans that the Banks have identified as having higher risk levels are reviewed individually in an effort to establish adequate loss reserves. These reserves are considered specific reserves and are directly impacted by the credit quality of the underlying loans. The specific reserves are dependent upon assumptions regarding the liquidation value of collateral and the cost of recovering collateral including legal fees. Changing the amount of specific reserves on individual loans has historically had a significant impact on the reallocation of the allowance among different parts of the portfolio. The following table sets forth information regarding changes in the Company's specific reserve on loans individually evaluated for impairment and loans individually evaluated for impairment for the most recent three years (dollars in thousands):\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d accompanying the Company's audited financial statements. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments, management has identified the allowance for loan losses, the fair value determination of investment securities and the assessment of goodwill to be the Company's most critical accounting policies.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOther factors considered when determining the adequacy of the general reserve include historical losses; watch, substandard and impaired loan volume; the ability to collect past due loans; loan growth; loan-to-value ratios; loan administration; collateral values; and economic factors. The Company's concentration risks include geographic concentration in Iowa; the local economy's dependence upon several large governmental entity employers, including Iowa State University; and the health of Iowa's agricultural sector that, in turn, is dependent on crop and livestock prices, weather conditions, trade policies and government programs. No assurances can be made that losses will remain at the relatively favorable levels experienced over the past five years.\nThe Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit that assist customers with their credit needs to conduct business. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, the most likely impact of these financial instruments on revenues, expenses, or cash flows of the Company would come from unidentified credit risk causing higher provision expense for loan losses in future periods. These financial instruments are not expected to have a significant impact on the liquidity or capital resources of the Company. For additional information, including quantification of the amounts involved, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Statements\u201d and the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of this discussion.\nNoninterest Income and Expense\n\nThe adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated quarterly by management, the Company and respective Bank boards. This evaluation focuses on specific loan reviews, changes in the type and volume of the loan portfolio given the current economic conditions and historical loss experience. Any one of the following conditions may result in the review of a specific loan: concern about whether the customer's cash flow or collateral are sufficient to repay the loan; delinquent status; criticism of the loan in a regulatory examination; the accrual of interest has been suspended; or other reasons, including when the loan has other special or unusual characteristics which warrant special monitoring.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company's credit risk is centered in the loan portfolio, which on December 31, 2021, totaled $1.14 billion as compared to $1.13 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 1.3%. Net loans comprise approximately 54% of total assets as of the end of 2021. The objective in managing loan portfolio risk is to reduce the risk of loss resulting from a customer's failure to perform according to the terms of a transaction and to quantify and manage credit risk on a portfolio basis. As the following chart indicates, the Company's non-performing assets have decreased by 16% from December 31, 2020 and total $13.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The Company's level of non-performing loans as a percentage of loans of 1.11% as of December 31, 2021, is higher than the Iowa State Average peer group of FDIC insured institutions as of December 31, 2021, of 0.45%. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2021 remains adequate based on its analysis of the non-performing assets and the portfolio as a whole.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n\nThe principal sources of Company revenues and cash flows are: (i) interest and fees earned on loans made or held by the Company and Banks; (ii) interest on investments, primarily on bonds, held by the Banks; (iii) fees on wealth management services; (iv) service charges on deposit accounts maintained at the Banks; (v) merchant and card fees; (vi) gain on the sale of loans held for sale; and (vii) securities gains. The Company's principal expenses are: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) salaries and employee benefits; (iii) data processing costs primarily associated with maintaining the Banks' loan and deposit functions; (iv) occupancy expenses for maintaining the Banks' facilities; (v) professional fees; and (vi) business development. The largest component contributing to the Company's net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets (primarily loans and investments) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposit accounts and other borrowings). One of management's principal functions is to manage the spread between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities in an effort to maximize net interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of interest rate risk.\n\nCertain of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are discussed in greater detail under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A herein.\n\nNon-performing Assets\nThese factors may not constitute all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statement. The Company operates in a continually changing business environment and new facts emerge from time to time. The Company cannot predict such factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such factors on its financial condition or its results of operations. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a predictor of actual results. The Company disclaims any responsibility to update any forward-looking statement provided in this document.\nLiquidity management is the process by which the Company, through its Banks' Asset and Liability Committees (ALCO), ensures adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. These commitments include funding credit obligations to borrowers, funding of mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market, withdrawals by depositors, maintaining adequate collateral for pledging for public funds, trust deposits and borrowings, paying dividends to shareholders, payment of operating expenses, funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAgricultural loans play an important part in the Banks' loan portfolios. Iowa is a major agricultural state and is a national leader in both grain and livestock production. The Banks play a significant role in their communities in financing operating, livestock and real estate activities for area producers.\n\nGoodwill arose in connection with four acquisitions consummated in previous periods. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if conditions indicate a possible impairment. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, determination of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Impairment would arise if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The Company completed a quantitative assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2021 which indicated that goodwill was not impaired. Subsequently, the Company determined there were no adverse changes in criteria and key considerations to the previous assessment. Accordingly, the Company concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2021. Goodwill may be impaired in the future if actual future test results differ from the present evaluation of impairment due to changes in the conditions used in the current evaluation. The effects of the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our net income, fair value and correspondingly goodwill. An impairment of goodwill would decrease the Company's earnings during the period in which the impairment is recorded.\n\nThe liquidity and capital resources discussion will cover the following topics:\n\n\nLoans Held For Sale\nGeneral reserves for loan categories range from 1.09% to 1.94% of the outstanding loan balances as of December 31, 2021. In general, as loan volume increases, the general reserve levels increase with that growth and as loan volume decreases, the general reserve levels decrease with that decline. The allowance relating to commercial real estate is the largest reserve component. Construction, commercial operating and agricultural operating loans have higher general reserve levels as a percentage than the other loan categories as management perceives more risk in this type of lending. Elements contributing to the higher risk level include a higher percentage of watch, special mention, substandard and impaired loans, and less favorable economic conditions for those portfolios. As of December 31, 2021, commercial real estate loans have general reserves ranging from 1.33% to 1.60%.\nThe provision for loan losses represents an expense charged against earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include: an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower; a realistic determination of value and adequacy of underlying collateral; historical charge-offs; the condition of the local economy; the condition of the specific industry of the borrower; an analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories; and a review of delinquent and classified loans.\n\nThe accrual of interest on nonaccrual and other impaired loans is generally discontinued at 90 days or when, in the opinion of management, the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received and when principal obligations are expected to be recoverable. Interest income on restructured loans is recognized pursuant to the terms of the new loan agreement. Interest income on other impaired loans remaining on accrual is monitored and income is recognized based upon the terms of the underlying loan agreement. However, the recorded net investment in impaired loans, including accrued interest, is limited to the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or the observable fair value of the loan's collateral.\nThe following table sets forth, on a tax-equivalent basis, a summary of the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates (in thousands).\nProvision (Credit) for Loan Losses\nAnother measure of interest rate sensitivity is the gap ratio. This ratio indicates the amount of interest-earning assets repricing within a given period in comparison to the amount of interest-bearing liabilities repricing within the same period of time. A gap ratio of 1.0 indicates a matched position, in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements will be minimal. A gap ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that more liabilities than assets reprice within the time period, while a ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that more assets reprice than liabilities.\nTotal investments as of December 31, 2021, were $831.0 million compared to $597.0 million as of year-end 2020. The investment portfolio provides the Company with a significant amount of liquidity since all investments are classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and have pretax net unrealized gains of $3.8 million and $21.4 million, respectively.\nSummary of the Allowance for Loan Losses\n\nOther sources of liquidity available to the Banks as of December 31, 2021 include available borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $309.4 million and federal funds borrowing capacity at correspondent banks of $107.8 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding FHLB advances of $3.0 million, no federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $39.9 million and no other borrowings. The Company also has a $4 million line of credit with an unaffiliated bank, with no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2021.\n\nFor further discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses and the process of establishing specific reserves, see the section of this Annual Report entitled Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\u201d and Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nThe following discussion is provided for the consolidated operations of the Company and its Banks. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant factors affecting the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nTotal assets increased to $2.14 billion in 2021 compared to $1.98 billion in 2020, or 8.2%. The increase was primarily due to investment securities which was funded by growth in our deposits due in part to federal government stimulus programs and a lack of other desirable fixed income alternatives for our customers.\nInvestment Maturities as of December 31, 2021\n\n\nManagement believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the current portfolio. This statement is based upon management's continuing evaluation of inherent risks in the current loan portfolio, current levels of classified assets and general economic factors. The Company will continue to monitor the allowance and make future adjustments to the allowance as conditions dictate. Due to potential changes in conditions, including the economic disruption and uncertainties resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nForward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such statement. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have magnified these risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:\nCertain key performance indicators for the Company and the industry are presented in the following chart. The industry figures are compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and are derived from 4,391 community banks and savings institutions insured by the FDIC. Management reviews these indicators on a quarterly basis for purposes of comparing the Company's performance from quarter to quarter against the industry as a whole.\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 109:

numbers or other factors, the interest rate environment may present a challenge to the Company. Increases in interest rates may negatively impact the Company's net interest margin if interest expense increases more quickly than interest income, thus placing downward pressure on net interest income. The Company's earning assets (primarily its loan and investment portfolio) have longer maturities than its interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and other borrowings); therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, interest expense will tend to increase more quickly than interest income as the interest-bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than earning assets, resulting in a reduction in net interest income. In response to this challenge, the Banks model quarterly the changes in income that would result from various changes in interest rates. Based on this modeling, management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks' interest rate risk positions.\n</td>

Moreover, changes in U.S. trade policy could create further volatility for commodities prices as the volume of exports of agricultural products to these foreign markets could be adversely impacted. Lastly, uncertainty regarding governmental mandates affecting ethanol production could reduce the demand for corn in the Company's trade area, thus introducing further price volatility for this commodity.
