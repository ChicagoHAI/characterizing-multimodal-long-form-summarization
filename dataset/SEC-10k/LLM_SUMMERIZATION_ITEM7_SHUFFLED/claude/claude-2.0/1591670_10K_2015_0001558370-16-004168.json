Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOverview and Background\nWe are an internally managed real estate company that owns and seeks to acquire high-quality farmland located in agricultural markets throughout North America. As of the date of this Annual Report, we own or have under contract 258 farms with an aggregate of 108,163 acres (including 5 farms totaling 8,591 acres under contract) in Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. As of the date of this Annual Report, the majority of the acres in our portfolio are used to grow primary crops, such as corn, soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton, while some of our farms produce specialty crops, such as blueberries, vegetables and edible beans. However, over the long term, we expect that our farmland portfolio will be comprised of approximately 80% primary crop farmland and 20% specialty crop farmland, which we believe will give investors exposure to the increasing global food demand trend in the face of growing scarcity of high quality farmland and will reflect the approximate breakdown of U.S. agricultural output between primary crops and animal protein (whose production relies principally on primary crops as feed), on one hand, and specialty crops, on the other. In addition, in August 2015, the Company announced the launch of the FPI Loan Program, an agricultural lending product aimed at farmers, as a complement to the Company's primary business of acquiring and owning farmland and leasing it to farmers. Under the FPI Loan Program, we intend to make loans to third-party farmers (both tenant and non-tenant) to provide partial financing for working capital requirements and operational farming activities, farming infrastructure projects, and for other farming and agricultural real estate related purposes.\nWe were incorporated in Maryland on September 27, 2013, and we are the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, which is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed on September 27, 2013. All of our assets are held by, and our operations are primarily conducted through, the Operating Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. As of the date of this Annual Report we own 64% of the common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( OP units\u201d) and none of the Series A preferred units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( Preferred Units\u201d). See Note 9 to our combined consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Preferred Units.\nWe succeeded to the operations of our predecessor, FP Land LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( FP Land\u201d or our Predecessor\u201d) upon completion of the underwritten initial public offering of 3,800,000 shares of our common stock (the IPO\u201d) on April 16, 2014. Concurrently with the completion of the IPO, FP Land merged with and into the Operating Partnership, with the Operating Partnership surviving (the FP Land Merger\u201d). As a result of the FP Land Merger, the Operating Partnership acquired the 38 farms and three grain storage facilities owned indirectly by our Predecessor and assumed the ownership and operation of our Predecessor's business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 74.1% of the OP units in the Operating Partnership.\nWe elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2014.\nRecent Developments\n2015 Completed Acquisitions\nDuring 2015, we completed 26 acquisitions, bringing the total to 56 acquisitions since the IPO. The 2015 acquisitions are described in further detail below. The 2015 acquisitions expanded our presence to four new states, bringing our total presence to twelve states. We also started acquiring permanent specialty crop farms.\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

The aggregate net proceeds to the Company, after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $34.6 million.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offering Program\nOn September 15, 2015, the Company filed a prospectus supplement under which it may sell shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $25,000,000 through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program. The offering is made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 14, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, no shares had been issued under the program.\nFinancing Activity\nThe Company and the Operating Partnership are parties to a bond purchase agreement (the Bond Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ( Farmer Mac\u201d) and Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities Corporation (the Purchaser\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Farmer Mac, as bond purchaser, regarding a secured note purchase facility (as amended, the Farmer Mac Facility\u201d) that had a maximum borrowing capacity of $165.0 million at December 31, 2015, with $160.6 million outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further details.\nOn February 29, 2016, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership (together, the Bridge Borrower\u201d) entered into a term loan agreement (the Bridge Loan Agreement\u201d) with MSD FPI Partners, LLC, an affiliate of MSD Partners, L.P. (the Bridge Lender\u201d), that provides for a loan of $53.0 million (the Bridge Loan\u201d), the proceeds of which were used primarily to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition of the Forsythe farms, which was completed on March 2, 2016. On March 14, 2016, we received from MetLife Agricultural Investments ( MetLife\u201d) commitments in the total aggregate amount of $127 million for mortgage loans secured by farmland. MetLife's loan commitments are subject to customary conditions, and expire between May 24, 2016 and June 14, 2016. We intend to use proceeds from these loans to refinance existing debt, to acquire new properties, and for general corporate purposes. We can provide no assurances that we will enter into a loan with MetLife on the terms we currently anticipate, or at all.\nThe Taxable REIT Subsidiary\nOn April 1, 2015, the TRS and Hough Farms entered into a custom farming arrangement, pursuant to which Hough Farms will perform custom farming on 563 acres. Additionally, the TRS plans to operate a volume purchasing program for participating tenants by working with suppliers to pool tenant purchasing abilities and create cost savings through bulk orders. This volume purchasing program is currently operated by the Company on a limited trial basis.\nFPI Loan Program\nIn August 2015, the Company introduced the FPI Loan Program, an agricultural lending product aimed at farmers as a complement to the Company's current business of acquiring and owning farmland and leasing it to farmers. Under the FPI Loan Program, the Company makes loans to third-party farmers (both tenant and non-tenant) to provide partial financing for working capital requirements and operational farming activities, farming infrastructure projects, and for other farming and agricultural real estate related projects. These loans are collateralized by farm real estate and are to be in principal amounts of $500,000 or more at fixed interest rates with maturities of up to three years. The Company expects the borrower to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements based on farming operations and access to other forms of capital, as permitted. Notes receivable are stated at their unpaid principal balance, and include unamortized direct origination costs and accrued interest through the reporting date, less any allowance for losses and unearned borrower paid points.\nOn August 24, 2015, the Company entered into a promissory note agreement with a third-party non-tenant farmer to provide up to $2,000,000 in the form of a mortgage note. The note is collateralized by a first mortgage on farm real estate. Currently, $1,800,000 has been funded with the remaining $200,000 of funding subject to the satisfaction of customary lending requirements, including finalization and issuance of the title research and appraisal report. The note has a fixed interest rate and all principal and accrued interest due at maturity, which was initially January 15, 2016 but has been extended by one year with the first year's interest received at the time of the extension.\nOn November 16, 2015, the Company entered into a promissory note agreement with a tenant farmer to provide $980,000 in the form of a mortgage note. The note has a fixed annual interest rate with principal and all accrued interest due at maturity on October 30, 2017. The note is collateralized by a first mortgage on farm real estate.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations and Farmland Values\nThe principal factors affecting our operating results and the value of our farmland include global demand for food relative to the global supply of food, farmland fundamentals and economic conditions in the markets in which we own\nfarmland, and our ability to increase or maintain rental revenues while controlling expenses. Although farmland prices may show a decline from time to time, we believe that any reduction in U.S. farmland values overall is likely to be short-lived as global demand for food and agricultural commodities typically exceeds global supply. In addition, although prices for many crops experienced significant declines in 2014 and 2015, we do not believe that such declines represent a trend that will continue over the long term. Rather, we believe that long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time.\nDemand\nWe expect that global demand for food, driven primarily by significant increases in the global population and GDP per capita, will continue to be the key driver of farmland values. We further expect that global demand for most crops will continue to grow to keep pace with global population growth, which we anticipate will lead to either higher prices and/or higher yields and, therefore, higher rental rates on our farmland, as well as sustained growth in farmland values over the long-term. We also believe that growth in global GDP per capita, particularly in developing nations, will contribute significantly to increasing demand for primary crops. As global GDP per capita increases, the composition of daily caloric intake is expected to shift away from the direct consumption of primary crops toward animal-based proteins, which is expected to result in increased demand for primary crops as feed for livestock. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization ( UN FAO\u201d), these factors are expected to require more than one billion additional tons of global annual grain production by 2050, a 45.5% increase from 2005-2007 levels and more than two times the 475 million tons of grain produced in the United States in 2014. Furthermore, we believe that, as GDP per capita grows, a significant portion of additional household income is allocated to food and that once individuals increase consumption of, and spending on, higher quality food, they will strongly resist returning to their former dietary habits, resulting in greater inelasticity in the demand for food. As a result, we believe that, as global demand for food increases, rental rates on our farmland and the value of our farmland will increase over the long-term. Global demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels such as ethanol and soy diesel also could impact the prices of corn and soybeans, which, in the long-term, could impact our rental revenues and our results of operations. However, the success of our business strategy is not dependent on growth in demand for biofuels and we do not believe that demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels will materially impact our results of operations or the value of our farmland, primarily because we believe that growth in global population and GDP per capita will be more significant drivers of global demand for primary crops over the long-term.\nSupply\nGlobal supply of agricultural commodities is driven by two primary factors, the number of tillable acres available for crop production and the productivity of the acres being farmed. Although the amount of global cropland in use has gradually increased over time, growth has plateaued over the last 20 years. Cropland area continues to increase in developing countries, but after accounting for expected continuing cropland loss, the UN FAO projects only 171 million acres will be added from 2005-2007 to 2050, a 4.3% increase. In comparison, world population is expected to grow over the same period to 9.7 billion, a nearly 40% increase. While we expect growth in the global supply of arable land, we also expect that landowners will only put that land into production if increases in commodity prices and the value of farmland cause landowners to benefit economically from using the land for farming rather than alternative uses. We also believe that decreases in the amount of arable land in the United States and globally as a result of increasing urbanization will partially offset the impact of additional supply of farmland. The global supply of food is also impacted by the productivity per acre of tillable land. Historically, productivity gains (measured by average crop yields) have been driven by advances in seed technology, farm equipment, irrigation techniques and chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, we expect the increasing shortage of water in many irrigated growing regions in the United States and other growing regions around the globe, often as a result of new water restrictions imposed by laws or regulations, to lead to decreased productivity growth on many acres and, in some cases, cause yields to decline on those acres.\nConditions in Our Existing Markets\nThe market for farmland is dominated by buyers who are existing farm owners and operators. As a result of a decline in commodity prices in 2014 and 2015, farmland values in many agricultural markets have experienced modest declines recently after substantial increases over the prior several years. While demand for agricultural commodities has\nbeen growing steadily, unusually favorable weather conditions in the world's major growing regions have led to a significant increase in supply. We believe that the current reduction in land values is likely to be limited and short-lived as global demand for food and agricultural commodities continues to outpace trendline supply, and represents a significant investment opportunity.\nAcross our entire portfolio, we are experiencing flat to modestly declining rent rates in connection with lease renewals. In order to offer our tenants a better match between cash inflows and outflows, in 2016 a higher portion than in 2015 of our fixed cash leases provides for payment of 50% of a year's rent after harvest. We believe quality farmland in the United States has a near-zero vacancy rate as a result of the supply and demand fundamentals discussed above. We believe rental rates for farmland are a function of farmland operators' view of the long-term profitability of farmland, and that many farm operators will continue to compete for farmland even during periods of decreased profitability due to the scarcity of farmland available to rent. In particular, we believe that due to the relatively high fixed costs associated with farming operations (including equipment, labor and knowledge), many farm operators in some circumstances will rent additional acres of farmland when it becomes available in order to allocate their fixed costs over more acres. Furthermore, because it is generally customary in the farming industry to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to re-lease the land at the end of each lease term, we believe that many farm operators will rent additional land that becomes available in order to control the ability to farm that land in future periods when profitability is higher. As a result, in our experience, many farm operators will aggressively pursue rental opportunities in close proximity to their existing operations when they arise, even when the farmer anticipates lower current returns or short-term losses. In addition, because many farmers both own farmland and rent additional farmland from other landowners, we believe that many farmers will choose to subsidize losses on rented land during periods of lower profitability with relatively higher profits generated by land that they own and that has comparatively lower fixed costs. Due to the short term nature of most of our leases, we believe that a recovery of crop prices and farm profitability will be reflected relatively rapidly in our revenues via increases in rent rates.\nLease Expirations\nFarm leases are often short-term in nature. As of December 31, 2015 our portfolio had the following lease expirations as a percentage of approximate acres leased and annualized minimum cash rents:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nApproximate\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\napproximate\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAnnual\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nannual\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nacres\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nacres\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncash rents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncash rents\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,763 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,283,858 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n10,879 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3,113,895 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,387 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n319,503 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,935 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3,595,995 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1,217 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n81,936 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n0.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53,181 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n100.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,395,187 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n100.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are currently negotiating leases on 3,158 acres, have 15,879 acres which have lease payments based on a percentage of farming revenues or crops and have 641 acres leased to our taxable REIT subsidiary, which are not included in the table above. We expect market rents in the coming year to be consistent with expiring rents.\nRental Revenues\nOur revenues are generated from renting farmland to operators of farming businesses. Our leases have terms ranging from one to five years. Although the majority of our leases do not provide the tenant with a contractual right to renew the lease upon its expiration, we believe it is customary to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to renew the lease, subject to any increase in the rental rate that we may establish. If the tenant elects not to renew the lease at the end of the lease term, the land will be offered to a new tenant.\nThe leases for the majority of the properties in our portfolio provide that tenants must pay us at least 50% (and often 100%) of the annual rent in advance of each spring planting season. As a result, we collect a significant portion of total annual rents in the first calendar quarter of each year. We believe our use of leases pursuant to which at least 50% of the\nannual rent is payable in advance of each spring planting season mitigates the tenant credit risk associated with the variability of farming operations that could be adversely impacted by poor crop yields, weather conditions, mismanagement, undercapitalization or other factors affecting our tenants. Prior to acquiring farmland property, we take into consideration the competitiveness of the local farm-operator tenant environment in order to enhance our ability to quickly replace a tenant that is unwilling to renew a lease or is unable to pay a rent payment when it is due. Some of our leases provide for a reimbursement of the property taxes we pay. We expect that, going forward, a progressively smaller percentage of our leases will provide for such a reimbursement.\nExpenses\nSubstantially all of the leases for our portfolio are structured in such a way that we are responsible for major maintenance, certain insurance and taxes (which are sometimes reimbursed to us by our tenants), while our tenant is responsible for minor maintenance, water usage and all of the additional input costs related to farming operations on the property, such as seed, fertilizer, labor and fuel. We expect that substantially all of the leases for farmland we acquire in the future will continue to be structured in a manner consistent with substantially all of our existing leases. As the owner of the land, we generally only bear costs related to major capital improvements permanently attached to the property, such as irrigation systems, drainage tile, grain storage facilities, permanent plantings or other physical structures customary for farms. In cases where capital expenditures are necessary, we typically seek to offset, over a period of multiple years, the costs of such capital expenditures by increasing rental rates. We also incur the costs associated with maintaining liability and casualty insurance.\nWe incur costs associated with running a public company, including, among others, costs associated with employing our personnel and compliance costs. We incur costs associated with due diligence and acquisitions, including, among others, travel expenses, consulting fees, and legal and accounting fees. We also incur costs associated with managing our farmland. The management of our farmland, generally, is not labor or capital intensive because farmland generally has minimal physical structures that require routine inspection and maintenance, and our leases, generally, are structured to require the tenant to pay many of the costs associated with the property. Furthermore, we believe that our platform is scalable, and we do not expect the expenses associated with managing our portfolio of farmland to increase significantly as the number of farm properties we own increases over time. Rather, we expect that as we continue to add additional farmland to our portfolio, we will be able to achieve economies of scale, which will enable us to reduce our operating costs per acre.\nCrop Prices\nOur exposure to short-term crop price declines is limited. The lease agreements with some of our tenants provide for a rent determined as a percentage of the farm's gross proceeds, but even in those cases our downside is generally limited by crop insurance, hedging, or a minimum cash rent. In addition, the impact of weaker crop prices is often offset by the higher crop yields that generally accompany lower crop prices.\nOur exposure to short-term crop price fluctuations, related to farming operations conducted by our TRS, is generally limited by current marketing contracts or other sales arrangements, which the Company may enter into throughout the growing season, and by the availability of grain storage capacity, which gives us the ability to delay the delivery of crops until after seasonal price declines.\nThe value of a crop is affected by many factors that can differ on a yearly basis. Weather conditions and crop disease in major crop production regions worldwide creates a significant risk of price volatility, which may either increase or decrease the value of the crops that our tenants produce each year. Other material factors adding to the volatility of crop prices are changes in government regulations and policy, fluctuations in global prosperity, fluctuations in foreign trade and export markets, and eruptions of military conflicts or civil unrest. Prices for many annual crops, particularly corn, experienced significant declines in 2014 and 2015, but we do not believe that such declines represent a trend that will continue over the long term. Rather, we believe that those declines in prices for annual crops represented a combination of correction to historical norms (adjusted for inflation) and high yields induced by unusually favorable weather patterns, and that continued long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time. Although annual rental payments under the majority of our leases are not based expressly on the\nquality or profitability of our tenants' harvests, any of these factors could adversely affect our tenants' ability to meet their obligations to us and our ability to lease or re-lease properties on favorable terms.\nInterest Rates\nWe expect that future changes in interest rates will impact our overall operating performance by, among other things, increasing our borrowing costs. While we may seek to manage our exposure to future changes in rates through interest rate swap agreements or interest rate caps, portions of our overall outstanding debt will likely remain at floating rates. In addition, a sustained material increase in interest rates may cause farmland prices to decline if the rise in real interest rates (which is defined as nominal interest rates minus the inflation rate) is not accompanied by rises in the general levels of inflation. However, our business model anticipates that the value of our farmland will increase, as it has in the past, at a rate that is equal to or greater than the rate of inflation, which may in part offset the impact of rising interest rates on the value of our farmland, but there can be no guarantee that this appreciation will occur to the extent that we anticipate or at all.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in the notes to the historical combined consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing. We have set forth below those accounting policies that we believe require material subjective or complex judgments and have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis, based on information that is then available to us, our experience and various matters that we believe are reasonable and appropriate for consideration under the circumstances.\nReal Estate Acquisitions\nWe account for all acquisitions in accordance with the business combinations standard. When we acquire farmland that was previously operated as a rental property, we evaluate whether a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of closing of the acquisition. If a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of acquisition, we account for the transaction as a business combination and charge the costs associated with the acquisition to acquisition and due diligence costs on the statement of operations as incurred. Otherwise, acquisitions with no lease in place or crops being produced at the time of acquisition are accounted for as asset acquisitions. When we acquire farmland in a sale-lease back transaction with newly originated leases entered into with the seller, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition and capitalize the transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition.\nUpon acquisition of real estate, we allocate the purchase price of the real estate based upon the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, which historically have consisted of land, drainage improvements, irrigation improvements, groundwater, permanent plantings (bushes, shrubs, vines, perennials) and grain facilities and may also consist of intangible assets including in-place leases, above market and below market leases and tenant relationships. We allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of acquired real estate by valuing the land as if it were unimproved. We value improvements, including permanent plantings and grain facilities, at replacement cost as new adjusted for depreciation.\nOur estimates of land value are made using a comparable sales analysis. Factors considered by us in our analysis of land value include soil types and water availability and the sales prices of comparable farms. Our estimates of groundwater value are made using historical information obtained regarding the applicable aquifer. Factors considered by us in our analysis of groundwater value are related to the location of the aquifer and whether or not the aquifer is a depletable resource or a replenishing resource. If the aquifer is a replenishing resource, no value is allocated to the groundwater. We include an estimate of property taxes in the purchase price allocation of acquisitions to account for the expected liability that was assumed.\nWhen above or below market leases are acquired, we value the intangible assets based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases that are considered bargain renewal options. The above market lease values will be amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases. The fair value of acquired below market leases, included in deferred revenue on the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets, is amortized as an increase of rental income on a straight-line basis over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases, plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options of the respective leases.\nThe purchase price is allocated to in-place lease values and tenant relationships, if they are acquired, based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. The value of in-place lease intangibles and tenant relationships will be included as components of deferred leasing intangibles, and will be amortized over the remaining lease term (and expected renewal periods of the respective leases for tenant relationships) as amortization expense. If a tenant terminates its lease prior to its stated expiration, any unamortized amounts relating to that lease, including (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place lease values, and (iii) tenant relationships, would be recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate. We capitalize acquisition costs and due diligence costs if the asset is expected to qualify as an asset acquisition. If the asset acquisition is abandoned, the capitalized asset acquisition costs will be expensed to acquisition and due diligence costs in the period of abandonment.\nTotal consideration for acquisitions may include a combination of cash and equity securities. When equity securities are issued, we determine the fair value of the equity securities issued based on the number of shares of common stock and OP units issued multiplied by the stock price on the date of closing in the case of common stock and OP units, and on liquidation preference in the case of Preferred Units.\nUsing information available at the time of acquisition, we allocate the total consideration to tangible assets and liabilities and identified intangible assets and liabilities. We may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocations after obtaining more information about asset valuations and liabilities assumed.\nReal Estate\nOur real estate consists of land, groundwater and improvements made to the land consisting of grain facilities, irrigation improvements, other assets and drainage improvements. We record real estate at cost and capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. We expense costs of repairs and maintenance as such costs are incurred. We begin depreciating assets when the asset is ready for its intended use. We compute depreciation and depletion for assets classified as improvements using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 10-40 years for grain facilities, 2-40 years for irrigation improvements, 27-65 for drainage improvements, 3-50 years for groundwater, 23 years for permanent plantings, and 5-40 years for other assets acquired. We periodically evaluate the estimated useful lives for groundwater based on current state water regulations and depletion levels of the aquifers.\nWhen a sale occurs, we recognize the associated gain when all consideration has been transferred, the sale has closed, and there is no material continuing involvement. If a sale is expected to generate a loss, we first assess it through the impairment evaluation process-see \u2018\u2018Impairment of Real Estate Assets'' below.\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets\nWe evaluate our tangible and identifiable intangible real estate assets for impairment indicators whenever events such as declines in a property's operating performance, deteriorating market conditions, or environmental or legal concerns bring recoverability of the carrying value of one or more assets into question. If such events are present, we project the total undiscounted cash flows of the asset, including proceeds from disposition, and compare it to the net book value of the asset. If this evaluation indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in earnings equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There have been no impairments recognized on real estate assets in the accompanying financial statements.\nInventory of our TRS\nThe costs of growing crop are accumulated until the time of harvest at the lower of cost or market value and are included in inventory in our combined consolidated financial statements. Costs are allocated to growing crops based on a percentage of the total costs of production and total operating costs that are attributable to the portion of the crops that remain in inventory at the end of the year. Growing crop consists primarily of land preparation, cultivation, irrigation and fertilization costs incurred by FPI Agribusiness. Growing crop inventory is charged to cost of products sold when the related crop is harvested and sold.\nHarvested crop inventory includes costs accumulated during both the growing and harvesting phases and is stated at the lower of those costs or the estimated net realizable value, which is the market price, based upon the nearest market in the geographic region, less any cost of disposition. Cost of disposition includes broker's commissions, freight and other marketing costs.\nOther inventory, such as fertilizer and pesticides, is valued at the lower of cost or market.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental income includes rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its lease. Minimum rents pursuant to leases are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including renewal options in the case of below market leases. Deferred revenue includes the cumulative difference between the rental revenue recorded on a straight-line basis and the cash rent received from tenants in accordance with the lease terms. Acquired below market leases are included in deferred revenue on the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets, which are amortized into rental income over the life of the respective leases, plus the terms of the below market renewal options, if any.\nLeases in place as of December 31, 2015 had terms ranging from one to five years. As of December 31, 2015 we had 17 leases with renewal options and three leases with rent escalations. The majority of our leases provide for a fixed cash rent payment. Tenant leases on acquired farms generally require the tenant to pay the Company rent for the entire initial year regardless of the date of acquisition, if the acquisition is closed prior to, or shortly after, planting of crops. If the acquisition is closed later in the year, we typically receive a partial rent payment or no rent payment at all.\nCertain of our leases provide for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds, a percentage of harvested crops, or a fixed crop quantity at a fixed price. As of December 31, 2015, a majority of such leases provided for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds. Revenue under leases providing for a payment equal to a percentage of the harvested crop or a percentage of the gross farm proceeds is recognized upon notification from the grain facility that grain has been delivered in the our name or when the tenant has notified us of the total amount of gross farm proceeds.\nCertain of our leases provide for minimum cash rent plus a bonus based on gross farm proceeds. Revenue under this type of lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term based on the minimum cash rent. Bonus rent is recognized upon notification from the tenant of the gross farm proceeds for the year.\nTenant reimbursements include reimbursements for real estate taxes that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its lease. When leases require that the tenant reimburse us for property taxes paid by us, the reimbursement is reflected as tenant reimbursement revenue on the statements of operations, as earned, and the related property tax as property operating expense, as incurred. When a lease requires that the tenant pay the taxing authority directly, we do not incur this cost. If and when it becomes probable that a tenant will not be able to bear the property-related costs, we will accrue the estimated expense.\nWe record revenue from the sale of harvested crops when the harvested crop has been delivered to a grain facility and\ntitle has transferred. Harvested crops delivered under marketing contracts are recorded using the fixed price of the marketing contract at the time of delivery to a grain facility. Harvested crops delivered without a marketing contract are recorded using the market price at the date the harvested crop is delivered to the grain facility and title has transferred.\nWe recognize interest income on notes receivable on an accrual basis over the life of the note. Direct origination costs are netted against loan origination fees and are amortized over the life of the note using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, as an adjustment to interest income which is included in operating revenue as a component of other income in the our Combined Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a REIT, for income tax purposes we are permitted to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders, thereby eliminating the U.S. federal taxation of income represented by such distributions at the Company level, provided certain requirements are met. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.\nThe Operating Partnership leases certain of its farms to the TRS, which is subject to federal and state income taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis and for operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not they will be realized on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. There was no taxable income from the TRS for the year ended December 31, 2015, and at December 31, 2015, we did not have any deferred tax assets or liabilities.\nWe perform an annual review for any uncertain tax positions and, if necessary, will record future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements. An uncertain tax position is defined as a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is not based on clear and unambiguous tax law and which is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. At December 31, 2015 we did not identify any uncertain tax positions.\nWhen we acquire a property in a business combination, we evaluate such acquisition for any related deferred tax assets or liabilities and determine if a deferred tax asset or liability should be recorded in conjunction with the purchase price allocation. If a built-in gain is acquired, we evaluate the required holding period (generally 5-10 years) and determine if we have the ability and intent to hold the underlying assets for the necessary holding period. If we have the ability to hold the underlying assets for the required holding period, no deferred tax liability will be recorded with respect to the built-in gain.\nNew or Revised Accounting Standards\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08\u201d). Under this revised guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations, such as a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business or a major equity method investment, will be presented as discontinued operations. The standard requires prospective application and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014 with early adoption permitted. The early adoption provision excludes components of an entity that were sold or classified as held for sale prior to the adoption of the standard. We elected to early adopt this standard effective January 1, 2014. Because there were no dispositions for the year ended December 31, 2014 and guidance is applied prospectively, there was no impact to our statements of operations or financial position.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 ( ASU 2014-09\u201d). ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is prohibited. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's combined consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ended December 31, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which amends or supersedes the scope and consolidation guidance under existing GAAP. The new standard changes the way a reporting entity evaluates whether (a) limited partnerships and similar entities should be consolidated, (b) fees paid to decision makers or service providers are variable interests in a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d), and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties require the reporting entity to consolidate the VIE. ASU 2015-02 also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We intend to adopt this pronouncement during the three months ending March 31, 2016, and do not anticipate a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows from adopting this standard.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d). ASU 2015-03 requires the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred charge asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-03 as of June 30, 2015. All periods presented have been retroactively adjusted.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) (\"ASU 2015-11\"). The amendments require that an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated sales price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated With Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting ( ASU 2015-15\u201d), which clarified that the SEC would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. ASU 2015-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. We have assessed the impact of ASU 2015-15 and it does not have a material effect on our combined consolidated financial statements or financial covenants.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments ( ASU 2015-16\u201d), pertaining to entities that have reported provisional amounts for items in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized. The guidance requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Any adjustments should be calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-16 for the quarterly period ending December 31, 2015.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is expected to impact our consolidated financial statements as the we have an operating lease arrangement for which we are the lessee. ASC 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840 Leases. The standard is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nTable 125: <table> <tr>

fourth quarter, in addition to the 26 acquisitions that took place throughout 2015. To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we have separately discussed the rental income for the same-property portfolio, which includes only properties owned and operated for the entirety of both periods presented. The same-property portfolio for the periods presented includes the 38 farms and three grain storage facilities contributed to us by our Predecessor at the time of the IPO.\nTotal rental income increased $9,577,220, or 241.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of the 55 acquisitions completed over the last two years. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio increased to $215 per acre from $179 per acre in 2014. This increase was the result of diversification of our portfolio to new markets.\nCash rental income for the same-property portfolio decreased to $2,615,718 for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2,634,525 for 2014, as a result of average annual rent for the same-property portfolio decreasing to $357 per acre in 2015 from $360 per acre in 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower crop share rent in 2015.\nLeases in place in 2014 that provide for tenant payment of property taxes required the tenant to reimburse us for the tax amount we paid in 2015 for the 2014 taxable year. Due to changes in terms of lease renewals, as well as of certain outstanding leases, tenant reimbursements decreased $112,367, or 45.4%, in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nOther revenues totaled $73,169 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to no other revenues realized in 2014. The other revenues recognized during 2015 were generated on interest and amortization of net loan fees, primarily from the FPI Loan Program, launched in August 2015. An initial $1,800,000 mortgage note receivable was issued in August 2015, and a $980,000 mortgage note was issued to a separate party in November 2015. See - Recent Developments-FPI Loan Program.\u201d\nDepreciation and depletion expense increased $564,733, or 171.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is the result of acquiring $7,468,127 in depreciable assets in the last quarter of 2014, $7,000,392 in depreciable assets throughout 2015 and investing $5,637,733 in property improvements on acquired property during 2015.\nProperty operating expenses increased $855,015, or 343.9%, for the 2015 year, as compared to the prior year, of which $243,416 is attributable to acquired properties during 2015. The remaining increase in property operating expenses is primarily related to increases in property insurance of $111,694, property taxes of $224,062, state franchise taxes of $113,137, and repairs of $53,650. Also increasing during the year were travel costs related to property visits on newly acquired properties of $42,987 and $48,076 expensed for legal costs related to tenant issues.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1,916,699, or 84.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was largely the result of increased costs related to being a public company and our continued growth. We only incurred the costs of being a public company during the period following our IPO in 2014, while we incurred such costs for the entire year in 2015. During 2015, our public company costs increased $255,133 due to increased investor relations, board, regulatory and compliance activity, stock-based compensation expense increased $189,844, conference attendance and travel expenses increased $251,913, consulting fees increased $223,667, and other corporate costs increased $29,921, due to increased rent and general office expenses related to increased headcount, as compared with the same period in 2014. Also contributing to the general and administrative increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 were employee compensation expenses, which increased $1,185,817 as compared with the same period in 2014, as we did not have any employees prior to the IPO and have since increased our staffing to 13 employees and added a formal bonus program in the third quarter of 2014. These increases were offset by a decrease of $219,597 in professional fees which were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, on behalf of the Company by Pittman Hough Farms prior to the completion of the IPO.\nLegal and accounting expenses increased $475,001, or 77.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of being a public company for a full year with the Company going public in April 2014. Also contributing to the increase in legal and accounting expenses were general corporate matters and the growth of our portfolio.\nOther income decreased by $45,654, or 31.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. During both periods other income was recognized on the sale of easements and right-of-way.\nInterest expense increased by $3,244,272 or 236.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of an increase in our average outstanding borrowings, which were $159,233,978 during the year December 31, 2015 and $44,426,322 for 2014. Our weighted average cost of borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 2.80% and 2.76%, respectively. We also recognized additional interest expense of $225,134 and $138,369 during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred loan fees. These increases were partially offset by the amortization of a premium on our debt of $69,989 during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended

2014 and one acquisition made during the year ended December 31, 2013. To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we have separately discussed the rental income for the same-property portfolio, which includes only properties owned and operated for the entirety of both periods presented. The same-property portfolio for the periods presented includes only the original farms which were contributed at the IPO date.\nTotal rental income increased approximately $1,620,436, or 69.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily resulting from the completion of 29 acquisitions during 2014, 19 of which were completed in December. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio decreased to $179 per acre from $326 per acre in 2013. The decrease in average annual cash rent per acre is a result of an emphasis of our acquisition activity on farmland characterized by lower price and rent per acre than the pre-existing portfolio. As a result of completing 19 acquisitions in December 2014, we did not have leases in place for all properties and did not receive rental income on the majority of the properties acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nRental income for the same-property portfolio increased $265,554, or 11.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of average annual cash rent for the same-property portfolio increasing to $365 per acre for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $327 per acre in 2013.\nTenant reimbursements increased $247,664 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, and property operating expenses increased $211,108 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Both of these increases are due to the fact that in 2013, all but two of our leases required the tenants to directly pay all expenses incurred during the lease term in connection with the leased farms, including property taxes and maintenance. In 2014, leases that formerly provided for tenant payment of property taxes, requireed the tenant to reimburse us for the amount we paid in 2015. We accrued the expected tenant reimbursements for the year ended December 31, 2014, which are expected to be paid in 2015. Additionally, the tenants on the Hudye farms were required to reimburse us $18,595 for the 2013 taxes payable in 2014.\nDepreciation and depletion expense increased $180,029, or 121.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of our investments in irrigation equipment as well as increased depreciation related to the $127,800,000 in acquisitions completed during 2014, of which $10,000,000 related to depreciable assets.\nAcquisition and due diligence costs increased $193,039 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of $111,377 in costs directly related to the six business combinations completed in 2014, $70,377 in costs directly related to asset acquisitions that were abandoned and due diligence efforts on other prospective business combinations.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2,120,300 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expenses was a result largely of the beginning of our operations as an independent, publicly traded company and our subsequent rapid growth and more specifically, $648,177 increase in employee compensation as we did not have any employees prior to the IPO, $123,958 incurred related to the shared services agreement with Pittman Hough Farms, $53,125 incurred related to a consulting agreement entered into on April 16, 2014, $680,540 in amortization of restricted stock granted in conjunction with the IPO, $254,741in costs incurred as a result of becoming a public company, Board of Directors expenses of $196,504, travel costs of $58,853 and $219,597 in professional fees that FP Land agreed to reimburse Pittman Hough Farms prior to the completion of the IPO.\nLegal and accounting expenses decreased $16,755 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. In 2014, the Company incurred $537,533 in audit and accounting fees and $77,805 in legal fees, as a result of becoming a public company. In 2013, the Company incurred $620,000 related to the preparation of financial statements for use in connection with the IPO.\nGain on sale of easement was $144,020 for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, the Company entered into a transmission easement with a power company in Illinois for $144,020.\nInterest expense increased by $29,868, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of an increase in interest related to the Farmer Mac Facility of $238,933 and an increase in the amortization of deferred financing fees of $80,392, which was offset by interest savings of $268,545 as a result of repaying $12.2 million in outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2014, we had $81.1 million outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay any outstanding borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and to OP unitholders, and other general business needs.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland and make other investments consistent with our investment strategy, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT and fund our operations. Our sources of funds primarily will be cash on hand, operating cash flows and borrowings from prospective lenders.\nOn February 29, 2016, we closed on a $53,000,000 bridge term loan (the Bridge Loan\u201d), with the proceeds used to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the Forsythe Farm acquisition. The term note has a maturity of two months, with three one-month extension options, subject to the payment of a 1% extension fee at each extension, and has an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 3%.\nOver the next twelve months, $84,750,000 of our borrowings will mature. To satisfy our maturing debt obligations, we intend to utilize a combination of our expected cash flow from operations, and proceeds from debt refinancings from prospective lenders and potential equity issuances. Any cash that we use to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations will\nreduce the amounts available to acquire additional farms, which could adversely affect our growth prospects. On March 14, 2016, we received from MetLife Agricultural Investments (\"MetLife\") commitments in the total aggregate amount of $127 million for mortgage loans secured by farmland. MetLife's loan commitments are subject to customary conditions, and expire between May 24, 2016 and June 14, 2016. We intend to use proceeds from these loans to refinance existing debt, to acquire new properties, and for general corporate purposes. We can provide no assurances that we will enter into a loan with MetLife on the terms we currently anticipate, or at all. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Properties-We have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding and significant near-term maturities, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations, restrict our operations and our ability to grow our business and revenues and restrict our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.\u201d\nIn addition to utilizing current and any future available borrowings, we entered into equity distribution agreements on September 15, 2015, under which we may issue and sell from time to time, through the sales agents, shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $25,000,000. This at-the-market\u201d equity offering program is intended to provide additional financing alternatives in the capital markets and we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering, if any, for future farmland acquisitions in accordance with our investment strategy and for general corporate purposes, which may also include originating loans to farmers under our recently announced loan program. We only intend to utilize the equity offering should the market price of our common stock reach levels which are deemed appropriate.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland, make other investments and certain long-term capital expenditures, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, and make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including future equity issuances (including issuances of OP units), net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings.\nOur ability to incur additional debt will depend on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets, borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders and the conditions of debt markets. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will depend on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company.\nConsolidated Indebtedness\nFirst Midwest Loan\nIn connection with the IPO and the related formation transactions, on April 16, 2014, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and First Midwest Bank, as lender, entered into the Amended and Restated Business Loan Agreement, as amended on February 24, 2015, July 24, 2015 and on March 6, 2016 (the FMW Loan Agreement\u201d), which provided for loans in the initial aggregate principal amount of approximately $30,780,000 (together, the First Midwest Loan\u201d). The First Midwest Loan is secured by first mortgages and assignments of rents encumbering 24 of our farms and two of our grain storage facilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had $26,650,000 outstanding under the First Midwest Loan.\nThe First Midwest Loan has a maturity date of June 4, 2016, with respect to $26,000,000 of the currently outstanding principal of the loan, and the remaining balance matures on June 28, 2016. The loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 2.59%, but in any event not less than a rate per annum of 2.80%, and requires us to make quarterly interest payments on the 30th day of each calendar quarter and a principal payment of $26,000,000 on June 16, 2016.\nThe balance of the First Midwest Loan may be prepaid by us in whole or in part without any prepayment penalties. The First Midwest Loan contains customary events of default, including defaults in the payment of principal or interest, defaults in compliance with the covenants contained in the documents evidencing the loans, defaults in payments under any other documents covering any part of the properties, and bankruptcy or other insolvency events.\nIn connection with the FMW Loan Agreement, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership unconditionally agreed to guarantee all of the obligations of the Operating Partnership under the FMW Loan Agreement. In addition, Paul A. Pittman, our Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jesse J. Hough, our\nconsultant, unconditionally agreed to jointly and severally guarantee $11,000,000 of the Operating Partnership's obligations under the FMW Loan Agreement. On February 24, 2015, we amended the FMW Loan Agreement to revise the financial covenants. On March 6, 2016, we amended the FMW Loan Agreement to extend its maturity by three months, to June 4, 2016, with respect to $26,000,000 of the currently outstanding principal.\nUnder the FMW Loan Agreement, we are subject to ongoing compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio of 0.60 to 1.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.00. Each covenant is measured annually as of December 31st of each year. Additionally, we are required to maintain a minimum cash account balance of $500,000 during the term of the agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2015.\nFarmer Mac Facility\nWe are party to the Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2015 and subsequently amended (the Bond Purchase Agreement\u201d), with Farmer Mac and the Purchaser, regarding a secured bond purchase facility that as of December 31, 2015 has a maximum borrowing capacity of $165 million. Pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, the Operating Partnership may, from time to time, issue one or more bonds to the Purchaser that will be secured by pools of mortgage loans, which will, in turn, be secured by first liens on agricultural real estate owned by us. The mortgage loans may have effective loan-to-value ratios of up to 60%, after giving effect to the overcollateralization obligations described below. Prepayment of each bond issuance is not permitted unless otherwise agreed upon by all parties to the Bond Purchase Agreement.\nThe Farmer Mac Facility includes a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including: a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 60%; a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.00, beginning after the second quarter of 2015; and a minimum tangible net worth. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2015. On August 3, 2015, we amended the Bond Purchase Agreement in order to calculate the fixed charge coverage ratio using our Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement) rather than our EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement).\nIn connection with the Bond Purchase Agreement, we and the Operating Partnership are also party to the Amended and Restated Pledge and Security agreement, dated as of March 1, 2015 (the Pledge Agreement\u201d) in favor of the Purchaser and Farmer Mac, pursuant to which we and the Operating Partnership agreed to pledge, as collateral for the Farmer Mac Facility, all of their respective right, title and interest in (i) mortgage loans with a value at least equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding bond held by the Purchaser and (ii) such additional collateral as necessary to have total collateral with a value at least equal to 110% of the outstanding notes held by the Purchaser. In addition, we agreed to guarantee the full performance of the Operating Partnership's duties and obligations under the Pledge Agreement.\nThe Bond Purchase Agreement and the Pledge Agreement include customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which, after any applicable cure period, would permit the Purchaser and Farmer Mac to, among other things, accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility and to exercise its remedies with respect to the pledged collateral, including foreclosure and sale of the agricultural real estate underlying the pledged mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2015, we had $160,575,000 outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn February 29, 2016, the Bridge Borrower entered into the Bridge Loan Agreement with the Bridge Lender that provides for a loan of $53.0 million, the proceeds of which were used primarily to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition of the Forsythe farms, which was completed on March 2, 2016. The Company is currently in negotiations with certain lenders to provide long-term secured debt financing to repay the Bridge Loan at or prior to its maturity, but the Company can provide no assurances that it will be able to enter into such financing on favorable terms or at all.\nThe Bridge Loan matures on April 29, 2016, subject to three one-month extensions at the Bridge Borrower's option, and is secured by first lien mortgages on the Forsythe farms. Interest on the Bridge Loan is payable in cash monthly and\naccrues at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum. In addition, under the Bridge Loan Agreement, the Bridge Borrower paid an origination fee of 4.00% of the loan amount and is required to pay an extension fee of 1.00% of the loan amount for each one-month extension and a default fee of 2.00% of the loan amount if the Bridge Loan is not repaid at maturity. The Bridge Borrower may prepay the Bridge Loan, subject to paying the Lender any LIBOR brokerage costs.\nIn connection with the Term Loan, on February 29, 2016, the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into a guaranty (the Guaranty\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed unconditionally to guarantee all of the Bridge Borrower's obligations under the Bridge Loan.\nThe Bridge Loan Agreement contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, including: (i) the use of proceeds of the Bridge Loan must be used in connection with the acquisition of the Forsythe farms and (ii) the Bridge Borrower is generally restricted from incurring any additional indebtedness.\nThe Guaranty contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including: (i) a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 60%; (ii) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter; (iii) a minimum tangible net worth; (iv) a general restriction on incurring additional indebtedness subject to certain exceptions, including indebtedness for property acquisitions of up to $6.0 million; (v) a restriction on investments in excess of $10.0 million in the aggregate without the prior written consent of the Lender subject to certain limited exceptions; and (vi) a restriction on modifying terms of the Preferred Units (as defined below).\nThe Bridge Loan Agreement includes certain customary events of default, including a cross-default provision related to other outstanding indebtedness of the Company and the Operating Partnership, the occurrence of any of which, after any applicable cure period, would permit the Bridge Lender, among other things, to accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Loan and to exercise its remedies with respect to the pledged collateral, including foreclosure and sale of the Forsythe farms.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

addition, on February 29, 2016, we closed on the $53,000,000 Bridge Loan, which has a maturity date of April 29, 2016, with three one-month extension options, subject to the payment of a 1% extension fee at each extension.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Adjusted Funds from Operations ( AFFO\u201d)\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate related depreciation, depletion and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management presents FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance\nmeasure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of improvements on our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nWe do not, however, believe that FFO is the only measure of the sustainability of our operating performance. Changes in GAAP accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in FFO that do not correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance. Therefore, in addition to FFO, we present AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company's operational performance than FFO. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. Even AFFO, however, does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts, especially in connection with full-year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms. Management considers AFFO per share, fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to GAAP earnings per share. AFFO per share, fully diluted provides additional insight into how our operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted and, accordingly, our AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted may not always be comparable to AFFO and AFFO per share amounts calculated by other REITs. AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to net income (loss) earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.\nAFFO is calculated by adjusting FFO to exclude or include the income and expenses that we believe are not reflective of the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance, as further explained below:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCrop year adjusted revenue. In accordance with GAAP, rental payments are recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. With respect to leases entered into on acquired property, crop year adjusted revenue represents the difference between the pro rata contractual cash revenue for each crop year spread equally over the quarterly periods of ownership (without regard to the date of acquisition within the quarter) and the rent recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP. This application results in income recognition that can differ significantly from the current GAAP accounting. By adjusting for this item, we believe AFFO, provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our leases on a crop year basis, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nStock based compensation.

we had 16,155,971 and 9,676,755 shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, respectively.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a key financial measure used to evaluate our operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, cash flows from operating activities or net income, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA is a standard performance measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts and investors in our industry. However, while EBITDA is a performance measure widely used across several industries, we do not believe that it correctly captures\nour business operating performance because it includes non-cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand our business operating performance. Therefore, in addition to EBITDA, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth in the table below.\nWe further adjust EBITDA for certain additional items such as crop year adjusted revenue, stock based compensation, indirect equity offering costs, real estate acquisition related audit fees and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs (for a full discussion of these adjustments see AFFO adjustments discussed above) that we consider necessary to understand our operating performance.

As a result, we believe that the effect on us of inflationary increases in operating expenses may be offset in part by the operating expenses that are passed through to our tenants and by contractual rent increases because our leases will be renegotiated every one to five years. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\nSeasonality\nBecause the leases for a majority of the properties in our portfolio require payment of at least 50% of the annual rent in advance of each spring planting season, we receive a significant portion of our cash rental payments in the first calendar quarter of each year, although we recognize rental revenue from these leases on a pro rata basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease in accordance with GAAP.", "item_7_truncated": "Lease Expirations\nOn February 29, 2016, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership (together, the Bridge Borrower\u201d) entered into a term loan agreement (the Bridge Loan Agreement\u201d) with MSD FPI Partners, LLC, an affiliate of MSD Partners, L.P. (the Bridge Lender\u201d), that provides for a loan of $53.0 million (the Bridge Loan\u201d), the proceeds of which were used primarily to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition of the Forsythe farms, which was completed on March 2, 2016. On March 14, 2016, we received from MetLife Agricultural Investments ( MetLife\u201d) commitments in the total aggregate amount of $127 million for mortgage loans secured by farmland. MetLife's loan commitments are subject to customary conditions, and expire between May 24, 2016 and June 14, 2016. We intend to use proceeds from these loans to refinance existing debt, to acquire new properties, and for general corporate purposes. We can provide no assurances that we will enter into a loan with MetLife on the terms we currently anticipate, or at all.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is expected to impact our consolidated financial statements as the we have an operating lease arrangement for which we are the lessee. ASC 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840 Leases. The standard is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance.\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was largely the result of increased costs related to being a public company and our continued growth. We only incurred the costs of being a public company during the period following our IPO in 2014, while we incurred such costs for the entire year in 2015. During 2015, our public company costs increased $255,133 due to increased investor relations, board, regulatory and compliance activity, stock-based compensation expense increased $189,844, conference attendance and travel expenses increased $251,913, consulting fees increased $223,667, and other corporate costs increased $29,921, due to increased rent and general office expenses related to increased headcount, as compared with the same period in 2014. Also contributing to the general and administrative increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 were employee compensation expenses, which increased $1,185,817 as compared with the same period in 2014, as we did not have any employees prior to the IPO and have since increased our staffing to 13 employees and added a formal bonus program in the third quarter of 2014. These increases were offset by a decrease of $219,597 in professional fees which were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, on behalf of the Company by Pittman Hough Farms prior to the completion of the IPO.\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFarm Name\n</td> <td>\nCounty\n</td> <td>\nTotal approximate acres\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPurchase price\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCondrey\n</td> <td>\nCatahoula, LA\n</td> <td>\n7,400 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n31,750,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBuckelew\n</td> <td>\nPanola, MS\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2,304,200 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGurga\n</td> <td>\nMason, IL\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n668,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBrett\n</td> <td>\nJohnson, GA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n575,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPowell\n</td> <td>\nJohnson, GA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n955,084 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n8,591 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n36,252,284 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe costs of growing crop are accumulated until the time of harvest at the lower of cost or market value and are included in inventory in our combined consolidated financial statements. Costs are allocated to growing crops based on a percentage of the total costs of production and total operating costs that are attributable to the portion of the crops that remain in inventory at the end of the year. Growing crop consists primarily of land preparation, cultivation, irrigation and fertilization costs incurred by FPI Agribusiness. Growing crop inventory is charged to cost of products sold when the related crop is harvested and sold.\nOverview\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

In accordance with GAAP, rental payments are recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. With respect to leases entered into on acquired property, crop year adjusted revenue represents the difference between the pro rata contractual cash revenue for each crop year spread equally over the quarterly periods of ownership (without regard to the date of acquisition within the quarter) and the rent recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP. This application results in income recognition that can differ significantly from the current GAAP accounting. By adjusting for this item, we believe AFFO, provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our leases on a crop year basis, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. \nWe incur costs associated with running a public company, including, among others, costs associated with employing our personnel and compliance costs. We incur costs associated with due diligence and acquisitions, including, among others, travel expenses, consulting fees, and legal and accounting fees. We also incur costs associated with managing our farmland. The management of our farmland, generally, is not labor or capital intensive because farmland generally has minimal physical structures that require routine inspection and maintenance, and our leases, generally, are structured to require the tenant to pay many of the costs associated with the property. Furthermore, we believe that our platform is scalable, and we do not expect the expenses associated with managing our portfolio of farmland to increase significantly as the number of farm properties we own increases over time. Rather, we expect that as we continue to add additional farmland to our portfolio, we will be able to achieve economies of scale, which will enable us to reduce our operating costs per acre.\nTable

ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is prohibited. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's combined consolidated financial statements.\n \u00b7 Repayment of $12,311,237 in outstanding debt; \nThese acquisitions are expected to close in the first half of 2016, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied or that the pending acquisitions will be consummated on the terms described herein, or at all.\nWe succeeded to the operations of our predecessor, FP Land LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( FP Land\u201d or our Predecessor\u201d) upon completion of the underwritten initial public offering of 3,800,000 shares of our common stock (the IPO\u201d) on April 16, 2014. Concurrently with the completion of the IPO, FP Land merged with and into the Operating Partnership, with the Operating Partnership surviving (the FP Land Merger\u201d). As a result of the FP Land Merger, the Operating Partnership acquired the 38 farms and three grain storage facilities owned indirectly by our Predecessor and assumed the ownership and operation of our Predecessor's business.\nThe market for farmland is dominated by buyers who are existing farm owners and operators. As a result of a decline in commodity prices in 2014 and 2015, farmland values in many agricultural markets have experienced modest declines recently after substantial increases over the prior several years. While demand for agricultural commodities has\nWe record revenue from the sale of harvested crops when the harvested crop has been delivered to a grain facility and\nWe account for all acquisitions in accordance with the business combinations standard. When we acquire farmland that was previously operated as a rental property, we evaluate whether a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of closing of the acquisition. If a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of acquisition, we account for the transaction as a business combination and charge the costs associated with the acquisition to acquisition and due diligence costs on the statement of operations as incurred. Otherwise, acquisitions with no lease in place or crops being produced at the time of acquisition are accounted for as asset acquisitions. When we acquire farmland in a sale-lease back transaction with newly originated leases entered into with the seller, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition and capitalize the transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition.\nNet cash used for investing activities increased approximately $124,646,896 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the following:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCertain of our leases provide for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds, a percentage of harvested crops, or a fixed crop quantity at a fixed price. As of December 31, 2015, a majority of such leases provided for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds. Revenue under leases providing for a payment equal to a percentage of the harvested crop or a percentage of the gross farm proceeds is recognized upon notification from the grain facility that grain has been delivered in the our name or when the tenant has notified us of the total amount of gross farm proceeds.\n (2) On April 10, 2015, the Company issued 118,634 OP units (with a fair value of $1,372,595 as of the date of closing) as partial consideration for the acquisition of the Nebraska Battle Creek farms. \nIn connection with the issuance of the Preferred Units, beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we intend to further adjust FFO to reflect the fact that, until the holders of the Preferred Units convert their Preferred Units to common OP units, which may occur on or after March 2, 2026, their impact on the our cash flow will be fixed and certain, while their impact on shares outstanding will be uncertain. Therefore, we intend to adjust FFO by subtracting the amount of dividends payable on the Preferred Units, and exclude the Preferred Units in the calculation of common shares fully diluted.\nSubstantially all of the leases for our portfolio are structured in such a way that we are responsible for major maintenance, certain insurance and taxes (which are sometimes reimbursed to us by our tenants), while our tenant is responsible for minor maintenance, water usage and all of the additional input costs related to farming operations on the property, such as seed, fertilizer, labor and fuel. We expect that substantially all of the leases for farmland we acquire in the future will continue to be structured in a manner consistent with substantially all of our existing leases. As the owner of the land, we generally only bear costs related to major capital improvements permanently attached to the property, such as irrigation systems, drainage tile, grain storage facilities, permanent plantings or other physical structures customary for farms. In cases where capital expenditures are necessary, we typically seek to offset, over a period of multiple years, the costs of such capital expenditures by increasing rental rates. We also incur the costs associated with maintaining liability and casualty insurance.\nTotal rental income increased $9,577,220, or 241.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of the 55 acquisitions completed over the last two years. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio increased to $215 per acre from $179 per acre in 2014. This increase was the result of diversification of our portfolio to new markets.\n \u00b7 Completing 26 acquisitions in 2015 for aggregate cash consideration of $109,309,474, as compared to $126,250,011 in aggregate cash consideration for 29 acquisitions in 2014; \nLeases in place as of December 31, 2015 had terms ranging from one to five years. As of December 31, 2015 we had 17 leases with renewal options and three leases with rent escalations. The majority of our leases provide for a fixed cash rent payment. Tenant leases on acquired farms generally require the tenant to pay the Company rent for the entire initial year regardless of the date of acquisition, if the acquisition is closed prior to, or shortly after, planting of crops. If the acquisition is closed later in the year, we typically receive a partial rent payment or no rent payment at all.\n \u00b7 Real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs. Acquisition expenses are incurred for investment purposes and therefore, do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our leases, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. This exclusion also improves comparability of our results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. \nThe Operating Partnership leases certain of its farms to the TRS, which is subject to federal and state income taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis and for operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not they will be realized on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. There was no taxable income from the TRS for the year ended December 31, 2015, and at December 31, 2015, we did not have any deferred tax assets or liabilities.\n (5) The Justice farms are located in Beaufort, Currituck, Pamlico, Pasquotank and Perquimans counties, NC; Marlboro County, SC; and Chesapeake, VA. \nCash rental income for the same-property portfolio decreased to $2,615,718 for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2,634,525 for 2014, as a result of average annual rent for the same-property portfolio decreasing to $357 per acre in 2015 from $360 per acre in 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower crop share rent in 2015.\nTenant reimbursements increased $247,664 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, and property operating expenses increased $211,108 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Both of these increases are due to the fact that in 2013, all but two of our leases required the tenants to directly pay all expenses incurred during the lease term in connection with the leased farms, including property taxes and maintenance. In 2014, leases that formerly provided for tenant payment of property taxes, requireed the tenant to reimburse us for the amount we paid in 2015. We accrued the expected tenant reimbursements for the year ended December 31, 2014, which are expected to be paid in 2015. Additionally, the tenants on the Hudye farms were required to reimburse us $18,595 for the 2013 taxes payable in 2014.\nNet cash used for investing activities decreased $6,605,660 primarily as a result of the following:\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of improvements on our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\n \u00b7 Other contractual debt payments of $6,050,300 made in 2015, compared to $1,032,100 in contractual debt payments made during 2014; \n \u00b7 Fully diluted shares of common stock. In accordance with GAAP, shares of common stock used to calculate earnings per share are presented on a weighted average basis. Common shares on a fully diluted basis includes shares of common stock, OP units and unvested restricted stock outstanding at the end of the period on a share equivalent basis, because all shares are participating securities and thus share in the performance of the Company. \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe recognize interest income on notes receivable on an accrual basis over the life of the note. Direct origination costs are netted against loan origination fees and are amortized over the life of the note using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, as an adjustment to interest income which is included in operating revenue as a component of other income in the our Combined Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWhen a sale occurs, we recognize the associated gain when all consideration has been transferred, the sale has closed, and there is no material continuing involvement. If a sale is expected to generate a loss, we first assess it through the impairment evaluation process-see \u2018\u2018Impairment of Real Estate Assets'' below.\nThe Bridge Loan matures on April 29, 2016, subject to three one-month extensions at the Bridge Borrower's option, and is secured by first lien mortgages on the Forsythe farms. Interest on the Bridge Loan is payable in cash monthly and\n \u00b7 Cash received from the sale of an easements and right of way totaling $144,020 made in 2014; \nConditions in Our Existing Markets\n \u00b7 Payments of $780,917 in offering costs made during 2015, as compared to $2,255,090 in payments during 2014; \n \u00b7 Repurchase and retire of $20,932 of common stock during 2015. \nNM = Not Meaningful\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur revenues are generated from renting farmland to operators of farming businesses. Our leases have terms ranging from one to five years. Although the majority of our leases do not provide the tenant with a contractual right to renew the lease upon its expiration, we believe it is customary to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to renew the lease, subject to any increase in the rental rate that we may establish. If the tenant elects not to renew the lease at the end of the lease term, the land will be offered to a new tenant.\nIn addition to utilizing current and any future available borrowings, we entered into equity distribution agreements on September 15, 2015, under which we may issue and sell from time to time, through the sales agents, shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $25,000,000. This at-the-market\u201d equity offering program is intended to provide additional financing alternatives in the capital markets and we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering, if any, for future farmland acquisitions in accordance with our investment strategy and for general corporate purposes, which may also include originating loans to farmers under our recently announced loan program. We only intend to utilize the equity offering should the market price of our common stock reach levels which are deemed appropriate.\nIn connection with the IPO and the related formation transactions, on April 16, 2014, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and First Midwest Bank, as lender, entered into the Amended and Restated Business Loan Agreement, as amended on February 24, 2015, July 24, 2015 and on March 6, 2016 (the FMW Loan Agreement\u201d), which provided for loans in the initial aggregate principal amount of approximately $30,780,000 (together, the First Midwest Loan\u201d). The First Midwest Loan is secured by first mortgages and assignments of rents encumbering 24 of our farms and two of our grain storage facilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had $26,650,000 outstanding under the First Midwest Loan.\nAcquisitions Completed to date in 2016\nWe are party to the Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2015 and subsequently amended (the Bond Purchase Agreement\u201d), with Farmer Mac and the Purchaser, regarding a secured bond purchase facility that as of December 31, 2015 has a maximum borrowing capacity of $165 million. Pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, the Operating Partnership may, from time to time, issue one or more bonds to the Purchaser that will be secured by pools of mortgage loans, which will, in turn, be secured by first liens on agricultural real estate owned by us. The mortgage loans may have effective loan-to-value ratios of up to 60%, after giving effect to the overcollateralization obligations described below. Prepayment of each bond issuance is not permitted unless otherwise agreed upon by all parties to the Bond Purchase Agreement.\nUpon acquisition of real estate, we allocate the purchase price of the real estate based upon the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, which historically have consisted of land, drainage improvements, irrigation improvements, groundwater, permanent plantings (bushes, shrubs, vines, perennials) and grain facilities and may also consist of intangible assets including in-place leases, above market and below market leases and tenant relationships. We allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of acquired real estate by valuing the land as if it were unimproved. We value improvements, including permanent plantings and grain facilities, at replacement cost as new adjusted for depreciation.\n \u00b7 Debt prepayments of $3,078,000 on the First Midwest bank debt during 2015, as compared to $11,279,137 in 2014; \n\nOn February 29, 2016, we closed on a $53,000,000 bridge term loan (the Bridge Loan\u201d), with the proceeds used to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the Forsythe Farm acquisition. The term note has a maturity of two months, with three one-month extension options, subject to the payment of a 1% extension fee at each extension, and has an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 3%.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $23,514,296 of cash and cash equivalents compared to $33,736,166 at December 31, 2014.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland, make other investments and certain long-term capital expenditures, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, and make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including future equity issuances (including issuances of OP units), net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d). ASU 2015-03 requires the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred charge asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-03 as of June 30, 2015. All periods presented have been retroactively adjusted.\nThe Guaranty contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including: (i) a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 60%; (ii) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter; (iii) a minimum tangible net worth; (iv) a general restriction on incurring additional indebtedness subject to certain exceptions, including indebtedness for property acquisitions of up to $6.0 million; (v) a restriction on investments in excess of $10.0 million in the aggregate without the prior written consent of the Lender subject to certain limited exceptions; and (vi) a restriction on modifying terms of the Preferred Units (as defined below).\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of AFFO share information to basic weighted average common shares outstanding, the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent, for the periods indicated below (unaudited):\nThe First Midwest Loan has a maturity date of June 4, 2016, with respect to $26,000,000 of the currently outstanding principal of the loan, and the remaining balance matures on June 28, 2016. The loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 2.59%, but in any event not less than a rate per annum of 2.80%, and requires us to make quarterly interest payments on the 30th day of each calendar quarter and a principal payment of $26,000,000 on June 16, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated With Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting ( ASU 2015-15\u201d), which clarified that the SEC would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. ASU 2015-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. We have assessed the impact of ASU 2015-15 and it does not have a material effect on our combined consolidated financial statements or financial covenants.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated below (unaudited):\nHarvested crop inventory includes costs accumulated during both the growing and harvesting phases and is stated at the lower of those costs or the estimated net realizable value, which is the market price, based upon the nearest market in the geographic region, less any cost of disposition. Cost of disposition includes broker's commissions, freight and other marketing costs.\nThe Bridge Loan Agreement includes certain customary events of default, including a cross-default provision related to other outstanding indebtedness of the Company and the Operating Partnership, the occurrence of any of which, after any applicable cure period, would permit the Bridge Lender, among other things, to accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Loan and to exercise its remedies with respect to the pledged collateral, including foreclosure and sale of the Forsythe farms.\nWe are currently negotiating leases on 3,158 acres, have 15,879 acres which have lease payments based on a percentage of farming revenues or crops and have 641 acres leased to our taxable REIT subsidiary, which are not included in the table above. We expect market rents in the coming year to be consistent with expiring rents.\nUnder the FMW Loan Agreement, we are subject to ongoing compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio of 0.60 to 1.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.00. Each covenant is measured annually as of December 31st of each year. Additionally, we are required to maintain a minimum cash account balance of $500,000 during the term of the agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2015.\nIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which amends or supersedes the scope and consolidation guidance under existing GAAP. The new standard changes the way a reporting entity evaluates whether (a) limited partnerships and similar entities should be consolidated, (b) fees paid to decision makers or service providers are variable interests in a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d), and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties require the reporting entity to consolidate the VIE. ASU 2015-02 also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We intend to adopt this pronouncement during the three months ending March 31, 2016, and do not anticipate a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows from adopting this standard.\nFinancing Activity\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nOur estimates of land value are made using a comparable sales analysis. Factors considered by us in our analysis of land value include soil types and water availability and the sales prices of comparable farms. Our estimates of groundwater value are made using historical information obtained regarding the applicable aquifer. Factors considered by us in our analysis of groundwater value are related to the location of the aquifer and whether or not the aquifer is a depletable resource or a replenishing resource. If the aquifer is a replenishing resource, no value is allocated to the groundwater. We include an estimate of property taxes in the purchase price allocation of acquisitions to account for the expected liability that was assumed.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased approximately $1,758,962, primarily as a result of the following:\n \u00b7 Funding of $2,830,000 in notes receivable, which was offset by $23,003 of net origination fees received. \n (1) On March 2, 2015 the transaction closed with an estimated purchase price consisting of (a) $50.0 million in cash, (b) an aggregate of 2,608,695 OP units valued at $11.50 per OP unit, or $30.0 million in the aggregate, and (c) 117,000 Preferred Units with an aggregate value of $117.0 million. \nInflation\nFarmer Mac Facility\nfarmland, and our ability to increase or maintain rental revenues while controlling expenses. Although farmland prices may show a decline from time to time, we believe that any reduction in U.S. farmland values overall is likely to be short-lived as global demand for food and agricultural commodities typically exceeds global supply. In addition, although prices for many crops experienced significant declines in 2014 and 2015, we do not believe that such declines represent a trend that will continue over the long term. Rather, we believe that long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time.\nBecause the leases for a majority of the properties in our portfolio require payment of at least 50% of the annual rent in advance of each spring planting season, we receive a significant portion of our cash rental payments in the first calendar quarter of each year, although we recognize rental revenue from these leases on a pro rata basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe perform an annual review for any uncertain tax positions and, if necessary, will record future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements. An uncertain tax position is defined as a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is not based on clear and unambiguous tax law and which is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. At December 31, 2015 we did not identify any uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company and the Operating Partnership are parties to a bond purchase agreement (the Bond Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ( Farmer Mac\u201d) and Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities Corporation (the Purchaser\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Farmer Mac, as bond purchaser, regarding a secured note purchase facility (as amended, the Farmer Mac Facility\u201d) that had a maximum borrowing capacity of $165.0 million at December 31, 2015, with $160.6 million outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further details.\nOther revenues totaled $73,169 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to no other revenues realized in 2014. The other revenues recognized during 2015 were generated on interest and amortization of net loan fees, primarily from the FPI Loan Program, launched in August 2015. An initial $1,800,000 mortgage note receivable was issued in August 2015, and a $980,000 mortgage note was issued to a separate party in November 2015. See - Recent Developments-FPI Loan Program.\u201d\nLegal and accounting expenses decreased $16,755 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. In 2014, the Company incurred $537,533 in audit and accounting fees and $77,805 in legal fees, as a result of becoming a public company. In 2013, the Company incurred $620,000 related to the preparation of financial statements for use in connection with the IPO.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments ( ASU 2015-16\u201d), pertaining to entities that have reported provisional amounts for items in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized. The guidance requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Any adjustments should be calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-16 for the quarterly period ending December 31, 2015.\nWe expect that global demand for food, driven primarily by significant increases in the global population and GDP per capita, will continue to be the key driver of farmland values. We further expect that global demand for most crops will continue to grow to keep pace with global population growth, which we anticipate will lead to either higher prices and/or higher yields and, therefore, higher rental rates on our farmland, as well as sustained growth in farmland values over the long-term. We also believe that growth in global GDP per capita, particularly in developing nations, will contribute significantly to increasing demand for primary crops. As global GDP per capita increases, the composition of daily caloric intake is expected to shift away from the direct consumption of primary crops toward animal-based proteins, which is expected to result in increased demand for primary crops as feed for livestock. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization ( UN FAO\u201d), these factors are expected to require more than one billion additional tons of global annual grain production by 2050, a 45.5% increase from 2005-2007 levels and more than two times the 475 million tons of grain produced in the United States in 2014. Furthermore, we believe that, as GDP per capita grows, a significant portion of additional household income is allocated to food and that once individuals increase consumption of, and spending on, higher quality food, they will strongly resist returning to their former dietary habits, resulting in greater inelasticity in the demand for food. As a result, we believe that, as global demand for food increases, rental rates on our farmland and the value of our farmland will increase over the long-term. Global demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels such as ethanol and soy diesel also could impact the prices of corn and soybeans, which, in the long-term, could impact our rental revenues and our results of operations. However, the success of our business strategy is not dependent on growth in demand for biofuels and we do not believe that demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels will materially impact our results of operations or the value of our farmland, primarily because we believe that growth in global population and GDP per capita will be more significant drivers of global demand for primary crops over the long-term.\n \u00b7 Increase of $923,975 in employee compensation paid; \nmeasure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\n \u00b7 Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation is a non-cash expense and therefore, does not correlate with the ongoing operations. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO improves comparability of our results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. \n \u00b7 Real estate related acquisition audit fees. A portion of the audit fees we incur is directly related to acquisitions, and varies with the number and complexity of the acquisitions we evaluate and complete in a given period. As such, these costs do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our current acquisition strategy, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. This exclusion also improves comparability of our results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. \nUsing information available at the time of acquisition, we allocate the total consideration to tangible assets and liabilities and identified intangible assets and liabilities. We may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocations after obtaining more information about asset valuations and liabilities assumed.\n\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) and Adjusted EBITDA\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOur real estate consists of land, groundwater and improvements made to the land consisting of grain facilities, irrigation improvements, other assets and drainage improvements. We record real estate at cost and capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. We expense costs of repairs and maintenance as such costs are incurred. We begin depreciating assets when the asset is ready for its intended use. We compute depreciation and depletion for assets classified as improvements using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 10-40 years for grain facilities, 2-40 years for irrigation improvements, 27-65 for drainage improvements, 3-50 years for groundwater, 23 years for permanent plantings, and 5-40 years for other assets acquired. We periodically evaluate the estimated useful lives for groundwater based on current state water regulations and depletion levels of the aquifers.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nAs a REIT, for income tax purposes we are permitted to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders, thereby eliminating the U.S. federal taxation of income represented by such distributions at the Company level, provided certain requirements are met. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.\n results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. There were no indirect offering costs in periods prior to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. \nOn February 29, 2016, the Bridge Borrower entered into the Bridge Loan Agreement with the Bridge Lender that provides for a loan of $53.0 million, the proceeds of which were used primarily to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition of the Forsythe farms, which was completed on March 2, 2016. The Company is currently in negotiations with certain lenders to provide long-term secured debt financing to repay the Bridge Loan at or prior to its maturity, but the Company can provide no assurances that it will be able to enter into such financing on favorable terms or at all.\nWe are an internally managed real estate company that owns and seeks to acquire high-quality farmland located in agricultural markets throughout North America. As of the date of this Annual Report, we own or have under contract 258 farms with an aggregate of 108,163 acres (including 5 farms totaling 8,591 acres under contract) in Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. As of the date of this Annual Report, the majority of the acres in our portfolio are used to grow primary crops, such as corn, soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton, while some of our farms produce specialty crops, such as blueberries, vegetables and edible beans. However, over the long term, we expect that our farmland portfolio will be comprised of approximately 80% primary crop farmland and 20% specialty crop farmland, which we believe will give investors exposure to the increasing global food demand trend in the face of growing scarcity of high quality farmland and will reflect the approximate breakdown of U.S. agricultural output between primary crops and animal protein (whose production relies principally on primary crops as feed), on one hand, and specialty crops, on the other. In addition, in August 2015, the Company announced the launch of the FPI Loan Program, an agricultural lending product aimed at farmers, as a complement to the Company's primary business of acquiring and owning farmland and leasing it to farmers. Under the FPI Loan Program, we intend to make loans to third-party farmers (both tenant and non-tenant) to provide partial financing for working capital requirements and operational farming activities, farming infrastructure projects, and for other farming and agricultural real estate related purposes.\naccrues at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum. In addition, under the Bridge Loan Agreement, the Bridge Borrower paid an origination fee of 4.00% of the loan amount and is required to pay an extension fee of 1.00% of the loan amount for each one-month extension and a default fee of 2.00% of the loan amount if the Bridge Loan is not repaid at maturity. The Bridge Borrower may prepay the Bridge Loan, subject to paying the Lender any LIBOR brokerage costs.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nThe balance of the First Midwest Loan may be prepaid by us in whole or in part without any prepayment penalties. The First Midwest Loan contains customary events of default, including defaults in the payment of principal or interest, defaults in compliance with the covenants contained in the documents evidencing the loans, defaults in payments under any other documents covering any part of the properties, and bankruptcy or other insolvency events.\n \u00b7 Borrowings from mortgage notes payable of $82,475,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to borrowings of $81,100,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2014; \nThe principal factors affecting our operating results and the value of our farmland include global demand for food relative to the global supply of food, farmland fundamentals and economic conditions in the markets in which we own\nOn July 21, 2015, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 3,360,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $11.00 and generated gross proceeds of approximately $37.0 million. The aggregate net proceeds to the Company, after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $34.6 million.\nRental income for the same-property portfolio increased $265,554, or 11.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of average annual cash rent for the same-property portfolio increasing to $365 per acre for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $327 per acre in 2013.\nOn September 15, 2015, the Company filed a prospectus supplement under which it may sell shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $25,000,000 through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program. The offering is made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 14, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, no shares had been issued under the program.\nInterest expense increased by $3,244,272 or 236.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of an increase in our average outstanding borrowings, which were $159,233,978 during the year December 31, 2015 and $44,426,322 for 2014. Our weighted average cost of borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 2.80% and 2.76%, respectively. We also recognized additional interest expense of $225,134 and $138,369 during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred loan fees. These increases were partially offset by the amortization of a premium on our debt of $69,989 during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn addition, on February 29, 2016, we closed on the $53,000,000 Bridge Loan, which has a maturity date of April 29, 2016, with three one-month extension options, subject to the payment of a 1% extension fee at each extension.\ntitle has transferred. Harvested crops delivered under marketing contracts are recorded using the fixed price of the marketing contract at the time of delivery to a grain facility. Harvested crops delivered without a marketing contract are recorded using the market price at the date the harvested crop is delivered to the grain facility and title has transferred.\n \u00b7 Proceeds from an equity offering of $35,112,000 during 2015, compared to total proceeds of $93,620,980 from an initial public offering and subsequent equity offering during 2014; \nThe leases for the majority of the properties in our portfolio provide that tenants must pay us at least 50% (and often 100%) of the annual rent in advance of each spring planting season. As a result, we collect a significant portion of total annual rents in the first calendar quarter of each year. We believe our use of leases pursuant to which at least 50% of the\nAcross our entire portfolio, we are experiencing flat to modestly declining rent rates in connection with lease renewals. In order to offer our tenants a better match between cash inflows and outflows, in 2016 a higher portion than in 2015 of our fixed cash leases provides for payment of 50% of a year's rent after harvest. We believe quality farmland in the United States has a near-zero vacancy rate as a result of the supply and demand fundamentals discussed above. We believe rental rates for farmland are a function of farmland operators' view of the long-term profitability of farmland, and that many farm operators will continue to compete for farmland even during periods of decreased profitability due to the scarcity of farmland available to rent. In particular, we believe that due to the relatively high fixed costs associated with farming operations (including equipment, labor and knowledge), many farm operators in some circumstances will rent additional acres of farmland when it becomes available in order to allocate their fixed costs over more acres. Furthermore, because it is generally customary in the farming industry to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to re-lease the land at the end of each lease term, we believe that many farm operators will rent additional land that becomes available in order to control the ability to farm that land in future periods when profitability is higher. As a result, in our experience, many farm operators will aggressively pursue rental opportunities in close proximity to their existing operations when they arise, even when the farmer anticipates lower current returns or short-term losses. In addition, because many farmers both own farmland and rent additional farmland from other landowners, we believe that many farmers will choose to subsidize losses on rented land during periods of lower profitability with relatively higher profits generated by land that they own and that has comparatively lower fixed costs. Due to the short term nature of most of our leases, we believe that a recovery of crop prices and farm profitability will be reflected relatively rapidly in our revenues via increases in rent rates.\nGlobal supply of agricultural commodities is driven by two primary factors, the number of tillable acres available for crop production and the productivity of the acres being farmed. Although the amount of global cropland in use has gradually increased over time, growth has plateaued over the last 20 years. Cropland area continues to increase in developing countries, but after accounting for expected continuing cropland loss, the UN FAO projects only 171 million acres will be added from 2005-2007 to 2050, a 4.3% increase. In comparison, world population is expected to grow over the same period to 9.7 billion, a nearly 40% increase. While we expect growth in the global supply of arable land, we also expect that landowners will only put that land into production if increases in commodity prices and the value of farmland cause landowners to benefit economically from using the land for farming rather than alternative uses. We also believe that decreases in the amount of arable land in the United States and globally as a result of increasing urbanization will partially offset the impact of additional supply of farmland. The global supply of food is also impacted by the productivity per acre of tillable land. Historically, productivity gains (measured by average crop yields) have been driven by advances in seed technology, farm equipment, irrigation techniques and chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, we expect the increasing shortage of water in many irrigated growing regions in the United States and other growing regions around the globe, often as a result of new water restrictions imposed by laws or regulations, to lead to decreased productivity growth on many acres and, in some cases, cause yields to decline on those acres.\n \u00b7 $43,300,000 of net proceeds from the Follow-on Offering, which was completed on July 30, 2014; \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nCertain of our leases provide for minimum cash rent plus a bonus based on gross farm proceeds. Revenue under this type of lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term based on the minimum cash rent. Bonus rent is recognized upon notification from the tenant of the gross farm proceeds for the year.\nIn connection with the Term Loan, on February 29, 2016, the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into a guaranty (the Guaranty\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed unconditionally to guarantee all of the Bridge Borrower's obligations under the Bridge Loan.\nWe elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe do not, however, believe that FFO is the only measure of the sustainability of our operating performance. Changes in GAAP accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in FFO that do not correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance. Therefore, in addition to FFO, we present AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company's operational performance than FFO. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. Even AFFO, however, does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts, especially in connection with full-year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms. Management considers AFFO per share, fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to GAAP earnings per share. AFFO per share, fully diluted provides additional insight into how our operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted and, accordingly, our AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted may not always be comparable to AFFO and AFFO per share amounts calculated by other REITs. AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to net income (loss) earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.\nOur exposure to short-term crop price fluctuations, related to farming operations conducted by our TRS, is generally limited by current marketing contracts or other sales arrangements, which the Company may enter into throughout the growing season, and by the availability of grain storage capacity, which gives us the ability to delay the delivery of crops until after seasonal price declines.\n \u00b7 Increase of $601,251 on property other taxes; \n \u00b7 Decrease in cash paid for interest of $368,405, during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of the timing of interest payments on the current indebtedness and the payoff of $12,300,000 of outstanding indebtedness in 2014. \nWe further adjust EBITDA for certain additional items such as crop year adjusted revenue, stock based compensation, indirect equity offering costs, real estate acquisition related audit fees and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs (for a full discussion of these adjustments see AFFO adjustments discussed above) that we consider necessary to understand our operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance.\nThe purchase price is allocated to in-place lease values and tenant relationships, if they are acquired, based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. The value of in-place lease intangibles and tenant relationships will be included as components of deferred leasing intangibles, and will be amortized over the remaining lease term (and expected renewal periods of the respective leases for tenant relationships) as amortization expense. If a tenant terminates its lease prior to its stated expiration, any unamortized amounts relating to that lease, including (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place lease values, and (iii) tenant relationships, would be recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate. We capitalize acquisition costs and due diligence costs if the asset is expected to qualify as an asset acquisition. If the asset acquisition is abandoned, the capitalized asset acquisition costs will be expensed to acquisition and due diligence costs in the period of abandonment.\nAcquisition and due diligence costs increased $193,039 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of $111,377 in costs directly related to the six business combinations completed in 2014, $70,377 in costs directly related to asset acquisitions that were abandoned and due diligence efforts on other prospective business combinations.\nFarm leases are often short-term in nature. As of December 31, 2015 our portfolio had the following lease expirations as a percentage of approximate acres leased and annualized minimum cash rents:\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \u00b7 Increase in employee compensation paid of $648,000; \nOn August 24, 2015, the Company entered into a promissory note agreement with a third-party non-tenant farmer to provide up to $2,000,000 in the form of a mortgage note. The note is collateralized by a first mortgage on farm real estate. Currently, $1,800,000 has been funded with the remaining $200,000 of funding subject to the satisfaction of customary lending requirements, including finalization and issuance of the title research and appraisal report. The note has a fixed interest rate and all principal and accrued interest due at maturity, which was initially January 15, 2016 but has been extended by one year with the first year's interest received at the time of the extension.\nOur rental income for 2015 was impacted by the 29 acquisitions that took place in 2014, primarily in the fourth quarter, in addition to the 26 acquisitions that took place throughout 2015. To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we have separately discussed the rental income for the same-property portfolio, which includes only properties owned and operated for the entirety of both periods presented. The same-property portfolio for the periods presented includes the 38 farms and three grain storage facilities contributed to us by our Predecessor at the time of the IPO.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in the notes to the historical combined consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing. We have set forth below those accounting policies that we believe require material subjective or complex judgments and have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis, based on information that is then available to us, our experience and various matters that we believe are reasonable and appropriate for consideration under the circumstances.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offering Program\nThe Bond Purchase Agreement and the Pledge Agreement include customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which, after any applicable cure period, would permit the Purchaser and Farmer Mac to, among other things, accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility and to exercise its remedies with respect to the pledged collateral, including foreclosure and sale of the agricultural real estate underlying the pledged mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2015, we had $160,575,000 outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nDemand\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $33,736,166 of cash and cash equivalents compared to $17,805 at December 31, 2013.\nOther inventory, such as fertilizer and pesticides, is valued at the lower of cost or market.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014 we had 16,155,971 and 9,676,755 shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, respectively.\nIn August 2015, the Company introduced the FPI Loan Program, an agricultural lending product aimed at farmers as a complement to the Company's current business of acquiring and owning farmland and leasing it to farmers. Under the FPI Loan Program, the Company makes loans to third-party farmers (both tenant and non-tenant) to provide partial financing for working capital requirements and operational farming activities, farming infrastructure projects, and for other farming and agricultural real estate related projects. These loans are collateralized by farm real estate and are to be in principal amounts of $500,000 or more at fixed interest rates with maturities of up to three years. The Company expects the borrower to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements based on farming operations and access to other forms of capital, as permitted. Notes receivable are stated at their unpaid principal balance, and include unamortized direct origination costs and accrued interest through the reporting date, less any allowance for losses and unearned borrower paid points.\nResults of Operations\n \u00b7 Increase in acquisition and due diligence costs of $193,039; \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $5,912,190, primarily as a result of the following:\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013\n \u00b7 Dividend and distribution payments of $5,944,130 to common stockholders and OP unitholders made in 2015, compared to dividends payments and net distributions to members of $2,713,376 during 2014; and \nRental income includes rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its lease. Minimum rents pursuant to leases are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including renewal options in the case of below market leases. Deferred revenue includes the cumulative difference between the rental revenue recorded on a straight-line basis and the cash rent received from tenants in accordance with the lease terms. Acquired below market leases are included in deferred revenue on the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets, which are amortized into rental income over the life of the respective leases, plus the terms of the below market renewal options, if any.\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015:\nThe value of a crop is affected by many factors that can differ on a yearly basis. Weather conditions and crop disease in major crop production regions worldwide creates a significant risk of price volatility, which may either increase or decrease the value of the crops that our tenants produce each year. Other material factors adding to the volatility of crop prices are changes in government regulations and policy, fluctuations in global prosperity, fluctuations in foreign trade and export markets, and eruptions of military conflicts or civil unrest. Prices for many annual crops, particularly corn, experienced significant declines in 2014 and 2015, but we do not believe that such declines represent a trend that will continue over the long term. Rather, we believe that those declines in prices for annual crops represented a combination of correction to historical norms (adjusted for inflation) and high yields induced by unusually favorable weather patterns, and that continued long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time. Although annual rental payments under the majority of our leases are not based expressly on the\nSeasonality\nTotal rental income increased approximately $1,620,436, or 69.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily resulting from the completion of 29 acquisitions during 2014, 19 of which were completed in December. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio decreased to $179 per acre from $326 per acre in 2013. The decrease in average annual cash rent per acre is a result of an emphasis of our acquisition activity on farmland characterized by lower price and rent per acre than the pre-existing portfolio. As a result of completing 19 acquisitions in December 2014, we did not have leases in place for all properties and did not receive rental income on the majority of the properties acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nExpenses\nLegal and accounting expenses increased $475,001, or 77.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of being a public company for a full year with the Company going public in April 2014. Also contributing to the increase in legal and accounting expenses were general corporate matters and the growth of our portfolio.\n\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets\n (3) On April 10, 2015, the Company issued 119,953 OP units (with a fair value of $1,387,856 as of the date of closing) as partial consideration for the acquisition of the Northeast Nebraska farms. \nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results of operations and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplemental measure of our performance.\nOn November 16, 2015, the Company entered into a promissory note agreement with a tenant farmer to provide $980,000 in the form of a mortgage note. The note has a fixed annual interest rate with principal and all accrued interest due at maturity on October 30, 2017. The note is collateralized by a first mortgage on farm real estate.\nIn connection with the FMW Loan Agreement, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership unconditionally agreed to guarantee all of the obligations of the Operating Partnership under the FMW Loan Agreement. In addition, Paul A. Pittman, our Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jesse J. Hough, our\nInventory of our TRS\nSources and Uses of Cash\n\nNM = Not Meaningful\n \u00b7 An increase in cash paid for interest of $2,949,027 due to an increase in average outstanding indebtedness of approximately $115,500,000, year-to-year. \n \u00b7 As a result of the completion of the formation transactions, the Company had a reduction in net distributions to non-controlling interest in operating partnership or net distributions to members of $5,181,212; and \n (4) On June 2, 2015, the Company issued 824,398 shares of common stock and 1,993,709 OP units, of which 883,724 units are redeemable for cash or at the Company's option into shares of common stock on a one for one basis up to a maximum of 1,109,985 shares (with an aggregate fair value of $30,914,634, as of the date of closing), as partial consideration for the acquisition of the Justice farms. See Note 9-Stockholders Equity and Non-controlling Interests\u201d. \nProperty operating expenses increased $855,015, or 343.9%, for the 2015 year, as compared to the prior year, of which $243,416 is attributable to acquired properties during 2015. The remaining increase in property operating expenses is primarily related to increases in property insurance of $111,694, property taxes of $224,062, state franchise taxes of $113,137, and repairs of $53,650. Also increasing during the year were travel costs related to property visits on newly acquired properties of $42,987 and $48,076 expensed for legal costs related to tenant issues.\n (2) The Forsythe farms are located in Edgar, Clark, Coles, Crawford, Douglas, Vermilion & Cumberland counties, Illinois. \nDepreciation and depletion expense increased $564,733, or 171.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is the result of acquiring $7,468,127 in depreciable assets in the last quarter of 2014, $7,000,392 in depreciable assets throughout 2015 and investing $5,637,733 in property improvements on acquired property during 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n (1) On March 13, 2015, the Company issued 63,581 shares of common stock (with a fair value of $712,743 as of the date of closing) as partial consideration for the acquisition of the Timmerman farm. \nRevenue Recognition\n \u00b7 Receipt of $5,310,267 in cash rents for the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $1,364,737 was included in deferred revenue at year end, as compared to $1,899,192 in cash rents for the year ended December 31, 2013; \n \u00b7 Additional operating costs of $704,682 directly related to being a public company; and \nFPI Loan Program\n \u00b7 Indirect offering costs. Indirect offering costs are fees for services incurred by the Company to grow and maintain an active institutional investor presence. As we continue to acquire more farms and farmland, our ability to access capital through the equity markets will remain a critical component of our growth strategy. As of September 30, 2015, we began excluding indirect offering costs from AFFO as we believe it improves comparability of our \nLeases in place in 2014 that provide for tenant payment of property taxes required the tenant to reimburse us for the tax amount we paid in 2015 for the 2014 taxable year. Due to changes in terms of lease renewals, as well as of certain outstanding leases, tenant reimbursements decreased $112,367, or 45.4%, in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nAll of the leases for the farmland in our portfolio have one- to five-year terms, pursuant to which each tenant is responsible for substantially all of the operating expenses related to the property, including taxes, maintenance, water usage and insurance. As a result, we believe that the effect on us of inflationary increases in operating expenses may be offset in part by the operating expenses that are passed through to our tenants and by contractual rent increases because our leases will be renegotiated every one to five years. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\n\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net income (loss) to FFO, AFFO and net income available to common stockholders per share to AFFO per share, fully diluted, the most directly comparable GAAP equivalents, respectively, for the periods indicated below (unaudited):\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \nThe Farmer Mac Facility includes a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including: a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 60%; a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.00, beginning after the second quarter of 2015; and a minimum tangible net worth. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2015. On August 3, 2015, we amended the Bond Purchase Agreement in order to calculate the fixed charge coverage ratio using our Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement) rather than our EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement).\nOther income decreased by $45,654, or 31.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. During both periods other income was recognized on the sale of easements and right-of-way.\n \u00b7 Investment of $7,574,180 for real estate improvements during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $46,300 in 2014; and \nWhen we acquire a property in a business combination, we evaluate such acquisition for any related deferred tax assets or liabilities and determine if a deferred tax asset or liability should be recorded in conjunction with the purchase price allocation. If a built-in gain is acquired, we evaluate the required holding period (generally 5-10 years) and determine if we have the ability and intent to hold the underlying assets for the necessary holding period. If we have the ability to hold the underlying assets for the required holding period, no deferred tax liability will be recorded with respect to the built-in gain.\n2015 Completed Acquisitions\nOn April 1, 2015, the TRS and Hough Farms entered into a custom farming arrangement, pursuant to which Hough Farms will perform custom farming on 563 acres. Additionally, the TRS plans to operate a volume purchasing program for participating tenants by working with suppliers to pool tenant purchasing abilities and create cost savings through bulk orders. This volume purchasing program is currently operated by the Company on a limited trial basis.\n\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; \n \u00b7 Increase in costs as a result of becoming a public company of $839,691; \nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Adjusted Funds from Operations ( AFFO\u201d)\nInterest Rates\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08\u201d). Under this revised guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations, such as a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business or a major equity method investment, will be presented as discontinued operations. The standard requires prospective application and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014 with early adoption permitted. The early adoption provision excludes components of an entity that were sold or classified as held for sale prior to the adoption of the standard. We elected to early adopt this standard effective January 1, 2014. Because there were no dispositions for the year ended December 31, 2014 and guidance is applied prospectively, there was no impact to our statements of operations or financial position.\n \u00b7 Issuance five bonds totaling $81,100,100 under the Farmer Mac Facility. \nProperties under Contract\nour business operating performance because it includes non-cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand our business operating performance. Therefore, in addition to EBITDA, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth in the table below.\nWe evaluate our tangible and identifiable intangible real estate assets for impairment indicators whenever events such as declines in a property's operating performance, deteriorating market conditions, or environmental or legal concerns bring recoverability of the carrying value of one or more assets into question. If such events are present, we project the total undiscounted cash flows of the asset, including proceeds from disposition, and compare it to the net book value of the asset. If this evaluation indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in earnings equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There have been no impairments recognized on real estate assets in the accompanying financial statements.\nOverview and Background\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased approximately $156,631,445 primarily as a result of the following:\nReal Estate\nDuring 2015, we completed 26 acquisitions, bringing the total to 56 acquisitions since the IPO. The 2015 acquisitions are described in further detail below. The 2015 acquisitions expanded our presence to four new states, bringing our total presence to twelve states. We also started acquiring permanent specialty crop farms.\nCrop Prices\nTenant reimbursements include reimbursements for real estate taxes that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its lease. When leases require that the tenant reimburse us for property taxes paid by us, the reimbursement is reflected as tenant reimbursement revenue on the statements of operations, as earned, and the related property tax as property operating expense, as incurred. When a lease requires that the tenant pay the taxing authority directly, we do not incur this cost. If and when it becomes probable that a tenant will not be able to bear the property-related costs, we will accrue the estimated expense.\nRecent Developments\nannual rent is payable in advance of each spring planting season mitigates the tenant credit risk associated with the variability of farming operations that could be adversely impacted by poor crop yields, weather conditions, mismanagement, undercapitalization or other factors affecting our tenants. Prior to acquiring farmland property, we take into consideration the competitiveness of the local farm-operator tenant environment in order to enhance our ability to quickly replace a tenant that is unwilling to renew a lease or is unable to pay a rent payment when it is due. Some of our leases provide for a reimbursement of the property taxes we pay. We expect that, going forward, a progressively smaller percentage of our leases will provide for such a reimbursement.\nOur exposure to short-term crop price declines is limited. The lease agreements with some of our tenants provide for a rent determined as a percentage of the farm's gross proceeds, but even in those cases our downside is generally limited by crop insurance, hedging, or a minimum cash rent. In addition, the impact of weaker crop prices is often offset by the higher crop yields that generally accompany lower crop prices.\nTotal consideration for acquisitions may include a combination of cash and equity securities. When equity securities are issued, we determine the fair value of the equity securities issued based on the number of shares of common stock and OP units issued multiplied by the stock price on the date of closing in the case of common stock and OP units, and on liquidation preference in the case of Preferred Units.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nInterest expense increased by $29,868, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of an increase in interest related to the Farmer Mac Facility of $238,933 and an increase in the amortization of deferred financing fees of $80,392, which was offset by interest savings of $268,545 as a result of repaying $12.2 million in outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2014, we had $81.1 million outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland and make other investments consistent with our investment strategy, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT and fund our operations. Our sources of funds primarily will be cash on hand, operating cash flows and borrowings from prospective lenders.\n \u00b7 Payments of $238,711 in financing fees made during 2015, as compared to $369,528 in payments during 2014; \n \u00b7 Receipt of $300,000 of refund related to certain of our mortgage notes payable during 2015; and \nNew or Revised Accounting Standards\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nContractual Obligations\nRental Revenues\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ended December 31, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay any outstanding borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and to OP unitholders, and other general business needs.\nWe were incorporated in Maryland on September 27, 2013, and we are the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, which is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed on September 27, 2013. All of our assets are held by, and our operations are primarily conducted through, the Operating Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. As of the date of this Annual Report we own 64% of the common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( OP units\u201d) and none of the Series A preferred units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( Preferred Units\u201d). See Note 9 to our combined consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Preferred Units.\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nGain on sale of easement was $144,020 for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, the Company entered into a transmission easement with a power company in Illinois for $144,020.\nWe expect that future changes in interest rates will impact our overall operating performance by, among other things, increasing our borrowing costs. While we may seek to manage our exposure to future changes in rates through interest rate swap agreements or interest rate caps, portions of our overall outstanding debt will likely remain at floating rates. In addition, a sustained material increase in interest rates may cause farmland prices to decline if the rise in real interest rates (which is defined as nominal interest rates minus the inflation rate) is not accompanied by rises in the general levels of inflation. However, our business model anticipates that the value of our farmland will increase, as it has in the past, at a rate that is equal to or greater than the rate of inflation, which may in part offset the impact of rising interest rates on the value of our farmland, but there can be no guarantee that this appreciation will occur to the extent that we anticipate or at all.\nOur rental income for the periods presented was impacted by 29 acquisitions made during the year ended December 31, 2014 and one acquisition made during the year ended December 31, 2013. To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we have separately discussed the rental income for the same-property portfolio, which includes only properties owned and operated for the entirety of both periods presented. The same-property portfolio for the periods presented includes only the original farms which were contributed at the IPO date.\nOur ability to incur additional debt will depend on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets, borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders and the conditions of debt markets. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will depend on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOver the next twelve months, $84,750,000 of our borrowings will mature. To satisfy our maturing debt obligations, we intend to utilize a combination of our expected cash flow from operations, and proceeds from debt refinancings from prospective lenders and potential equity issuances. Any cash that we use to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations will\nconsultant, unconditionally agreed to jointly and severally guarantee $11,000,000 of the Operating Partnership's obligations under the FMW Loan Agreement. On February 24, 2015, we amended the FMW Loan Agreement to revise the financial covenants. On March 6, 2016, we amended the FMW Loan Agreement to extend its maturity by three months, to June 4, 2016, with respect to $26,000,000 of the currently outstanding principal.\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate related depreciation, depletion and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management presents FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance\n \u00b7 Receipt of $16,353,157 in cash rents for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to receiving $5,310,267 in cash rents in the same period of 2014; \nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) (\"ASU 2015-11\"). The amendments require that an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated sales price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn connection with the Bond Purchase Agreement, we and the Operating Partnership are also party to the Amended and Restated Pledge and Security agreement, dated as of March 1, 2015 (the Pledge Agreement\u201d) in favor of the Purchaser and Farmer Mac, pursuant to which we and the Operating Partnership agreed to pledge, as collateral for the Farmer Mac Facility, all of their respective right, title and interest in (i) mortgage loans with a value at least equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding bond held by the Purchaser and (ii) such additional collateral as necessary to have total collateral with a value at least equal to 110% of the outstanding notes held by the Purchaser. In addition, we agreed to guarantee the full performance of the Operating Partnership's duties and obligations under the Pledge Agreement.\n \u00b7 Acquiring 49 farms in 2014 for aggregate consideration of $126,250,000. \n \u00b7 Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. \nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations and Farmland Values\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n", "item_7_text": "Lease Expirations\nOn February 29, 2016, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership (together, the Bridge Borrower\u201d) entered into a term loan agreement (the Bridge Loan Agreement\u201d) with MSD FPI Partners, LLC, an affiliate of MSD Partners, L.P. (the Bridge Lender\u201d), that provides for a loan of $53.0 million (the Bridge Loan\u201d), the proceeds of which were used primarily to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition of the Forsythe farms, which was completed on March 2, 2016. On March 14, 2016, we received from MetLife Agricultural Investments ( MetLife\u201d) commitments in the total aggregate amount of $127 million for mortgage loans secured by farmland. MetLife's loan commitments are subject to customary conditions, and expire between May 24, 2016 and June 14, 2016. We intend to use proceeds from these loans to refinance existing debt, to acquire new properties, and for general corporate purposes. We can provide no assurances that we will enter into a loan with MetLife on the terms we currently anticipate, or at all.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is expected to impact our consolidated financial statements as the we have an operating lease arrangement for which we are the lessee. ASC 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840 Leases. The standard is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance.\n\nConsolidated Indebtedness\nThe following farms are under contract to close:\nFirst Midwest Loan\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1,916,699, or 84.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was largely the result of increased costs related to being a public company and our continued growth. We only incurred the costs of being a public company during the period following our IPO in 2014, while we incurred such costs for the entire year in 2015. During 2015, our public company costs increased $255,133 due to increased investor relations, board, regulatory and compliance activity, stock-based compensation expense increased $189,844, conference attendance and travel expenses increased $251,913, consulting fees increased $223,667, and other corporate costs increased $29,921, due to increased rent and general office expenses related to increased headcount, as compared with the same period in 2014. Also contributing to the general and administrative increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 were employee compensation expenses, which increased $1,185,817 as compared with the same period in 2014, as we did not have any employees prior to the IPO and have since increased our staffing to 13 employees and added a formal bonus program in the third quarter of 2014. These increases were offset by a decrease of $219,597 in professional fees which were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, on behalf of the Company by Pittman Hough Farms prior to the completion of the IPO.\nThe costs of growing crop are accumulated until the time of harvest at the lower of cost or market value and are included in inventory in our combined consolidated financial statements. Costs are allocated to growing crops based on a percentage of the total costs of production and total operating costs that are attributable to the portion of the crops that remain in inventory at the end of the year. Growing crop consists primarily of land preparation, cultivation, irrigation and fertilization costs incurred by FPI Agribusiness. Growing crop inventory is charged to cost of products sold when the related crop is harvested and sold.\nOverview\nAFFO is calculated by adjusting FFO to exclude or include the income and expenses that we believe are not reflective of the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance, as further explained below:\nReal Estate Acquisitions\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 74.1% of the OP units in the Operating Partnership.\nThe Bridge Loan Agreement contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, including: (i) the use of proceeds of the Bridge Loan must be used in connection with the acquisition of the Forsythe farms and (ii) the Bridge Borrower is generally restricted from incurring any additional indebtedness.\nSupply\nquality or profitability of our tenants' harvests, any of these factors could adversely affect our tenants' ability to meet their obligations to us and our ability to lease or re-lease properties on favorable terms.\nEBITDA is a key financial measure used to evaluate our operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, cash flows from operating activities or net income, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA is a standard performance measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts and investors in our industry. However, while EBITDA is a performance measure widely used across several industries, we do not believe that it correctly captures\n (6) On June 30, 2015, the Company acquired the Tomasek property from Mr. Pittman. In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed a two year lease with Astoria Farms with annual rents of $18,749. \n \u00b7 Increased payments of $82,000 to acquire other operating assets, primarily prepaid insurance and other annual public company costs; and \n \u00b7 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements; and \n \u00b7 Crop year adjusted revenue. In accordance with GAAP, rental payments are recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. With respect to leases entered into on acquired property, crop year adjusted revenue represents the difference between the pro rata contractual cash revenue for each crop year spread equally over the quarterly periods of ownership (without regard to the date of acquisition within the quarter) and the rent recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP. This application results in income recognition that can differ significantly from the current GAAP accounting. By adjusting for this item, we believe AFFO, provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our leases on a crop year basis, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. \nWe incur costs associated with running a public company, including, among others, costs associated with employing our personnel and compliance costs. We incur costs associated with due diligence and acquisitions, including, among others, travel expenses, consulting fees, and legal and accounting fees. We also incur costs associated with managing our farmland. The management of our farmland, generally, is not labor or capital intensive because farmland generally has minimal physical structures that require routine inspection and maintenance, and our leases, generally, are structured to require the tenant to pay many of the costs associated with the property. Furthermore, we believe that our platform is scalable, and we do not expect the expenses associated with managing our portfolio of farmland to increase significantly as the number of farm properties we own increases over time. Rather, we expect that as we continue to add additional farmland to our portfolio, we will be able to achieve economies of scale, which will enable us to reduce our operating costs per acre.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013\nreduce the amounts available to acquire additional farms, which could adversely affect our growth prospects. On March 14, 2016, we received from MetLife Agricultural Investments (\"MetLife\") commitments in the total aggregate amount of $127 million for mortgage loans secured by farmland. MetLife's loan commitments are subject to customary conditions, and expire between May 24, 2016 and June 14, 2016. We intend to use proceeds from these loans to refinance existing debt, to acquire new properties, and for general corporate purposes. We can provide no assurances that we will enter into a loan with MetLife on the terms we currently anticipate, or at all. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Properties-We have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding and significant near-term maturities, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations, restrict our operations and our ability to grow our business and revenues and restrict our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.\u201d\nbeen growing steadily, unusually favorable weather conditions in the world's major growing regions have led to a significant increase in supply. We believe that the current reduction in land values is likely to be limited and short-lived as global demand for food and agricultural commodities continues to outpace trendline supply, and represents a significant investment opportunity.\nWhen above or below market leases are acquired, we value the intangible assets based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases that are considered bargain renewal options. The above market lease values will be amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases. The fair value of acquired below market leases, included in deferred revenue on the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets, is amortized as an increase of rental income on a straight-line basis over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases, plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options of the respective leases.\nDepreciation and depletion expense increased $180,029, or 121.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of our investments in irrigation equipment as well as increased depreciation related to the $127,800,000 in acquisitions completed during 2014, of which $10,000,000 related to depreciable assets.\nThe Taxable REIT Subsidiary\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have completed the following acquisitions in 2016:\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $56,458,081 primarily as a result of the following:\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2,120,300 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expenses was a result largely of the beginning of our operations as an independent, publicly traded company and our subsequent rapid growth and more specifically, $648,177 increase in employee compensation as we did not have any employees prior to the IPO, $123,958 incurred related to the shared services agreement with Pittman Hough Farms, $53,125 incurred related to a consulting agreement entered into on April 16, 2014, $680,540 in amortization of restricted stock granted in conjunction with the IPO, $254,741in costs incurred as a result of becoming a public company, Board of Directors expenses of $196,504, travel costs of $58,853 and $219,597 in professional fees that FP Land agreed to reimburse Pittman Hough Farms prior to the completion of the IPO.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nFollow-on Equity Offering\n \u00b7 $48,000,000 of net proceeds from the IPO, which was completed on April 16, 2014; \nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 ( ASU 2014-09\u201d). ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is prohibited. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's combined consolidated financial statements.\n \u00b7 Repayment of $12,311,237 in outstanding debt; \nThese acquisitions are expected to close in the first half of 2016, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied or that the pending acquisitions will be consummated on the terms described herein, or at all.\nWe succeeded to the operations of our predecessor, FP Land LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( FP Land\u201d or our Predecessor\u201d) upon completion of the underwritten initial public offering of 3,800,000 shares of our common stock (the IPO\u201d) on April 16, 2014. Concurrently with the completion of the IPO, FP Land merged with and into the Operating Partnership, with the Operating Partnership surviving (the FP Land Merger\u201d). As a result of the FP Land Merger, the Operating Partnership acquired the 38 farms and three grain storage facilities owned indirectly by our Predecessor and assumed the ownership and operation of our Predecessor's business.\nThe market for farmland is dominated by buyers who are existing farm owners and operators. As a result of a decline in commodity prices in 2014 and 2015, farmland values in many agricultural markets have experienced modest declines recently after substantial increases over the prior several years. While demand for agricultural commodities has\nWe record revenue from the sale of harvested crops when the harvested crop has been delivered to a grain facility and\nWe account for all acquisitions in accordance with the business combinations standard. When we acquire farmland that was previously operated as a rental property, we evaluate whether a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of closing of the acquisition. If a lease is in place or a crop is being produced at the time of acquisition, we account for the transaction as a business combination and charge the costs associated with the acquisition to acquisition and due diligence costs on the statement of operations as incurred. Otherwise, acquisitions with no lease in place or crops being produced at the time of acquisition are accounted for as asset acquisitions. When we acquire farmland in a sale-lease back transaction with newly originated leases entered into with the seller, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition and capitalize the transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition.\nNet cash used for investing activities increased approximately $124,646,896 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the following:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCertain of our leases provide for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds, a percentage of harvested crops, or a fixed crop quantity at a fixed price. As of December 31, 2015, a majority of such leases provided for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds. Revenue under leases providing for a payment equal to a percentage of the harvested crop or a percentage of the gross farm proceeds is recognized upon notification from the grain facility that grain has been delivered in the our name or when the tenant has notified us of the total amount of gross farm proceeds.\n (2) On April 10, 2015, the Company issued 118,634 OP units (with a fair value of $1,372,595 as of the date of closing) as partial consideration for the acquisition of the Nebraska Battle Creek farms. \nIn connection with the issuance of the Preferred Units, beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we intend to further adjust FFO to reflect the fact that, until the holders of the Preferred Units convert their Preferred Units to common OP units, which may occur on or after March 2, 2026, their impact on the our cash flow will be fixed and certain, while their impact on shares outstanding will be uncertain. Therefore, we intend to adjust FFO by subtracting the amount of dividends payable on the Preferred Units, and exclude the Preferred Units in the calculation of common shares fully diluted.\nSubstantially all of the leases for our portfolio are structured in such a way that we are responsible for major maintenance, certain insurance and taxes (which are sometimes reimbursed to us by our tenants), while our tenant is responsible for minor maintenance, water usage and all of the additional input costs related to farming operations on the property, such as seed, fertilizer, labor and fuel. We expect that substantially all of the leases for farmland we acquire in the future will continue to be structured in a manner consistent with substantially all of our existing leases. As the owner of the land, we generally only bear costs related to major capital improvements permanently attached to the property, such as irrigation systems, drainage tile, grain storage facilities, permanent plantings or other physical structures customary for farms. In cases where capital expenditures are necessary, we typically seek to offset, over a period of multiple years, the costs of such capital expenditures by increasing rental rates. We also incur the costs associated with maintaining liability and casualty insurance.\nTotal rental income increased $9,577,220, or 241.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of the 55 acquisitions completed over the last two years. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio increased to $215 per acre from $179 per acre in 2014. This increase was the result of diversification of our portfolio to new markets.\n \u00b7 Completing 26 acquisitions in 2015 for aggregate cash consideration of $109,309,474, as compared to $126,250,011 in aggregate cash consideration for 29 acquisitions in 2014; \nLeases in place as of December 31, 2015 had terms ranging from one to five years. As of December 31, 2015 we had 17 leases with renewal options and three leases with rent escalations. The majority of our leases provide for a fixed cash rent payment. Tenant leases on acquired farms generally require the tenant to pay the Company rent for the entire initial year regardless of the date of acquisition, if the acquisition is closed prior to, or shortly after, planting of crops. If the acquisition is closed later in the year, we typically receive a partial rent payment or no rent payment at all.\n \u00b7 Real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs. Acquisition expenses are incurred for investment purposes and therefore, do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our leases, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. This exclusion also improves comparability of our results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. \nThe Operating Partnership leases certain of its farms to the TRS, which is subject to federal and state income taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis and for operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not they will be realized on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. There was no taxable income from the TRS for the year ended December 31, 2015, and at December 31, 2015, we did not have any deferred tax assets or liabilities.\n (5) The Justice farms are located in Beaufort, Currituck, Pamlico, Pasquotank and Perquimans counties, NC; Marlboro County, SC; and Chesapeake, VA. \nCash rental income for the same-property portfolio decreased to $2,615,718 for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $2,634,525 for 2014, as a result of average annual rent for the same-property portfolio decreasing to $357 per acre in 2015 from $360 per acre in 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower crop share rent in 2015.\nTenant reimbursements increased $247,664 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, and property operating expenses increased $211,108 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Both of these increases are due to the fact that in 2013, all but two of our leases required the tenants to directly pay all expenses incurred during the lease term in connection with the leased farms, including property taxes and maintenance. In 2014, leases that formerly provided for tenant payment of property taxes, requireed the tenant to reimburse us for the amount we paid in 2015. We accrued the expected tenant reimbursements for the year ended December 31, 2014, which are expected to be paid in 2015. Additionally, the tenants on the Hudye farms were required to reimburse us $18,595 for the 2013 taxes payable in 2014.\nNet cash used for investing activities decreased $6,605,660 primarily as a result of the following:\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of improvements on our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\n \u00b7 Other contractual debt payments of $6,050,300 made in 2015, compared to $1,032,100 in contractual debt payments made during 2014; \n \u00b7 Fully diluted shares of common stock. In accordance with GAAP, shares of common stock used to calculate earnings per share are presented on a weighted average basis. Common shares on a fully diluted basis includes shares of common stock, OP units and unvested restricted stock outstanding at the end of the period on a share equivalent basis, because all shares are participating securities and thus share in the performance of the Company. \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe recognize interest income on notes receivable on an accrual basis over the life of the note. Direct origination costs are netted against loan origination fees and are amortized over the life of the note using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, as an adjustment to interest income which is included in operating revenue as a component of other income in the our Combined Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWhen a sale occurs, we recognize the associated gain when all consideration has been transferred, the sale has closed, and there is no material continuing involvement. If a sale is expected to generate a loss, we first assess it through the impairment evaluation process-see \u2018\u2018Impairment of Real Estate Assets'' below.\nThe Bridge Loan matures on April 29, 2016, subject to three one-month extensions at the Bridge Borrower's option, and is secured by first lien mortgages on the Forsythe farms. Interest on the Bridge Loan is payable in cash monthly and\n \u00b7 Cash received from the sale of an easements and right of way totaling $144,020 made in 2014; \nConditions in Our Existing Markets\n \u00b7 Payments of $780,917 in offering costs made during 2015, as compared to $2,255,090 in payments during 2014; \n \u00b7 Repurchase and retire of $20,932 of common stock during 2015. \nNM = Not Meaningful\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur revenues are generated from renting farmland to operators of farming businesses. Our leases have terms ranging from one to five years. Although the majority of our leases do not provide the tenant with a contractual right to renew the lease upon its expiration, we believe it is customary to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to renew the lease, subject to any increase in the rental rate that we may establish. If the tenant elects not to renew the lease at the end of the lease term, the land will be offered to a new tenant.\nIn addition to utilizing current and any future available borrowings, we entered into equity distribution agreements on September 15, 2015, under which we may issue and sell from time to time, through the sales agents, shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $25,000,000. This at-the-market\u201d equity offering program is intended to provide additional financing alternatives in the capital markets and we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering, if any, for future farmland acquisitions in accordance with our investment strategy and for general corporate purposes, which may also include originating loans to farmers under our recently announced loan program. We only intend to utilize the equity offering should the market price of our common stock reach levels which are deemed appropriate.\nIn connection with the IPO and the related formation transactions, on April 16, 2014, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and First Midwest Bank, as lender, entered into the Amended and Restated Business Loan Agreement, as amended on February 24, 2015, July 24, 2015 and on March 6, 2016 (the FMW Loan Agreement\u201d), which provided for loans in the initial aggregate principal amount of approximately $30,780,000 (together, the First Midwest Loan\u201d). The First Midwest Loan is secured by first mortgages and assignments of rents encumbering 24 of our farms and two of our grain storage facilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had $26,650,000 outstanding under the First Midwest Loan.\nAcquisitions Completed to date in 2016\nWe are party to the Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2015 and subsequently amended (the Bond Purchase Agreement\u201d), with Farmer Mac and the Purchaser, regarding a secured bond purchase facility that as of December 31, 2015 has a maximum borrowing capacity of $165 million. Pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, the Operating Partnership may, from time to time, issue one or more bonds to the Purchaser that will be secured by pools of mortgage loans, which will, in turn, be secured by first liens on agricultural real estate owned by us. The mortgage loans may have effective loan-to-value ratios of up to 60%, after giving effect to the overcollateralization obligations described below. Prepayment of each bond issuance is not permitted unless otherwise agreed upon by all parties to the Bond Purchase Agreement.\nUpon acquisition of real estate, we allocate the purchase price of the real estate based upon the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, which historically have consisted of land, drainage improvements, irrigation improvements, groundwater, permanent plantings (bushes, shrubs, vines, perennials) and grain facilities and may also consist of intangible assets including in-place leases, above market and below market leases and tenant relationships. We allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of acquired real estate by valuing the land as if it were unimproved. We value improvements, including permanent plantings and grain facilities, at replacement cost as new adjusted for depreciation.\n \u00b7 Debt prepayments of $3,078,000 on the First Midwest bank debt during 2015, as compared to $11,279,137 in 2014; \n\nOn February 29, 2016, we closed on a $53,000,000 bridge term loan (the Bridge Loan\u201d), with the proceeds used to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the Forsythe Farm acquisition. The term note has a maturity of two months, with three one-month extension options, subject to the payment of a 1% extension fee at each extension, and has an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 3%.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $23,514,296 of cash and cash equivalents compared to $33,736,166 at December 31, 2014.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland, make other investments and certain long-term capital expenditures, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, and make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including future equity issuances (including issuances of OP units), net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d). ASU 2015-03 requires the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred charge asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-03 as of June 30, 2015. All periods presented have been retroactively adjusted.\nThe Guaranty contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including: (i) a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 60%; (ii) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter; (iii) a minimum tangible net worth; (iv) a general restriction on incurring additional indebtedness subject to certain exceptions, including indebtedness for property acquisitions of up to $6.0 million; (v) a restriction on investments in excess of $10.0 million in the aggregate without the prior written consent of the Lender subject to certain limited exceptions; and (vi) a restriction on modifying terms of the Preferred Units (as defined below).\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of AFFO share information to basic weighted average common shares outstanding, the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent, for the periods indicated below (unaudited):\nThe First Midwest Loan has a maturity date of June 4, 2016, with respect to $26,000,000 of the currently outstanding principal of the loan, and the remaining balance matures on June 28, 2016. The loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 2.59%, but in any event not less than a rate per annum of 2.80%, and requires us to make quarterly interest payments on the 30th day of each calendar quarter and a principal payment of $26,000,000 on June 16, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated With Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting ( ASU 2015-15\u201d), which clarified that the SEC would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. ASU 2015-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. We have assessed the impact of ASU 2015-15 and it does not have a material effect on our combined consolidated financial statements or financial covenants.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated below (unaudited):\nHarvested crop inventory includes costs accumulated during both the growing and harvesting phases and is stated at the lower of those costs or the estimated net realizable value, which is the market price, based upon the nearest market in the geographic region, less any cost of disposition. Cost of disposition includes broker's commissions, freight and other marketing costs.\nThe Bridge Loan Agreement includes certain customary events of default, including a cross-default provision related to other outstanding indebtedness of the Company and the Operating Partnership, the occurrence of any of which, after any applicable cure period, would permit the Bridge Lender, among other things, to accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Loan and to exercise its remedies with respect to the pledged collateral, including foreclosure and sale of the Forsythe farms.\nWe are currently negotiating leases on 3,158 acres, have 15,879 acres which have lease payments based on a percentage of farming revenues or crops and have 641 acres leased to our taxable REIT subsidiary, which are not included in the table above. We expect market rents in the coming year to be consistent with expiring rents.\nUnder the FMW Loan Agreement, we are subject to ongoing compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio of 0.60 to 1.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.00. Each covenant is measured annually as of December 31st of each year. Additionally, we are required to maintain a minimum cash account balance of $500,000 during the term of the agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2015.\nIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which amends or supersedes the scope and consolidation guidance under existing GAAP. The new standard changes the way a reporting entity evaluates whether (a) limited partnerships and similar entities should be consolidated, (b) fees paid to decision makers or service providers are variable interests in a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d), and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties require the reporting entity to consolidate the VIE. ASU 2015-02 also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We intend to adopt this pronouncement during the three months ending March 31, 2016, and do not anticipate a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows from adopting this standard.\nFinancing Activity\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nOur estimates of land value are made using a comparable sales analysis. Factors considered by us in our analysis of land value include soil types and water availability and the sales prices of comparable farms. Our estimates of groundwater value are made using historical information obtained regarding the applicable aquifer. Factors considered by us in our analysis of groundwater value are related to the location of the aquifer and whether or not the aquifer is a depletable resource or a replenishing resource. If the aquifer is a replenishing resource, no value is allocated to the groundwater. We include an estimate of property taxes in the purchase price allocation of acquisitions to account for the expected liability that was assumed.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased approximately $1,758,962, primarily as a result of the following:\n \u00b7 Funding of $2,830,000 in notes receivable, which was offset by $23,003 of net origination fees received. \n (1) On March 2, 2015 the transaction closed with an estimated purchase price consisting of (a) $50.0 million in cash, (b) an aggregate of 2,608,695 OP units valued at $11.50 per OP unit, or $30.0 million in the aggregate, and (c) 117,000 Preferred Units with an aggregate value of $117.0 million. \nInflation\nFarmer Mac Facility\nfarmland, and our ability to increase or maintain rental revenues while controlling expenses. Although farmland prices may show a decline from time to time, we believe that any reduction in U.S. farmland values overall is likely to be short-lived as global demand for food and agricultural commodities typically exceeds global supply. In addition, although prices for many crops experienced significant declines in 2014 and 2015, we do not believe that such declines represent a trend that will continue over the long term. Rather, we believe that long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time.\nBecause the leases for a majority of the properties in our portfolio require payment of at least 50% of the annual rent in advance of each spring planting season, we receive a significant portion of our cash rental payments in the first calendar quarter of each year, although we recognize rental revenue from these leases on a pro rata basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe perform an annual review for any uncertain tax positions and, if necessary, will record future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements. An uncertain tax position is defined as a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is not based on clear and unambiguous tax law and which is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. At December 31, 2015 we did not identify any uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company and the Operating Partnership are parties to a bond purchase agreement (the Bond Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ( Farmer Mac\u201d) and Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities Corporation (the Purchaser\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Farmer Mac, as bond purchaser, regarding a secured note purchase facility (as amended, the Farmer Mac Facility\u201d) that had a maximum borrowing capacity of $165.0 million at December 31, 2015, with $160.6 million outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further details.\nOther revenues totaled $73,169 during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to no other revenues realized in 2014. The other revenues recognized during 2015 were generated on interest and amortization of net loan fees, primarily from the FPI Loan Program, launched in August 2015. An initial $1,800,000 mortgage note receivable was issued in August 2015, and a $980,000 mortgage note was issued to a separate party in November 2015. See - Recent Developments-FPI Loan Program.\u201d\nLegal and accounting expenses decreased $16,755 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. In 2014, the Company incurred $537,533 in audit and accounting fees and $77,805 in legal fees, as a result of becoming a public company. In 2013, the Company incurred $620,000 related to the preparation of financial statements for use in connection with the IPO.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments ( ASU 2015-16\u201d), pertaining to entities that have reported provisional amounts for items in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized. The guidance requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Any adjustments should be calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-16 for the quarterly period ending December 31, 2015.\nWe expect that global demand for food, driven primarily by significant increases in the global population and GDP per capita, will continue to be the key driver of farmland values. We further expect that global demand for most crops will continue to grow to keep pace with global population growth, which we anticipate will lead to either higher prices and/or higher yields and, therefore, higher rental rates on our farmland, as well as sustained growth in farmland values over the long-term. We also believe that growth in global GDP per capita, particularly in developing nations, will contribute significantly to increasing demand for primary crops. As global GDP per capita increases, the composition of daily caloric intake is expected to shift away from the direct consumption of primary crops toward animal-based proteins, which is expected to result in increased demand for primary crops as feed for livestock. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization ( UN FAO\u201d), these factors are expected to require more than one billion additional tons of global annual grain production by 2050, a 45.5% increase from 2005-2007 levels and more than two times the 475 million tons of grain produced in the United States in 2014. Furthermore, we believe that, as GDP per capita grows, a significant portion of additional household income is allocated to food and that once individuals increase consumption of, and spending on, higher quality food, they will strongly resist returning to their former dietary habits, resulting in greater inelasticity in the demand for food. As a result, we believe that, as global demand for food increases, rental rates on our farmland and the value of our farmland will increase over the long-term. Global demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels such as ethanol and soy diesel also could impact the prices of corn and soybeans, which, in the long-term, could impact our rental revenues and our results of operations. However, the success of our business strategy is not dependent on growth in demand for biofuels and we do not believe that demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels will materially impact our results of operations or the value of our farmland, primarily because we believe that growth in global population and GDP per capita will be more significant drivers of global demand for primary crops over the long-term.\n \u00b7 Increase of $923,975 in employee compensation paid; \nmeasure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\n \u00b7 Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation is a non-cash expense and therefore, does not correlate with the ongoing operations. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO improves comparability of our results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. \n \u00b7 Real estate related acquisition audit fees. A portion of the audit fees we incur is directly related to acquisitions, and varies with the number and complexity of the acquisitions we evaluate and complete in a given period. As such, these costs do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our current acquisition strategy, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. This exclusion also improves comparability of our results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. \nUsing information available at the time of acquisition, we allocate the total consideration to tangible assets and liabilities and identified intangible assets and liabilities. We may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocations after obtaining more information about asset valuations and liabilities assumed.\n\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) and Adjusted EBITDA\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOur real estate consists of land, groundwater and improvements made to the land consisting of grain facilities, irrigation improvements, other assets and drainage improvements. We record real estate at cost and capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. We expense costs of repairs and maintenance as such costs are incurred. We begin depreciating assets when the asset is ready for its intended use. We compute depreciation and depletion for assets classified as improvements using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 10-40 years for grain facilities, 2-40 years for irrigation improvements, 27-65 for drainage improvements, 3-50 years for groundwater, 23 years for permanent plantings, and 5-40 years for other assets acquired. We periodically evaluate the estimated useful lives for groundwater based on current state water regulations and depletion levels of the aquifers.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nAs a REIT, for income tax purposes we are permitted to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders, thereby eliminating the U.S. federal taxation of income represented by such distributions at the Company level, provided certain requirements are met. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.\n results over each reporting period and of our company with other real estate operators. There were no indirect offering costs in periods prior to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. \nOn February 29, 2016, the Bridge Borrower entered into the Bridge Loan Agreement with the Bridge Lender that provides for a loan of $53.0 million, the proceeds of which were used primarily to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition of the Forsythe farms, which was completed on March 2, 2016. The Company is currently in negotiations with certain lenders to provide long-term secured debt financing to repay the Bridge Loan at or prior to its maturity, but the Company can provide no assurances that it will be able to enter into such financing on favorable terms or at all.\nWe are an internally managed real estate company that owns and seeks to acquire high-quality farmland located in agricultural markets throughout North America. As of the date of this Annual Report, we own or have under contract 258 farms with an aggregate of 108,163 acres (including 5 farms totaling 8,591 acres under contract) in Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. As of the date of this Annual Report, the majority of the acres in our portfolio are used to grow primary crops, such as corn, soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton, while some of our farms produce specialty crops, such as blueberries, vegetables and edible beans. However, over the long term, we expect that our farmland portfolio will be comprised of approximately 80% primary crop farmland and 20% specialty crop farmland, which we believe will give investors exposure to the increasing global food demand trend in the face of growing scarcity of high quality farmland and will reflect the approximate breakdown of U.S. agricultural output between primary crops and animal protein (whose production relies principally on primary crops as feed), on one hand, and specialty crops, on the other. In addition, in August 2015, the Company announced the launch of the FPI Loan Program, an agricultural lending product aimed at farmers, as a complement to the Company's primary business of acquiring and owning farmland and leasing it to farmers. Under the FPI Loan Program, we intend to make loans to third-party farmers (both tenant and non-tenant) to provide partial financing for working capital requirements and operational farming activities, farming infrastructure projects, and for other farming and agricultural real estate related purposes.\naccrues at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum. In addition, under the Bridge Loan Agreement, the Bridge Borrower paid an origination fee of 4.00% of the loan amount and is required to pay an extension fee of 1.00% of the loan amount for each one-month extension and a default fee of 2.00% of the loan amount if the Bridge Loan is not repaid at maturity. The Bridge Borrower may prepay the Bridge Loan, subject to paying the Lender any LIBOR brokerage costs.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nThe balance of the First Midwest Loan may be prepaid by us in whole or in part without any prepayment penalties. The First Midwest Loan contains customary events of default, including defaults in the payment of principal or interest, defaults in compliance with the covenants contained in the documents evidencing the loans, defaults in payments under any other documents covering any part of the properties, and bankruptcy or other insolvency events.\n \u00b7 Borrowings from mortgage notes payable of $82,475,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to borrowings of $81,100,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2014; \nThe principal factors affecting our operating results and the value of our farmland include global demand for food relative to the global supply of food, farmland fundamentals and economic conditions in the markets in which we own\nOn July 21, 2015, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 3,360,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $11.00 and generated gross proceeds of approximately $37.0 million. The aggregate net proceeds to the Company, after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $34.6 million.\nRental income for the same-property portfolio increased $265,554, or 11.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of average annual cash rent for the same-property portfolio increasing to $365 per acre for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $327 per acre in 2013.\nOn September 15, 2015, the Company filed a prospectus supplement under which it may sell shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $25,000,000 through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program. The offering is made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 14, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, no shares had been issued under the program.\nInterest expense increased by $3,244,272 or 236.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of an increase in our average outstanding borrowings, which were $159,233,978 during the year December 31, 2015 and $44,426,322 for 2014. Our weighted average cost of borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 2.80% and 2.76%, respectively. We also recognized additional interest expense of $225,134 and $138,369 during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred loan fees. These increases were partially offset by the amortization of a premium on our debt of $69,989 during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn addition, on February 29, 2016, we closed on the $53,000,000 Bridge Loan, which has a maturity date of April 29, 2016, with three one-month extension options, subject to the payment of a 1% extension fee at each extension.\ntitle has transferred. Harvested crops delivered under marketing contracts are recorded using the fixed price of the marketing contract at the time of delivery to a grain facility. Harvested crops delivered without a marketing contract are recorded using the market price at the date the harvested crop is delivered to the grain facility and title has transferred.\n \u00b7 Proceeds from an equity offering of $35,112,000 during 2015, compared to total proceeds of $93,620,980 from an initial public offering and subsequent equity offering during 2014; \nThe leases for the majority of the properties in our portfolio provide that tenants must pay us at least 50% (and often 100%) of the annual rent in advance of each spring planting season. As a result, we collect a significant portion of total annual rents in the first calendar quarter of each year. We believe our use of leases pursuant to which at least 50% of the\nAcross our entire portfolio, we are experiencing flat to modestly declining rent rates in connection with lease renewals. In order to offer our tenants a better match between cash inflows and outflows, in 2016 a higher portion than in 2015 of our fixed cash leases provides for payment of 50% of a year's rent after harvest. We believe quality farmland in the United States has a near-zero vacancy rate as a result of the supply and demand fundamentals discussed above. We believe rental rates for farmland are a function of farmland operators' view of the long-term profitability of farmland, and that many farm operators will continue to compete for farmland even during periods of decreased profitability due to the scarcity of farmland available to rent. In particular, we believe that due to the relatively high fixed costs associated with farming operations (including equipment, labor and knowledge), many farm operators in some circumstances will rent additional acres of farmland when it becomes available in order to allocate their fixed costs over more acres. Furthermore, because it is generally customary in the farming industry to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to re-lease the land at the end of each lease term, we believe that many farm operators will rent additional land that becomes available in order to control the ability to farm that land in future periods when profitability is higher. As a result, in our experience, many farm operators will aggressively pursue rental opportunities in close proximity to their existing operations when they arise, even when the farmer anticipates lower current returns or short-term losses. In addition, because many farmers both own farmland and rent additional farmland from other landowners, we believe that many farmers will choose to subsidize losses on rented land during periods of lower profitability with relatively higher profits generated by land that they own and that has comparatively lower fixed costs. Due to the short term nature of most of our leases, we believe that a recovery of crop prices and farm profitability will be reflected relatively rapidly in our revenues via increases in rent rates.\nGlobal supply of agricultural commodities is driven by two primary factors, the number of tillable acres available for crop production and the productivity of the acres being farmed. Although the amount of global cropland in use has gradually increased over time, growth has plateaued over the last 20 years. Cropland area continues to increase in developing countries, but after accounting for expected continuing cropland loss, the UN FAO projects only 171 million acres will be added from 2005-2007 to 2050, a 4.3% increase. In comparison, world population is expected to grow over the same period to 9.7 billion, a nearly 40% increase. While we expect growth in the global supply of arable land, we also expect that landowners will only put that land into production if increases in commodity prices and the value of farmland cause landowners to benefit economically from using the land for farming rather than alternative uses. We also believe that decreases in the amount of arable land in the United States and globally as a result of increasing urbanization will partially offset the impact of additional supply of farmland. The global supply of food is also impacted by the productivity per acre of tillable land. Historically, productivity gains (measured by average crop yields) have been driven by advances in seed technology, farm equipment, irrigation techniques and chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, we expect the increasing shortage of water in many irrigated growing regions in the United States and other growing regions around the globe, often as a result of new water restrictions imposed by laws or regulations, to lead to decreased productivity growth on many acres and, in some cases, cause yields to decline on those acres.\n \u00b7 $43,300,000 of net proceeds from the Follow-on Offering, which was completed on July 30, 2014; \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nCertain of our leases provide for minimum cash rent plus a bonus based on gross farm proceeds. Revenue under this type of lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term based on the minimum cash rent. Bonus rent is recognized upon notification from the tenant of the gross farm proceeds for the year.\nIn connection with the Term Loan, on February 29, 2016, the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into a guaranty (the Guaranty\u201d) whereby the Company and the Operating Partnership jointly and severally agreed unconditionally to guarantee all of the Bridge Borrower's obligations under the Bridge Loan.\nWe elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe do not, however, believe that FFO is the only measure of the sustainability of our operating performance. Changes in GAAP accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in FFO that do not correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance. Therefore, in addition to FFO, we present AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company's operational performance than FFO. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. Even AFFO, however, does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts, especially in connection with full-year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms. Management considers AFFO per share, fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to GAAP earnings per share. AFFO per share, fully diluted provides additional insight into how our operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted and, accordingly, our AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted may not always be comparable to AFFO and AFFO per share amounts calculated by other REITs. AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to net income (loss) earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.\nOur exposure to short-term crop price fluctuations, related to farming operations conducted by our TRS, is generally limited by current marketing contracts or other sales arrangements, which the Company may enter into throughout the growing season, and by the availability of grain storage capacity, which gives us the ability to delay the delivery of crops until after seasonal price declines.\n \u00b7 Increase of $601,251 on property other taxes; \n \u00b7 Decrease in cash paid for interest of $368,405, during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of the timing of interest payments on the current indebtedness and the payoff of $12,300,000 of outstanding indebtedness in 2014. \nWe further adjust EBITDA for certain additional items such as crop year adjusted revenue, stock based compensation, indirect equity offering costs, real estate acquisition related audit fees and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs (for a full discussion of these adjustments see AFFO adjustments discussed above) that we consider necessary to understand our operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance.\nThe purchase price is allocated to in-place lease values and tenant relationships, if they are acquired, based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. The value of in-place lease intangibles and tenant relationships will be included as components of deferred leasing intangibles, and will be amortized over the remaining lease term (and expected renewal periods of the respective leases for tenant relationships) as amortization expense. If a tenant terminates its lease prior to its stated expiration, any unamortized amounts relating to that lease, including (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place lease values, and (iii) tenant relationships, would be recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate. We capitalize acquisition costs and due diligence costs if the asset is expected to qualify as an asset acquisition. If the asset acquisition is abandoned, the capitalized asset acquisition costs will be expensed to acquisition and due diligence costs in the period of abandonment.\nAcquisition and due diligence costs increased $193,039 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of $111,377 in costs directly related to the six business combinations completed in 2014, $70,377 in costs directly related to asset acquisitions that were abandoned and due diligence efforts on other prospective business combinations.\nFarm leases are often short-term in nature. As of December 31, 2015 our portfolio had the following lease expirations as a percentage of approximate acres leased and annualized minimum cash rents:\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \u00b7 Increase in employee compensation paid of $648,000; \nOn August 24, 2015, the Company entered into a promissory note agreement with a third-party non-tenant farmer to provide up to $2,000,000 in the form of a mortgage note. The note is collateralized by a first mortgage on farm real estate. Currently, $1,800,000 has been funded with the remaining $200,000 of funding subject to the satisfaction of customary lending requirements, including finalization and issuance of the title research and appraisal report. The note has a fixed interest rate and all principal and accrued interest due at maturity, which was initially January 15, 2016 but has been extended by one year with the first year's interest received at the time of the extension.\nOur rental income for 2015 was impacted by the 29 acquisitions that took place in 2014, primarily in the fourth quarter, in addition to the 26 acquisitions that took place throughout 2015. To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we have separately discussed the rental income for the same-property portfolio, which includes only properties owned and operated for the entirety of both periods presented. The same-property portfolio for the periods presented includes the 38 farms and three grain storage facilities contributed to us by our Predecessor at the time of the IPO.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in the notes to the historical combined consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing. We have set forth below those accounting policies that we believe require material subjective or complex judgments and have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis, based on information that is then available to us, our experience and various matters that we believe are reasonable and appropriate for consideration under the circumstances.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offering Program\nThe Bond Purchase Agreement and the Pledge Agreement include customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which, after any applicable cure period, would permit the Purchaser and Farmer Mac to, among other things, accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility and to exercise its remedies with respect to the pledged collateral, including foreclosure and sale of the agricultural real estate underlying the pledged mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2015, we had $160,575,000 outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nDemand\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $33,736,166 of cash and cash equivalents compared to $17,805 at December 31, 2013.\nOther inventory, such as fertilizer and pesticides, is valued at the lower of cost or market.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014 we had 16,155,971 and 9,676,755 shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, respectively.\nIn August 2015, the Company introduced the FPI Loan Program, an agricultural lending product aimed at farmers as a complement to the Company's current business of acquiring and owning farmland and leasing it to farmers. Under the FPI Loan Program, the Company makes loans to third-party farmers (both tenant and non-tenant) to provide partial financing for working capital requirements and operational farming activities, farming infrastructure projects, and for other farming and agricultural real estate related projects. These loans are collateralized by farm real estate and are to be in principal amounts of $500,000 or more at fixed interest rates with maturities of up to three years. The Company expects the borrower to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements based on farming operations and access to other forms of capital, as permitted. Notes receivable are stated at their unpaid principal balance, and include unamortized direct origination costs and accrued interest through the reporting date, less any allowance for losses and unearned borrower paid points.\nResults of Operations\n \u00b7 Increase in acquisition and due diligence costs of $193,039; \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $5,912,190, primarily as a result of the following:\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013\n \u00b7 Dividend and distribution payments of $5,944,130 to common stockholders and OP unitholders made in 2015, compared to dividends payments and net distributions to members of $2,713,376 during 2014; and \nRental income includes rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its lease. Minimum rents pursuant to leases are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including renewal options in the case of below market leases. Deferred revenue includes the cumulative difference between the rental revenue recorded on a straight-line basis and the cash rent received from tenants in accordance with the lease terms. Acquired below market leases are included in deferred revenue on the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets, which are amortized into rental income over the life of the respective leases, plus the terms of the below market renewal options, if any.\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015:\nThe value of a crop is affected by many factors that can differ on a yearly basis. Weather conditions and crop disease in major crop production regions worldwide creates a significant risk of price volatility, which may either increase or decrease the value of the crops that our tenants produce each year. Other material factors adding to the volatility of crop prices are changes in government regulations and policy, fluctuations in global prosperity, fluctuations in foreign trade and export markets, and eruptions of military conflicts or civil unrest. Prices for many annual crops, particularly corn, experienced significant declines in 2014 and 2015, but we do not believe that such declines represent a trend that will continue over the long term. Rather, we believe that those declines in prices for annual crops represented a combination of correction to historical norms (adjusted for inflation) and high yields induced by unusually favorable weather patterns, and that continued long-term growth trends in global population and GDP per capita will result in increased prices for primary crops over time. Although annual rental payments under the majority of our leases are not based expressly on the\nSeasonality\nTotal rental income increased approximately $1,620,436, or 69.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily resulting from the completion of 29 acquisitions during 2014, 19 of which were completed in December. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the average annual cash rent for the entire portfolio decreased to $179 per acre from $326 per acre in 2013. The decrease in average annual cash rent per acre is a result of an emphasis of our acquisition activity on farmland characterized by lower price and rent per acre than the pre-existing portfolio. As a result of completing 19 acquisitions in December 2014, we did not have leases in place for all properties and did not receive rental income on the majority of the properties acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nExpenses\nLegal and accounting expenses increased $475,001, or 77.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of being a public company for a full year with the Company going public in April 2014. Also contributing to the increase in legal and accounting expenses were general corporate matters and the growth of our portfolio.\n\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets\n (3) On April 10, 2015, the Company issued 119,953 OP units (with a fair value of $1,387,856 as of the date of closing) as partial consideration for the acquisition of the Northeast Nebraska farms. \nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results of operations and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplemental measure of our performance.\nOn November 16, 2015, the Company entered into a promissory note agreement with a tenant farmer to provide $980,000 in the form of a mortgage note. The note has a fixed annual interest rate with principal and all accrued interest due at maturity on October 30, 2017. The note is collateralized by a first mortgage on farm real estate.\nIn connection with the FMW Loan Agreement, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership unconditionally agreed to guarantee all of the obligations of the Operating Partnership under the FMW Loan Agreement. In addition, Paul A. Pittman, our Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jesse J. Hough, our\nInventory of our TRS\nSources and Uses of Cash\n\nNM = Not Meaningful\n \u00b7 An increase in cash paid for interest of $2,949,027 due to an increase in average outstanding indebtedness of approximately $115,500,000, year-to-year. \n \u00b7 As a result of the completion of the formation transactions, the Company had a reduction in net distributions to non-controlling interest in operating partnership or net distributions to members of $5,181,212; and \n (4) On June 2, 2015, the Company issued 824,398 shares of common stock and 1,993,709 OP units, of which 883,724 units are redeemable for cash or at the Company's option into shares of common stock on a one for one basis up to a maximum of 1,109,985 shares (with an aggregate fair value of $30,914,634, as of the date of closing), as partial consideration for the acquisition of the Justice farms. See Note 9-Stockholders Equity and Non-controlling Interests\u201d. \nProperty operating expenses increased $855,015, or 343.9%, for the 2015 year, as compared to the prior year, of which $243,416 is attributable to acquired properties during 2015. The remaining increase in property operating expenses is primarily related to increases in property insurance of $111,694, property taxes of $224,062, state franchise taxes of $113,137, and repairs of $53,650. Also increasing during the year were travel costs related to property visits on newly acquired properties of $42,987 and $48,076 expensed for legal costs related to tenant issues.\n (2) The Forsythe farms are located in Edgar, Clark, Coles, Crawford, Douglas, Vermilion & Cumberland counties, Illinois. \nDepreciation and depletion expense increased $564,733, or 171.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is the result of acquiring $7,468,127 in depreciable assets in the last quarter of 2014, $7,000,392 in depreciable assets throughout 2015 and investing $5,637,733 in property improvements on acquired property during 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n (1) On March 13, 2015, the Company issued 63,581 shares of common stock (with a fair value of $712,743 as of the date of closing) as partial consideration for the acquisition of the Timmerman farm. \nRevenue Recognition\n \u00b7 Receipt of $5,310,267 in cash rents for the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $1,364,737 was included in deferred revenue at year end, as compared to $1,899,192 in cash rents for the year ended December 31, 2013; \n \u00b7 Additional operating costs of $704,682 directly related to being a public company; and \nFPI Loan Program\n \u00b7 Indirect offering costs. Indirect offering costs are fees for services incurred by the Company to grow and maintain an active institutional investor presence. As we continue to acquire more farms and farmland, our ability to access capital through the equity markets will remain a critical component of our growth strategy. As of September 30, 2015, we began excluding indirect offering costs from AFFO as we believe it improves comparability of our \nLeases in place in 2014 that provide for tenant payment of property taxes required the tenant to reimburse us for the tax amount we paid in 2015 for the 2014 taxable year. Due to changes in terms of lease renewals, as well as of certain outstanding leases, tenant reimbursements decreased $112,367, or 45.4%, in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nAll of the leases for the farmland in our portfolio have one- to five-year terms, pursuant to which each tenant is responsible for substantially all of the operating expenses related to the property, including taxes, maintenance, water usage and insurance. As a result, we believe that the effect on us of inflationary increases in operating expenses may be offset in part by the operating expenses that are passed through to our tenants and by contractual rent increases because our leases will be renegotiated every one to five years. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\n\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net income (loss) to FFO, AFFO and net income available to common stockholders per share to AFFO per share, fully diluted, the most directly comparable GAAP equivalents, respectively, for the periods indicated below (unaudited):\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \nThe Farmer Mac Facility includes a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial covenants, including: a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 60%; a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.00, beginning after the second quarter of 2015; and a minimum tangible net worth. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2015. On August 3, 2015, we amended the Bond Purchase Agreement in order to calculate the fixed charge coverage ratio using our Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement) rather than our EBITDA (as defined in the Bond Purchase Agreement).\nOther income decreased by $45,654, or 31.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. During both periods other income was recognized on the sale of easements and right-of-way.\n \u00b7 Investment of $7,574,180 for real estate improvements during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $46,300 in 2014; and \nWhen we acquire a property in a business combination, we evaluate such acquisition for any related deferred tax assets or liabilities and determine if a deferred tax asset or liability should be recorded in conjunction with the purchase price allocation. If a built-in gain is acquired, we evaluate the required holding period (generally 5-10 years) and determine if we have the ability and intent to hold the underlying assets for the necessary holding period. If we have the ability to hold the underlying assets for the required holding period, no deferred tax liability will be recorded with respect to the built-in gain.\n2015 Completed Acquisitions\nOn April 1, 2015, the TRS and Hough Farms entered into a custom farming arrangement, pursuant to which Hough Farms will perform custom farming on 563 acres. Additionally, the TRS plans to operate a volume purchasing program for participating tenants by working with suppliers to pool tenant purchasing abilities and create cost savings through bulk orders. This volume purchasing program is currently operated by the Company on a limited trial basis.\n\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; \n \u00b7 Increase in costs as a result of becoming a public company of $839,691; \nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Adjusted Funds from Operations ( AFFO\u201d)\nInterest Rates\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08\u201d). Under this revised guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations, such as a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business or a major equity method investment, will be presented as discontinued operations. The standard requires prospective application and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014 with early adoption permitted. The early adoption provision excludes components of an entity that were sold or classified as held for sale prior to the adoption of the standard. We elected to early adopt this standard effective January 1, 2014. Because there were no dispositions for the year ended December 31, 2014 and guidance is applied prospectively, there was no impact to our statements of operations or financial position.\n \u00b7 Issuance five bonds totaling $81,100,100 under the Farmer Mac Facility. \nProperties under Contract\nour business operating performance because it includes non-cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand our business operating performance. Therefore, in addition to EBITDA, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth in the table below.\nWe evaluate our tangible and identifiable intangible real estate assets for impairment indicators whenever events such as declines in a property's operating performance, deteriorating market conditions, or environmental or legal concerns bring recoverability of the carrying value of one or more assets into question. If such events are present, we project the total undiscounted cash flows of the asset, including proceeds from disposition, and compare it to the net book value of the asset. If this evaluation indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in earnings equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There have been no impairments recognized on real estate assets in the accompanying financial statements.\nOverview and Background\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased approximately $156,631,445 primarily as a result of the following:\nReal Estate\nDuring 2015, we completed 26 acquisitions, bringing the total to 56 acquisitions since the IPO. The 2015 acquisitions are described in further detail below. The 2015 acquisitions expanded our presence to four new states, bringing our total presence to twelve states. We also started acquiring permanent specialty crop farms.\nCrop Prices\nTenant reimbursements include reimbursements for real estate taxes that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its lease. When leases require that the tenant reimburse us for property taxes paid by us, the reimbursement is reflected as tenant reimbursement revenue on the statements of operations, as earned, and the related property tax as property operating expense, as incurred. When a lease requires that the tenant pay the taxing authority directly, we do not incur this cost. If and when it becomes probable that a tenant will not be able to bear the property-related costs, we will accrue the estimated expense.\nRecent Developments\nannual rent is payable in advance of each spring planting season mitigates the tenant credit risk associated with the variability of farming operations that could be adversely impacted by poor crop yields, weather conditions, mismanagement, undercapitalization or other factors affecting our tenants. Prior to acquiring farmland property, we take into consideration the competitiveness of the local farm-operator tenant environment in order to enhance our ability to quickly replace a tenant that is unwilling to renew a lease or is unable to pay a rent payment when it is due. Some of our leases provide for a reimbursement of the property taxes we pay. We expect that, going forward, a progressively smaller percentage of our leases will provide for such a reimbursement.\nOur exposure to short-term crop price declines is limited. The lease agreements with some of our tenants provide for a rent determined as a percentage of the farm's gross proceeds, but even in those cases our downside is generally limited by crop insurance, hedging, or a minimum cash rent. In addition, the impact of weaker crop prices is often offset by the higher crop yields that generally accompany lower crop prices.\nTotal consideration for acquisitions may include a combination of cash and equity securities. When equity securities are issued, we determine the fair value of the equity securities issued based on the number of shares of common stock and OP units issued multiplied by the stock price on the date of closing in the case of common stock and OP units, and on liquidation preference in the case of Preferred Units.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nInterest expense increased by $29,868, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of an increase in interest related to the Farmer Mac Facility of $238,933 and an increase in the amortization of deferred financing fees of $80,392, which was offset by interest savings of $268,545 as a result of repaying $12.2 million in outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2014, we had $81.1 million outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional farmland and make other investments consistent with our investment strategy, make principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, make distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT and fund our operations. Our sources of funds primarily will be cash on hand, operating cash flows and borrowings from prospective lenders.\n \u00b7 Payments of $238,711 in financing fees made during 2015, as compared to $369,528 in payments during 2014; \n \u00b7 Receipt of $300,000 of refund related to certain of our mortgage notes payable during 2015; and \nNew or Revised Accounting Standards\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nContractual Obligations\nRental Revenues\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ended December 31, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay any outstanding borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and to OP unitholders, and other general business needs.\nWe were incorporated in Maryland on September 27, 2013, and we are the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, which is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed on September 27, 2013. All of our assets are held by, and our operations are primarily conducted through, the Operating Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. As of the date of this Annual Report we own 64% of the common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( OP units\u201d) and none of the Series A preferred units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( Preferred Units\u201d). See Note 9 to our combined consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Preferred Units.\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nGain on sale of easement was $144,020 for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, the Company entered into a transmission easement with a power company in Illinois for $144,020.\nWe expect that future changes in interest rates will impact our overall operating performance by, among other things, increasing our borrowing costs. While we may seek to manage our exposure to future changes in rates through interest rate swap agreements or interest rate caps, portions of our overall outstanding debt will likely remain at floating rates. In addition, a sustained material increase in interest rates may cause farmland prices to decline if the rise in real interest rates (which is defined as nominal interest rates minus the inflation rate) is not accompanied by rises in the general levels of inflation. However, our business model anticipates that the value of our farmland will increase, as it has in the past, at a rate that is equal to or greater than the rate of inflation, which may in part offset the impact of rising interest rates on the value of our farmland, but there can be no guarantee that this appreciation will occur to the extent that we anticipate or at all.\nOur rental income for the periods presented was impacted by 29 acquisitions made during the year ended December 31, 2014 and one acquisition made during the year ended December 31, 2013. To highlight the effect of changes due to acquisitions, we have separately discussed the rental income for the same-property portfolio, which includes only properties owned and operated for the entirety of both periods presented. The same-property portfolio for the periods presented includes only the original farms which were contributed at the IPO date.\nOur ability to incur additional debt will depend on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets, borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders and the conditions of debt markets. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will depend on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOver the next twelve months, $84,750,000 of our borrowings will mature. To satisfy our maturing debt obligations, we intend to utilize a combination of our expected cash flow from operations, and proceeds from debt refinancings from prospective lenders and potential equity issuances. Any cash that we use to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations will\nconsultant, unconditionally agreed to jointly and severally guarantee $11,000,000 of the Operating Partnership's obligations under the FMW Loan Agreement. On February 24, 2015, we amended the FMW Loan Agreement to revise the financial covenants. On March 6, 2016, we amended the FMW Loan Agreement to extend its maturity by three months, to June 4, 2016, with respect to $26,000,000 of the currently outstanding principal.\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate related depreciation, depletion and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management presents FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance\n \u00b7 Receipt of $16,353,157 in cash rents for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to receiving $5,310,267 in cash rents in the same period of 2014; \nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) (\"ASU 2015-11\"). The amendments require that an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated sales price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn connection with the Bond Purchase Agreement, we and the Operating Partnership are also party to the Amended and Restated Pledge and Security agreement, dated as of March 1, 2015 (the Pledge Agreement\u201d) in favor of the Purchaser and Farmer Mac, pursuant to which we and the Operating Partnership agreed to pledge, as collateral for the Farmer Mac Facility, all of their respective right, title and interest in (i) mortgage loans with a value at least equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding bond held by the Purchaser and (ii) such additional collateral as necessary to have total collateral with a value at least equal to 110% of the outstanding notes held by the Purchaser. In addition, we agreed to guarantee the full performance of the Operating Partnership's duties and obligations under the Pledge Agreement.\n \u00b7 Acquiring 49 farms in 2014 for aggregate

acquisitions in 2015 for $109 million and 29 acquisitions in 2014 for $126 million. This has expanded their presence to 12 states and increased their specialty crop holdings. \n\n- Rental income increased 69% in 2014 and 241% in 2015 compared to the prior years, driven by acquisitions. Same-property rental income increased 11% in 2014 and decreased slightly in 2015.\n\n- Net income was $1.7 million in 2015, compared to a loss of $0.7 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher rental revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by higher interest costs.\n\n- The company has $84.8 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months. They plan to use cash flow from operations, debt refinancing, and potential equity issuances to satisfy the maturing debt. \n\n- Key non-GAAP metrics are FFO, AFFO, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA. These are used to evaluate operating performance adjusted for various factors like non-cash expenses.\n\n- The report discusses the company's exposure to crop prices, interest rates, liquidity and capital resources, and new accounting standards. It also provides details on their rental revenue, expenses, cash flows, contractual obligations, and financing activities.\n\nIn summary, the MD&A analyzes the company's 2015 financial performance, debt obligations, operating metrics, market conditions, and future outlook. The key factors are acquisitions driving growth, debt refinancing needs, and the impacts of crop prices and interest rates."}
