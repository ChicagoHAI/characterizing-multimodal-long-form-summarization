Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is July 31. Our fiscal quarters end on October 31, January 31, April 30 and July 31. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors\" or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See also \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" above.\nOverview\nNutanix, Inc. (\"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" or \"Nutanix\") provides a leading enterprise cloud platform that consists of software solutions that power many of the world's business applications by digitizing the traditional silos of enterprise computing. We seek to provide an enterprise cloud platform that empowers our customers to unify various clouds - private, public, distributed - into one seamless cloud, allowing enterprises to choose the right cloud for each application. Our enterprise cloud platform natively converges compute, virtualization, storage, networking, desktop and security services into one integrated, simple to consume solution, which allows enterprises to simplify the complexities of a multi-cloud environment with automation, cost governance and compliance.\nOur enterprise cloud platform can be deployed on a variety of qualified hardware platforms or, in the case of our cloud-based software and software as a service (\"SaaS\") offerings, via hosted service or delivered pre-installed on an appliance that is configured to order. Non-portable software is delivered or sold alongside configured-to-order appliances with a license term equal to the life of the associated appliance. Our subscription term-based licenses are sold separately, or can be sold alongside configured-to-order appliances. Configured-to-order appliances, including our Nutanix-branded NX hardware line, can be purchased from one of our channel partners, original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") or directly from Nutanix. Our enterprise cloud platform is typically purchased with one or more years of support and entitlements, which includes the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support.\nProduct revenue is generated primarily from the licensing of our solutions. Support, entitlements and other services revenue is primarily derived from the related support and maintenance contracts. Prior to fiscal 2019, we delivered most of our solutions on an appliance, thus our revenue included the revenue associated with the appliance and the included non-portable software, which lasts for the life of the associated appliance. However, starting in fiscal 2018, as a result of our business model transition toward software-only sales, more of our customers began buying appliances directly from our OEMs while separately buying licenses for our software solutions from us or one of our channel partners. In addition, starting in fiscal 2019, as a result of our transition towards a subscription-based business model, more of our customers began purchasing separately sold subscription term-based licenses that could be deployed on a variety of hardware platforms. As we continue our transition to a subscription-based business model, we expect a greater portion of our products to be delivered through subscription term-based licenses or cloud-based SaaS subscriptions.\nWe had a broad and diverse base of approximately 14,180 end customers as of July 31, 2019, including approximately 810 Global 2000 enterprises. We define the number of end customers as the number of end customers for which we have received an order by the last day of the period, excluding partners to which we have sold products for their own demonstration purposes. A single organization or customer may represent multiple end customers for separate divisions, segments or subsidiaries. Since shipping our first product in fiscal 2012, our end customer base has grown rapidly. The number of end customers grew from approximately 10,610 as of July 31, 2018 to approximately 14,180 as of July 31, 2019.\nOur solutions are primarily sold through channel partners, including distributors, resellers and OEMs, and delivered directly to our end customers. Our solutions serve a broad range of workloads, including enterprise applications, databases, virtual desktop infrastructure, unified communications and big data analytics, and we support both virtualized and container-based applications. We have end customers across a broad range of industries, such as automotive, consumer goods, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing,\nNUTANIX, INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nmedia, public sector, retail, technology and telecommunications. We also sell to service providers, who utilize our enterprise cloud platform to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers.\nWe continue to invest heavily in the growth of our business, including the development of our solutions, build-out of our global sales force, projects to increase the demand for our solutions and other sales and marketing initiatives. The number of our full-time employees increased from approximately 4,010 as of July 31, 2018 to approximately 5,340 as of July 31, 2019. We have an engineering team focused on distributed systems and IT infrastructure technologies at our San Jose, California headquarters and at our research and development centers in India, North Carolina, Washington, Serbia and Germany. We have also expanded our international sales and marketing presence by continuing to build out our global teams and continuing to invest in sales and marketing initiatives, such as additional demand generation spending to increase pipeline growth. We intend to continue to invest in our global engineering team to enhance the functionality of our enterprise cloud platform, including our newer subscription-based products, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership, as well as continue to expand our global sales and marketing teams.\nOur total revenue was $845.9 million, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing increases of 36.6% and 7.0% in fiscal 2018 and 2019, as compared to the respective prior year periods. Our software and support revenue was $609.6 million, $898.1 million and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing increases of 47.3% and 25.9% in fiscal 2018 and 2019, as compared to the respective prior year periods. Our subscription revenue was $172.5 million, $330.6 million and $648.4 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing increases of 91.6% and 96.1% in fiscal 2018 and 2019, as compared to the respective prior year periods.\nOur net losses were $379.6 million, $297.2 million and $621.2 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was $14.8 million, $92.5 million and $42.2 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Free cash flow, which is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, was an outflow of $35.4 million for fiscal 2017, an inflow of $30.2 million for fiscal 2018 and an outflow of $76.3 million for fiscal 2019. As of July 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nKey Financial

The software licenses associated with these sales are typically non-portable and have a term equal to the life of the appliance on which the software is delivered. Revenue from our non-portable software products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.\nHardware - In transactions where we deliver the hardware appliance, we consider ourselves to be the principal in the transaction and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We consider the amount allocated to hardware revenue to be equivalent to the cost of the hardware procured. Hardware revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.\nProfessional services - We also sell professional services with our products. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures\nWe regularly monitor total billings, subscription billings, professional services billings, software and support billings, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses, which are non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures, to help us evaluate our growth and operational efficiencies, measure our performance, identify trends in our sales activity and establish our budgets. We evaluate these measures because they:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>are used by management and the Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our performance and trends, as well as to provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>are widely used as a measure of financial performance to understand and evaluate companies in our industry; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>are used by management to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational and compensation plans, as well as to assess our actual performance against our goals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Total billings, subscription billings, professional services billings and software and support billings are performance measures which management believes provide useful information to investors, as they represent the dollar value under binding purchase orders received and billed during a given period. Free cash flow is a performance measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash used in or generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. Adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and non-GAAP operating expenses are performance measures which management believes provide useful information to investors, as they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures, such as stock-based compensation expense, that may not be indicative of our ongoing core business operating results. We use these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nTotal billings, subscription billings, professional services billings, software and support billings, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses have limitations as analytical tools and they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Total billings, subscription billings, professional services billings, software and support billings, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses are not substitutes for total revenue, subscription revenue, professional services revenue, software and support revenue, gross profit, gross margin, cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or GAAP operating expenses, respectively. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison. We urge you to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nWe calculate our non-GAAP measures as follows:\nTotal billings - We calculate total billings by adding the change in deferred revenue, net of acquisitions, between the start and end of the period to total revenue recognized in the same period.\nSubscription billings- We calculate subscription billings by adding the change in subscription deferred revenue, net of acquisitions, between the start and end of the period to subscription revenue recognized in the same period.\nProfessional services billings- We calculate professional services billings by adding the change in professional services deferred revenue, net of acquisitions, between the start and end of the period to professional services revenue recognized in the same period.\nSoftware and support billings- We calculate software and support billings by adding the change in software and support deferred revenue, net of acquisitions, between the start and end of the period to software and support revenue recognized in the same period. Software and support revenue and billings include software and support, entitlements and other services revenue and billings.\nAdjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin - We calculate adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenue. We define adjusted gross profit as gross profit adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Our presentation of adjusted gross profit should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nFree cash flow - We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations after our capital expenditures.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses - We define non-GAAP operating expenses as total operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, costs associated with business combinations, such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, revaluation of contingent consideration and other acquisition-related costs and costs associated with other non-recurring transactions. Our presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nThe following table

future success will depend on many factors, including those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. See the section titled \"Risk Factors\" for details. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nInvestment in Growth\nWe plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing so that we can capitalize on our market opportunity, including growing our sales and marketing teams, continuing our focus on opportunities with major accounts and large deals, which we define as transactions over $500,000, expanding our focus on opportunities in commercial accounts, as well as other sales and marketing initiatives, such as additional demand generation spending to increase our pipeline growth. We have significantly increased our sales and marketing personnel, which grew by approximately 36% from July 31, 2018 to July 31, 2019. We estimate, based on past experience, that our average sales team members typically become fully ramped up around the start of their fourth quarter of employment with us, and as our newer employees ramp up, we expect their increased productivity to contribute to our revenue growth. As of July 31, 2019, we considered approximately 57% of our global sales team members to be fully ramped, while the remaining approximately 43% of our global sales team members are in the process of ramping up. As we continue to focus some of our new and existing sales team members on major accounts and large deals, and as we continue our transition toward a subscription-based business model, it may take longer, potentially significantly, for these sales team members to become fully productive, and there may also be an impact to the overall productivity of\nNUTANIX, INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nour sales team. We are focused on actively managing these realignments. We intend to continue to grow our global sales and marketing team and continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to acquire new end customers and to increase sales to existing end customers.\nWe also intend to continue to grow our global research and development and engineering teams to enhance our solutions, including our newer subscription-based products, improve integration with new and existing ecosystem partners and broaden the range of technologies and features available through our platform.\nWe believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may adversely affect our profitability in the near term.\nTransition to Subscription\nStarting in fiscal 2019, as a result of our transition towards a subscription-based business model, more of our customers began purchasing separately sold subscription term-based licenses that could be deployed on a variety of hardware platforms. As we continue our transition to a subscription-based business model, we expect a greater portion of our products to be delivered through subscription term-based licenses or cloud-based SaaS subscriptions. Shifts in the mix of whether our solutions are sold on a subscription basis could result in fluctuations in our billings and revenue. Subscription sales consist of subscription term-based licenses and offerings with ongoing performance obligations, including software entitlement and support subscriptions and cloud-based SaaS offerings. Since revenue is recognized as performance obligations are delivered, sales with ongoing performance obligations may reflect lower revenue in a given period. In addition, other factors relating to our shift to selling more subscription term-based licenses may impact our billings and revenue. For example, our term-based licenses generally have an average term of less than four years and thus result in lower billings and revenue in a given period when compared to our historical life of device license sales, which have a duration equal to the life of the associated appliance, which we estimate to be approximately five years.\nRevenue for our solutions, whether or not sold a subscription term-based license, is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer. For additional information on revenue recognition, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" later in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section.\nMarket Adoption of Our Products\nThe public cloud and more recently, hybrid cloud paradigms, have changed IT buyer expectations about the simplicity, agility, scalability, portability and pay-as-you-grow economics of IT resources, which represent a major architectural shift and business model evolution. A key focus of our sales and marketing efforts is creating market awareness about the benefits of our enterprise cloud platform, both as compared to traditional datacenter architectures as well as the public cloud, particularly as we continue to pursue large enterprises and mission critical workloads and transition toward a subscription-based business model. The broad nature of the technology shift that our enterprise cloud platform represents, the relationships our end customers have with existing IT vendors and our transition toward a subscription-based consumption model sometimes lead to unpredictable sales cycles, which we hope to compress and stabilize as market adoption increases, as we gain leverage with our channel partners, as we continue to educate the market about our subscription-based business model and as our sales and marketing efforts expand. Our business and operating results will be significantly affected by the degree to and speed with which organizations adopt our enterprise cloud platform.\nLeveraging Channel Partners and OEMs\nWe plan to continue to strengthen and expand our network of channel partners and OEMs to increase sales to both new and existing end customers. We believe that increasing channel leverage, particularly as we expand our focus on opportunities in commercial accounts, by investing aggressively in sales enablement and co-marketing with our partners and OEMs will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of end customers. Our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by our success in leveraging and expanding our network of channel partners and OEMs.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCustomer Retention and Expansion\nOur end customers typically deploy our technology for a specific workload initially. After a new end customer's initial order, which includes the product and associated software entitlement and support subscription and services, we focus on expanding our footprint by serving more workloads. We also generate recurring revenue from our software entitlement and support subscription renewals. We view continued purchases and upgrades as critical drivers of our success, as the sales cycles are typically shorter as compared to new end customer deployments, and selling efforts are typically less. As of July 31, 2019, approximately 65% of our end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer have made a repeat purchase, which is defined as any purchase activity, including renewals of term-based licenses or software entitlement and support subscription renewals, after the initial purchase. Additionally, end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer have total lifetime orders, including the initial order, in an amount that is more than 4.0x greater, or 4.4x greater excluding the value of hardware purchases, on average, than their initial order. This number increases to approximately 10.4x, or 11.7x excluding hardware, on average, for Global 2000 end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer as of July 31, 2019. These multiples exclude the effect of one end customer who had a very large and irregular purchase pattern that we believe is not representative of the purchase patterns of all of our other end customers.\nOur business and operating results will depend on our ability to retain and sell additional products to our existing and future base of end customers. Our ability to retain existing customers and expand our customer base will in turn depend in part on our ability to effectively maintain existing and future customer relationships, continue to innovate by adding new functionality and improving usability of our solutions in a manner that addresses our end customers' needs and requirements, and optimally price our solutions in light of marketplace conditions, competition, our costs and customer demand. Furthermore, our ongoing transition to a subscription-based business model may cause concerns among our customer base, including concerns regarding changes to pricing over time, and may also result in confusion among new and existing end customers, for example, regarding our pricing models. Such concerns and/or confusion can slow adoption and renewal rates among our current and future customer base. Therefore, as we continue our transition, we may need to enhance our efforts to educate our end customers and as a result incur higher sales and marketing costs.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of our enterprise cloud platform, which can be deployed on a variety of qualified hardware platforms or, in the case of our cloud-based SaaS offerings, via hosted service or delivered pre-installed on an appliance that is configured to order. Non-portable software is delivered or sold alongside configured-to-order appliances with a license term equal to the life of the associated appliance.\nOur subscription term-based licenses are sold separately, or can be sold alongside configured-to-order appliances. Our subscription term-based licenses typically have a term of one to five years. Our cloud-based SaaS subscriptions have terms extending up to five years.\nConfigured-to-order appliances, including our Nutanix-branded NX hardware line, can be purchased from one of our channel partners, OEMs or directly from Nutanix. Our enterprise cloud platform is typically purchased with one or more years of support and entitlements, which includes the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. Our platform is primarily sold through channel partners, including distributors, resellers and OEMs.\nProduct revenue - Product revenue consists of software and hardware revenue. A majority of our product revenue is generated from the sale of our enterprise cloud operating system. We also sell renewals of previously purchased software licenses and SaaS offerings. Revenue from our software products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is typically upon shipment for sales including a hardware appliance, upon making the software available to the customer when not sold with an appliance or as services are performed with SaaS offerings. In transactions where we deliver the hardware appliance, we consider ourselves to be the principal in the transaction and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We consider the amount allocated to hardware revenue to be equivalent to the cost of the hardware procured. Hardware revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nSupport, entitlements and other services revenue - We generate our support, entitlements and other services revenue primarily from software entitlement and support subscriptions, which include the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. The majority of our product sales are sold in conjunction with software entitlement and support subscriptions, with terms ranging from one to five years. Occasionally, we also sell professional services with our products. We recognize revenue from software entitlement and support contracts ratably over the contractual service period. The service period typically commences upon transfer of control of the corresponding products to the customer. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of product revenue - Cost of product revenue consists of costs paid to third-party contract manufacturers, hardware costs, personnel costs associated with our operations function, consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, cloud-based costs associated with our SaaS offerings, and allocated costs, consisting of certain facilities, depreciation and amortization, recruiting and information technology costs allocated based on headcount.\nCost of support, entitlements and other services revenue - Cost of support, entitlements and other services revenue includes personnel and operating costs associated with our global customer support organization, as well as allocated costs. We expect our cost of support, entitlements and other services revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our support, entitlements and other services revenue increases.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions.\nSales and marketing - Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Sales and marketing expense also includes sales commissions, costs for promotional activities and other marketing costs, travel costs and costs associated with demonstration units, including depreciation and allocated costs. Commissions are deferred and recognized as we recognize the associated revenue. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our global sales and marketing organizations. Sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nResearch and development - Research and development (\"R&D\") expense consists primarily of personnel costs, as well as other direct and allocated costs. We have devoted our product development efforts primarily to enhancing the functionality and expanding the capabilities of our solutions. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. We expect R&D expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, including our newer subscription-based products, although R&D expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nGeneral and administrative - General and administrative (\"G&A\") expense consists primarily of personnel costs, which include our executive, finance, human resources and legal organizations. G&A expense also includes outside professional services, which consists primarily of legal, accounting and other consulting costs, as well as insurance and other costs associated with being a public company and allocated costs. We expect G&A expense to increase in absolute dollars, particularly due to additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs associated with our growth, although G&A expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income and expense, which includes the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs associated with our 0% Convertible Senior Notes, due in 2023 (the \"Notes\"), interest income related to our short-term investments and foreign currency exchange gains or losses. During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, we recognized $14.7 million and $29.3 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs associated with the Notes.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes for certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and state income taxes in the United States. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our federal and state net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance related to our foreign net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years presented.

In addition, our product revenue has been impacted by our continued transition to selling subscription term-based licenses, as these licenses generally have an average term of less than four years, while those with a duration equal to the life of the associated appliance have an estimated life of approximately five years.

For fiscal 2018, as compared to the respective prior year period, cost of product revenue was impacted by increases in the cost of certain of our hardware components, specifically DRAM and NAND, due to supply constraints. The total cost of our DRAM and NAND components represented approximately 22% and 30% of cost of product revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. DRAM and NAND component prices increased by approximately 51% for fiscal 2018, as compared to the prior year period. For fiscal 2019, as compared to the respective prior year period, the decrease in cost of product revenue was due primarily to our continued focus on software-only transactions, which have a higher margin as compared to hardware sales.\nProduct gross margin increased by 5.9 percentage points, from 63.0% in fiscal 2017 to 68.9% in fiscal 2018, and by 13.9 percentage points, to 82.8% in fiscal 2019, due primarily to the higher mix of software revenue, as we continue to focus on more software-only transactions.\nCost of support, entitlements and other services revenue\nCost of support, entitlements and other services revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher personnel-related costs relating to the expansion of our global customer support organization. The increases in personnel-related costs were due primarily to increases in our customer support, entitlements and other services headcount of 56% from July 31, 2017 to July 31, 2018 and 40% from July 31, 2018 to July 31, 2019.\nSupport, entitlements and other services gross margin increased by 4.1 percentage points, from 54.8% in fiscal 2017 to 58.9% in fiscal 2018, and by 1.2 percentage points to 60.1% in fiscal 2019, due primarily to efficiencies gained in our support organization and personnel-related costs growing at a slower rate than support, entitlements and other services revenue, as well as the ramp up for new products, specifically cloud services.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>649,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>649,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>909,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of total revenue\n</td> <td>59.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher personnel-related costs and sales commissions, as our sales and marketing headcount increased year-over-year by 42% in fiscal 2018 and 36% in fiscal 2019.

We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance related to our foreign net deferred tax assets.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), which includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses. For additional details, refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of July 31, 2019, we had $396.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 million of restricted cash and $512.2 million of short-term investments, which were held for general corporate purposes. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments primarily consist of bank deposits, money market accounts and highly rated debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies and debt instruments of highly rated corporations. We do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations.\nIn January 2018, we issued Convertible Senior Notes with a 0% interest rate for an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. There are no required principal payments prior to the maturity of the Notes. For additional information, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(176,094\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(503,555\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,850\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>201,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>578,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents, effective August 1, 2018.

The generation of cash during each fiscal year was due primarily to higher billings and collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $176.1 million for fiscal 2017 primarily consisted of $242.5 million of short-term investment purchases, using a significant portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), and $50.2 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $84.2 million of maturities of short-term investments and $32.6 million of sales of short-term investments.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $503.6 million for fiscal 2018 primarily consisted of $716.4 million of

of short-term investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $201.4 million for fiscal 2017 primarily consisted of net IPO proceeds of $254.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and $32.3 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by the $76.6 million of repayment of senior notes in September 2016, including debt extinguishment costs, a $7.1 million debt payment in conjunction with a business combination and $1.7 million in payments for IPO costs.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $578.6 million for fiscal 2018 primarily consisted of $563.6 million of net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and debt issuance costs, $88.0 million of proceeds from the sale of the warrants in connection with the Notes and $72.0 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity

cash provided by financing activities of $67.1 million for fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of $69.2 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially

related to our above outstanding non-cancelable lease obligations will be made through fiscal 2026.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of business, we make commitments with our contract manufacturers and OEMs to ensure them a minimum level of financial consideration for their investment in our joint solutions. These commitments are based on revenue targets or on-hand inventory and non-cancelable purchase orders for non-standard components. We record a charge related to these items when we determine that it is probable a loss will be incurred and we are able to estimate the amount of the loss. Our historical charges have not been material.\nAs of July 31, 2019, we had $15.8 million of accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. These accrued liabilities are not reflected in the contractual obligations disclosed in the table above, as it is uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled. Uncertain tax positions are further discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of July 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nRevenue Recognition\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. For deliverables that we routinely sell separately, such as software entitlement and support subscriptions on our core offerings, we determine SSP by evaluating the standalone sales over the trailing 12 months. For those that are not sold routinely, we determine SSP based on our overall pricing trends and objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the products sold and geographic locations.\nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP. We determine SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the SSP is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the SSP, taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on revenue recognition.\nIncome Taxes\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nThe TCJA significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included and continues to include numerous provisions that affect our business. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including stock options and purchase rights issued to employees under our 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"2016 ESPP\"), based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton (\"Black-Scholes\") option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options and 2016 ESPP purchase rights. The fair value of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), is measured using the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock options and RSUs is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years. For stock-based awards granted to employees with a performance condition, we recognize stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period when management determines it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. The fair value of the 2016 ESPP purchase rights is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period. We account for forfeitures of all share-based awards when they occur.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent\nNUTANIX, INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nuncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our acquisitions using the acquisition method. Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities. Although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities obtained during the measurement period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of such assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.\nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that we are within the one-year measurement period.\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessment\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, in a business combination, and is allocated to our single reporting unit. We review our goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. We operate under one reporting unit and for our annual goodwill impairment test, we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our enterprise value. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment analysis will be performed. We will compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount and if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized.\nAssessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. Therefore, there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets impairment tests. To date, we have not recorded any impairment charges related to our goodwill and intangible assets.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Hardware - In transactions where we deliver the hardware appliance, we consider ourselves to be the principal in the transaction and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.

Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP. We determine SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the SSP is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the SSP, taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.

Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities obtained during the measurement period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of such assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.\nBusiness Combinations\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>649,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>649,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>909,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of total revenue\n</td> <td>59.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur solutions are primarily sold through channel partners, including distributors, resellers and OEMs, and delivered directly to our end customers.

We urge you to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of and for the Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>845,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,155,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,236,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year-over-year percentage increase\n</td> <td>68.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>648,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software and support revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>609,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>898,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,130,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total billings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,417,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,514,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription billings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>311,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>581,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>916,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software and support billings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>754,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,160,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,409,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>518,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>769,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>932,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>533,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>786,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>965,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>61.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted gross margin\n</td> <td>63.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deferred revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>369,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>631,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>910,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,402\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(76,284\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>883,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,239,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total end customers\n</td> <td>7,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continue to invest heavily in the growth of our business, including the development of our solutions, build-out of our global sales force, projects to increase the demand for our solutions and other sales and marketing initiatives.

measures, to help us evaluate our growth and operational efficiencies, measure our performance, identify trends in our sales activity and establish our budgets. We evaluate these measures because they:\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, in a business combination, and is allocated to our single reporting unit. We review our goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. We operate under one reporting unit and for our annual goodwill impairment test, we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our enterprise value. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment analysis will be performed. We will compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount and if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of July 31, 2019:\nKey Financial and Performance Metrics\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended July 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>488,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>648,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>648,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>682,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>186,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe, the Middle East and Africa\n</td> <td>138,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Americas\n</td> <td>32,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>845,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,155,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,155,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,236,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nThe year-over-year fluctuations in cost of product revenue are in line with the corresponding fluctuations in hardware revenue. For fiscal 2018, as compared to the respective prior year period, cost of product revenue was impacted by increases in the cost of certain of our hardware components, specifically DRAM and NAND, due to supply constraints. The total cost of our DRAM and NAND components represented approximately 22% and 30% of cost of product revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. DRAM and NAND component prices increased by approximately 51% for fiscal 2018, as compared to the prior year period. For fiscal 2019, as compared to the respective prior year period, the decrease in cost of product revenue was due primarily to our continued focus on software-only transactions, which have a higher margin as compared to hardware sales.\nSales and marketing expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher personnel-related costs and sales commissions, as our sales and marketing headcount increased year-over-year by 42% in fiscal 2018 and 36% in fiscal 2019. Additionally, as part of our continued efforts to penetrate and expand in global markets and increase our pipeline growth through additional demand generation, we continue to increase our sales and marketing activities related to brand awareness, promotions, trade shows and partner programs. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase as we continue to grow.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nRefer to \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nProduct gross margin increased by 5.9 percentage points, from 63.0% in fiscal 2017 to 68.9% in fiscal 2018, and by 13.9 percentage points, to 82.8% in fiscal 2019, due primarily to the higher mix of software revenue, as we continue to focus on more software-only transactions.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nOur net losses were $379.6 million, $297.2 million and $621.2 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was $14.8 million, $92.5 million and $42.2 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Free cash flow, which is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, was an outflow of $35.4 million for fiscal 2017, an inflow of $30.2 million for fiscal 2018 and an outflow of $76.3 million for fiscal 2019. As of July 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion.\nWe believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. See the section titled \"Risk Factors\" for details. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nIn January 2018, we issued Convertible Senior Notes with a 0% interest rate for an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. There are no required principal payments prior to the maturity of the Notes. For additional information, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSupport, entitlements and other services revenue - We generate our support, entitlements and other services revenue primarily from software entitlement and support subscriptions, which include the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. The majority of our product sales are sold in conjunction with software entitlement and support subscriptions, with terms ranging from one to five years. Occasionally, we also sell professional services with our products. We recognize revenue from software entitlement and support contracts ratably over the contractual service period. The service period typically commences upon transfer of control of the corresponding products to the customer. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed.\nMarket Adoption of Our Products\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nOverview\nOur enterprise cloud platform can be deployed on a variety of qualified hardware platforms or, in the case of our cloud-based software and software as a service (\"SaaS\") offerings, via hosted service or delivered pre-installed on an appliance that is configured to order. Non-portable software is delivered or sold alongside configured-to-order appliances with a license term equal to the life of the associated appliance. Our subscription term-based licenses are sold separately, or can be sold alongside configured-to-order appliances. Configured-to-order appliances, including our Nutanix-branded NX hardware line, can be purchased from one of our channel partners, original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") or directly from Nutanix. Our enterprise cloud platform is typically purchased with one or more years of support and entitlements, which includes the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support.\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $201.4 million for fiscal 2017 primarily consisted of net IPO proceeds of $254.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and $32.3 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by the $76.6 million of repayment of senior notes in September 2016, including debt extinguishment costs, a $7.1 million debt payment in conjunction with a business combination and $1.7 million in payments for IPO costs.\nCost of product revenue - Cost of product revenue consists of costs paid to third-party contract manufacturers, hardware costs, personnel costs associated with our operations function, consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, cloud-based costs associated with our SaaS offerings, and allocated costs, consisting of certain facilities, depreciation and amortization, recruiting and information technology costs allocated based on headcount.\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of our enterprise cloud platform, which can be deployed on a variety of qualified hardware platforms or, in the case of our cloud-based SaaS offerings, via hosted service or delivered pre-installed on an appliance that is configured to order. Non-portable software is delivered or sold alongside configured-to-order appliances with a license term equal to the life of the associated appliance.\nConfigured-to-order appliances, including our Nutanix-branded NX hardware line, can be purchased from one of our channel partners, OEMs or directly from Nutanix. Our enterprise cloud platform is typically purchased with one or more years of support and entitlements, which includes the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. Our platform is primarily sold through channel partners, including distributors, resellers and OEMs.\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. For deliverables that we routinely sell separately, such as software entitlement and support subscriptions on our core offerings, we determine SSP by evaluating the standalone sales over the trailing 12 months. For those that are not sold routinely, we determine SSP based on our overall pricing trends and objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the products sold and geographic locations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 are used by management to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational and compensation plans, as well as to assess our actual performance against our goals.  Total billings, subscription billings, professional services billings and software and support billings are performance measures which management believes provide useful information to investors, as they represent the dollar value under binding purchase orders received and billed during a given period. Free cash flow is a performance measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash used in or generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. Adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and non-GAAP operating expenses are performance measures which management believes provide useful information to investors, as they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures, such as stock-based compensation expense, that may not be indicative of our ongoing core business operating results. We use these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.\nSoftware and support billings- We calculate software and support billings by adding the change in software and support deferred revenue, net of acquisitions, between the start and end of the period to software and support revenue recognized in the same period. Software and support revenue and billings include software and support, entitlements and other services revenue and billings.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNet cash used in investing activities of $16.9 million for fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of $468.1 million of short-term investment purchases, $118.5 million of purchases of property and equipment and $19.0 million of net payments for business combinations, partially offset by $588.8 million of maturities of short-term investments.\n \u2022 Upfront - Revenue from our subscription software licenses is generally recognized upfront upon transfer of control to the customer, which happens when we make the software available to the customer. These subscription software licenses represented approximately $15.9 million, $86.7 million and $272.0 million of our subscription revenue for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. For fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, the weighted average term for these subscription term-based licenses was approximately 2.9 years, 3.7 years and 3.8 years, respectively.  Non-portable software - Non-portable software revenue includes sales of our enterprise cloud platform when delivered on a configured-to-order appliance by us or one of our OEM partners. The software licenses associated with these sales are typically non-portable and have a term equal to the life of the appliance on which the software is delivered. Revenue from our non-portable software products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.\nWe plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing so that we can capitalize on our market opportunity, including growing our sales and marketing teams, continuing our focus on opportunities with major accounts and large deals, which we define as transactions over $500,000, expanding our focus on opportunities in commercial accounts, as well as other sales and marketing initiatives, such as additional demand generation spending to increase our pipeline growth. We have significantly increased our sales and marketing personnel, which grew by approximately 36% from July 31, 2018 to July 31, 2019. We estimate, based on past experience, that our average sales team members typically become fully ramped up around the start of their fourth quarter of employment with us, and as our newer employees ramp up, we expect their increased productivity to contribute to our revenue growth. As of July 31, 2019, we considered approximately 57% of our global sales team members to be fully ramped, while the remaining approximately 43% of our global sales team members are in the process of ramping up. As we continue to focus some of our new and existing sales team members on major accounts and large deals, and as we continue our transition toward a subscription-based business model, it may take longer, potentially significantly, for these sales team members to become fully productive, and there may also be an impact to the overall productivity of\nuncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nRevenue\nWe retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents, effective August 1, 2018. Our statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 has been adjusted to conform to the new standard. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on this new standard.\nFree cash flow - We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations after our capital expenditures.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nOperating Expenses\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\n (2) Includes amortization of intangible assets as follows: \nTotal billings - We calculate total billings by adding the change in deferred revenue, net of acquisitions, between the start and end of the period to total revenue recognized in the same period.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses - We define non-GAAP operating expenses as total operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, costs associated with business combinations, such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, revaluation of contingent consideration and other acquisition-related costs and costs associated with other non-recurring transactions. Our presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income and expense, which includes the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs associated with our 0% Convertible Senior Notes, due in 2023 (the \"Notes\"), interest income related to our short-term investments and foreign currency exchange gains or losses. During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, we recognized $14.7 million and $29.3 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs associated with the Notes.\nProfessional services - We also sell professional services with our products. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNUTANIX, INC.\nCost of support, entitlements and other services revenue - Cost of support, entitlements and other services revenue includes personnel and operating costs associated with our global customer support organization, as well as allocated costs. We expect our cost of support, entitlements and other services revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our support, entitlements and other services revenue increases.\n\n (2) Excludes deferred revenue assumed in acquisitions of approximately $6.0 million, $0.1 million and $0.3 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

As of July 31, 2019, payments related to our above outstanding non-cancelable lease obligations will be made through fiscal 2026.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCost of product revenue\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\n \u2022 Ratable - We recognize revenue from software entitlement and support subscriptions and SaaS offerings ratably over the contractual service period, the substantial majority of which relate to software entitlement and support subscriptions. These offerings represented approximately $156.6 million, $243.9 million and $376.4 million of our subscription revenue for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCustomer Retention and Expansion\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\n\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nProduct revenue increased year-over-year for fiscal 2018 due primarily to increased domestic and international demand for our solutions through penetration and expansion in global markets through increased sales and marketing activities. Our product revenue during fiscal 2018 was also impacted by the reduction of hardware revenue from transactions where the hardware was not sold by us.\nOur business and operating results will depend on our ability to retain and sell additional products to our existing and future base of end customers. Our ability to retain existing customers and expand our customer base will in turn depend in part on our ability to effectively maintain existing and future customer relationships, continue to innovate by adding new functionality and improving usability of our solutions in a manner that addresses our end customers' needs and requirements, and optimally price our solutions in light of marketplace conditions, competition, our costs and customer demand. Furthermore, our ongoing transition to a subscription-based business model may cause concerns among our customer base, including concerns regarding changes to pricing over time, and may also result in confusion among new and existing end customers, for example, regarding our pricing models. Such concerns and/or confusion can slow adoption and renewal rates among our current and future customer base. Therefore, as we continue our transition, we may need to enhance our efforts to educate our end customers and as a result incur higher sales and marketing costs.\nProduct revenue is generated primarily from the licensing of our solutions. Support, entitlements and other services revenue is primarily derived from the related support and maintenance contracts. Prior to fiscal 2019, we delivered most of our solutions on an appliance, thus our revenue included the revenue associated with the appliance and the included non-portable software, which lasts for the life of the associated appliance. However, starting in fiscal 2018, as a result of our business model transition toward software-only sales, more of our customers began buying appliances directly from our OEMs while separately buying licenses for our software solutions from us or one of our channel partners. In addition, starting in fiscal 2019, as a result of our transition towards a subscription-based business model, more of our customers began purchasing separately sold subscription term-based licenses that could be deployed on a variety of hardware platforms. As we continue our transition to a subscription-based business model, we expect a greater portion of our products to be delivered through subscription term-based licenses or cloud-based SaaS subscriptions.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nTotal revenue by bill-to-location was as follows:\nAssessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. Therefore, there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets impairment tests. To date, we have not recorded any impairment charges related to our goodwill and intangible assets.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nProduct revenue decreased year-over-year for fiscal 2019 due primarily to the reduction of hardware revenue from transactions where the hardware was not sold by us. In addition, our product revenue has been impacted by our continued transition to selling subscription term-based licenses, as these licenses generally have an average term of less than four years, while those with a duration equal to the life of the associated appliance have an estimated life of approximately five years. We continue to focus on more software-only transactions and therefore anticipate selling less hardware in future periods.\nAs of July 31, 2019, we had $15.8 million of accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. These accrued liabilities are not reflected in the contractual obligations disclosed in the table above, as it is uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled. Uncertain tax positions are further discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales and marketing - Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Sales and marketing expense also includes sales commissions, costs for promotional activities and other marketing costs, travel costs and costs associated with demonstration units, including depreciation and allocated costs. Commissions are deferred and recognized as we recognize the associated revenue. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our global sales and marketing organizations. Sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nThe fluctuations in other expense, net for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 were primarily related to the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs for the Notes, as the Notes were issued during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as interest earned on short-term investments. The decrease in other expense, net for fiscal 2018 was also due to $23.1 million of expense in fiscal 2017 related to changes in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\n\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nOperating Expenses\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nNUTANIX, INC.\nmedia, public sector, retail, technology and telecommunications. We also sell to service providers, who utilize our enterprise cloud platform to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers.\nThe year-over-year increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2018 was due primarily to the alternative minimum tax related to the migration of certain intangible assets and foreign taxes as a result of higher taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions, as we continued our global expansion. The increase was partially offset by a $3.9 million partial release of the U.S. valuation allowance related to acquisitions completed during fiscal 2018.\nAs of July 31, 2019, we had $396.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 million of restricted cash and $512.2 million of short-term investments, which were held for general corporate purposes. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments primarily consist of bank deposits, money market accounts and highly rated debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies and debt instruments of highly rated corporations. We do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations.\nCost of support, entitlements and other services revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher personnel-related costs relating to the expansion of our global customer support organization. The increases in personnel-related costs were due primarily to increases in our customer support, entitlements and other services headcount of 56% from July 31, 2017 to July 31, 2018 and 40% from July 31, 2018 to July 31, 2019.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of total billings, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated:\nCost of Revenue\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nIn December 2017, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), which includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses.

We are focused on actively managing these realignments. We intend to continue to grow our global sales and marketing team and continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to acquire new end customers and to increase sales to existing end customers.\nOur end customers typically deploy our technology for a specific workload initially. After a new end customer's initial order, which includes the product and associated software entitlement and support subscription and services, we focus on expanding our footprint by serving more workloads. We also generate recurring revenue from our software entitlement and support subscription renewals. We view continued purchases and upgrades as critical drivers of our success, as the sales cycles are typically shorter as compared to new end customer deployments, and selling efforts are typically less. As of July 31, 2019, approximately 65% of our end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer have made a repeat purchase, which is defined as any purchase activity, including renewals of term-based licenses or software entitlement and support subscription renewals, after the initial purchase. Additionally, end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer have total lifetime orders, including the initial order, in an amount that is more than 4.0x greater, or 4.4x greater excluding the value of hardware purchases, on average, than their initial order. This number increases to approximately 10.4x, or 11.7x excluding hardware, on average, for Global 2000 end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer as of July 31, 2019. These multiples exclude the effect of one end customer who had a very large and irregular purchase pattern that we believe is not representative of the purchase patterns of all of our other end customers.\nWe plan to continue to strengthen and expand our network of channel partners and OEMs to increase sales to both new and existing end customers. We believe that increasing channel leverage, particularly as we expand our focus on opportunities in commercial accounts, by investing aggressively in sales enablement and co-marketing with our partners and OEMs will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of end customers. Our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by our success in leveraging and expanding our network of channel partners and OEMs.\nRevenue for our solutions, whether or not sold a subscription term-based license, is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer. For additional information on revenue recognition, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" later in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section.\nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that we are within the one-year measurement period.\nCost of support, entitlements and other services revenue\n \u2022 are used by management and the Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our performance and trends, as well as to provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business; \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nResearch and development expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher personnel-related costs, as our R&D headcount increased year-over-year by 42% in fiscal 2018 and 27% in fiscal 2019 in an effort to continue the expansion of our product development activities, including new products. This increase includes additional headcount and stock-based compensation expense related to employees who joined the Company through acquisitions.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nDisaggregation of Revenue and Billings\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nSupport, entitlements and other services revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 in conjunction with the growth of our end customer base and the related software entitlement and support subscriptions. Our total end customer count increased from approximately 7,050 as of July 31, 2017 to approximately 10,610 as of July 31, 2018 and to approximately 14,180 as of July 31, 2019.\n \nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes for certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and state income taxes in the United States. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our federal and state net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance related to our foreign net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nResearch and development\nOur total revenue was $845.9 million, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing increases of 36.6% and 7.0% in fiscal 2018 and 2019, as compared to the respective prior year periods. Our software and support revenue was $609.6 million, $898.1 million and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing increases of 47.3% and 25.9% in fiscal 2018 and 2019, as compared to the respective prior year periods. Our subscription revenue was $172.5 million, $330.6 million and $648.4 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing increases of 91.6% and 96.1% in fiscal 2018 and 2019, as compared to the respective prior year periods.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nStarting in fiscal 2019, as a result of our transition towards a subscription-based business model, more of our customers began purchasing separately sold subscription term-based licenses that could be deployed on a variety of hardware platforms. As we continue our transition to a subscription-based business model, we expect a greater portion of our products to be delivered through subscription term-based licenses or cloud-based SaaS subscriptions. Shifts in the mix of whether our solutions are sold on a subscription basis could result in fluctuations in our billings and revenue. Subscription sales consist of subscription term-based licenses and offerings with ongoing performance obligations, including software entitlement and support subscriptions and cloud-based SaaS offerings. Since revenue is recognized as performance obligations are delivered, sales with ongoing performance obligations may reflect lower revenue in a given period. In addition, other factors relating to our shift to selling more subscription term-based licenses may impact our billings and revenue. For example, our term-based licenses generally have an average term of less than four years and thus result in lower billings and revenue in a given period when compared to our historical life of device license sales, which have a duration equal to the life of the associated appliance, which we estimate to be approximately five years.\nResults of Operations\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nGeneral and administrative\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years presented. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nAs of July 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\n (1) For additional information regarding our convertible senior notes, refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessment\nThe TCJA significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included and continues to include numerous provisions that affect our business. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nProduct revenue - Product revenue consists of software and hardware revenue. A majority of our product revenue is generated from the sale of our enterprise cloud operating system. We also sell renewals of previously purchased software licenses and SaaS offerings. Revenue from our software products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is typically upon shipment for sales including a hardware appliance, upon making the software available to the customer when not sold with an appliance or as services are performed with SaaS offerings. In transactions where we deliver the hardware appliance, we consider ourselves to be the principal in the transaction and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We consider the amount allocated to hardware revenue to be equivalent to the cost of the hardware procured. Hardware revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nWe believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may adversely affect our profitability in the near term.\nSubscription billings- We calculate subscription billings by adding the change in subscription deferred revenue, net of acquisitions, between the start and end of the period to subscription revenue recognized in the same period.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\n \n \nWe had a broad and diverse base of approximately 14,180 end customers as of July 31, 2019, including approximately 810 Global 2000 enterprises. We define the number of end customers as the number of end customers for which we have received an order by the last day of the period, excluding partners to which we have sold products for their own demonstration purposes. A single organization or customer may represent multiple end customers for separate divisions, segments or subsidiaries. Since shipping our first product in fiscal 2012, our end customer base has grown rapidly. The number of end customers grew from approximately 10,610 as of July 31, 2018 to approximately 14,180 as of July 31, 2019.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nSubscription - Subscription revenue includes any performance obligation which has a defined term, and is generated from the sales of software entitlement and support subscriptions, subscription software licenses and cloud-based SaaS offerings.\n\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is July 31. Our fiscal quarters end on October 31, January 31, April 30 and July 31. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors\" or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See also \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" above.\nNUTANIX, INC.\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities was $14.8 million, $92.5 million and $42.2 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing increases of $11.0 million and $77.8 million and a decrease of $50.4 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The generation of cash during each fiscal year was due primarily to higher billings and collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including stock options and purchase rights issued to employees under our 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"2016 ESPP\"), based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton (\"Black-Scholes\") option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options and 2016 ESPP purchase rights. The fair value of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), is measured using the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock options and RSUs is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years. For stock-based awards granted to employees with a performance condition, we recognize stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period when management determines it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. The fair value of the 2016 ESPP purchase rights is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period. We account for forfeitures of all share-based awards when they occur.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nContractual Obligations\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $578.6 million for fiscal 2018 primarily consisted of $563.6 million of net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and debt issuance costs, $88.0 million of proceeds from the sale of the warrants in connection with the Notes and $72.0 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by $143.2 million of cash used to purchase bond hedges in connection with the Notes and a $1.7 million debt payment in conjunction with a business combination.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $67.1 million for fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of $69.2 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by a $1.0 million acquisition-related contingent consideration payment and a $1.0 million debt payment in conjunction with a business combination.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNUTANIX, INC.\nOther Expense, Net\nThe following table depicts the disaggregation of revenue and billings by type, consistent with how we evaluate our financial performance:\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\n \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nNUTANIX, INC.\n\nWe calculate our non-GAAP measures as follows:\nNUTANIX, INC.\nLeveraging Channel Partners and OEMs\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nSales and marketing\n\nNutanix, Inc. (\"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" or \"Nutanix\") provides a leading enterprise cloud platform that consists of software solutions that power many of the world's business applications by digitizing the traditional silos of enterprise computing. We seek to provide an enterprise cloud platform that empowers our customers to unify various clouds - private, public, distributed - into one seamless cloud, allowing enterprises to choose the right cloud for each application. Our enterprise cloud platform natively converges compute, virtualization, storage, networking, desktop and security services into one integrated, simple to consume solution, which allows enterprises to simplify the complexities of a multi-cloud environment with automation, cost governance and compliance.\nResearch and development - Research and development (\"R&D\") expense consists primarily of personnel costs, as well as other direct and allocated costs. We have devoted our product development efforts primarily to enhancing the functionality and expanding the capabilities of our solutions. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. We expect R&D expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, including our newer subscription-based products, although R&D expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nWe also intend to continue to grow our global research and development and engineering teams to enhance our solutions, including our newer subscription-based products, improve integration with new and existing ecosystem partners and broaden the range of technologies and features available through our platform.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher personnel-related costs, as our G&A headcount increased year-over-year by 29% in fiscal 2018 and 30% in fiscal 2019 in order to support our growing business.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe public cloud and more recently, hybrid cloud paradigms, have changed IT buyer expectations about the simplicity, agility, scalability, portability and pay-as-you-grow economics of IT resources, which represent a major architectural shift and business model evolution. A key focus of our sales and marketing efforts is creating market awareness about the benefits of our enterprise cloud platform, both as compared to traditional datacenter architectures as well as the public cloud, particularly as we continue to pursue large enterprises and mission critical workloads and transition toward a subscription-based business model. The broad nature of the technology shift that our enterprise cloud platform represents, the relationships our end customers have with existing IT vendors and our transition toward a subscription-based consumption model sometimes lead to unpredictable sales cycles, which we hope to compress and stabilize as market adoption increases, as we gain leverage with our channel partners, as we continue to educate the market about our subscription-based business model and as our sales and marketing efforts expand. Our business and operating results will be significantly affected by the degree to and speed with which organizations adopt our enterprise cloud platform.", "item_7_text": "Hardware - In transactions where we deliver the hardware appliance, we consider ourselves to be the principal in the transaction and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We consider the amount allocated to hardware revenue to be equivalent to the cost of the hardware procured. Hardware revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.\nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP. We determine SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the SSP is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the SSP, taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on revenue recognition.\nOur subscription term-based licenses are sold separately, or can be sold alongside configured-to-order appliances. Our subscription term-based licenses typically have a term of one to five years. Our cloud-based SaaS subscriptions have terms extending up to five years.\nWe account for our acquisitions using the acquisition method. Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities. Although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities obtained during the measurement period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of such assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.\nBusiness Combinations\nOur solutions are primarily sold through channel partners, including distributors, resellers and OEMs, and delivered directly to our end customers. Our solutions serve a broad range of workloads, including enterprise applications, databases, virtual desktop infrastructure, unified communications and big data analytics, and we support both virtualized and container-based applications. We have end customers across a broad range of industries, such as automotive, consumer goods, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing,\nAdjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin - We calculate adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenue. We define adjusted gross profit as gross profit adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Our presentation of adjusted gross profit should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $176.1 million for fiscal 2017 primarily consisted of $242.5 million of short-term investment purchases, using a significant portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), and $50.2 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $84.2 million of maturities of short-term investments and $32.6 million of sales of short-term investments.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of subscription billings, professional services billings and software and support billings to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\n (1) Excludes deferred revenue assumed in acquisitions of approximately $6.0 million, $0.1 million and $0.3 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. \nNet cash used in investing activities of $503.6 million for fiscal 2018 primarily consisted of $716.4 million of short-term investment purchases, using a significant portion of the proceeds from the Notes, $62.4 million of purchases of property and equipment and $22.2 million of net payments for business combinations, partially offset by $297.5 million of maturities of short-term investments.\nInvestment in Growth\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nGeneral and administrative - General and administrative (\"G&A\") expense consists primarily of personnel costs, which include our executive, finance, human resources and legal organizations. G&A expense also includes outside professional services, which consists primarily of legal, accounting and other consulting costs, as well as insurance and other costs associated with being a public company and allocated costs. We expect G&A expense to increase in absolute dollars, particularly due to additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs associated with our growth, although G&A expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nThe year-over-year increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes as a result of higher taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions, as we continued our global expansion, partially offset by a $5.8 million partial release of the U.S. valuation allowance related to an acquisition completed during fiscal 2019 and a tax benefit related to the change in tax law. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance related to our foreign net deferred tax assets.\nCash Flows\nNUTANIX, INC.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \nTotal billings, subscription billings, professional services billings, software and support billings, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses have limitations as analytical tools and they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Total billings, subscription billings, professional services billings, software and support billings, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses are not substitutes for total revenue, subscription revenue, professional services revenue, software and support revenue, gross profit, gross margin, cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or GAAP operating expenses, respectively. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison. We urge you to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nWe continue to invest heavily in the growth of our business, including the development of our solutions, build-out of our global sales force, projects to increase the demand for our solutions and other sales and marketing initiatives. The number of our full-time employees increased from approximately 4,010 as of July 31, 2018 to approximately 5,340 as of July 31, 2019. We have an engineering team focused on distributed systems and IT infrastructure technologies at our San Jose, California headquarters and at our research and development centers in India, North Carolina, Washington, Serbia and Germany. We have also expanded our international sales and marketing presence by continuing to build out our global teams and continuing to invest in sales and marketing initiatives, such as additional demand generation spending to increase pipeline growth. We intend to continue to invest in our global engineering team to enhance the functionality of our enterprise cloud platform, including our newer subscription-based products, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership, as well as continue to expand our global sales and marketing teams.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of business, we make commitments with our contract manufacturers and OEMs to ensure them a minimum level of financial consideration for their investment in our joint solutions. These commitments are based on revenue targets or on-hand inventory and non-cancelable purchase orders for non-standard components. We record a charge related to these items when we determine that it is probable a loss will be incurred and we are able to estimate the amount of the loss. Our historical charges have not been material.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nWe monitor the following key financial and performance metrics:\nSupport, entitlements and other services gross margin increased by 4.1 percentage points, from 54.8% in fiscal 2017 to 58.9% in fiscal 2018, and by 1.2 percentage points to 60.1% in fiscal 2019, due primarily to efficiencies gained in our support organization and personnel-related costs growing at a slower rate than support, entitlements and other services revenue, as well as the ramp up for new products, specifically cloud services.\nNUTANIX, INC.\n (1) Software and support revenue and billings include software and support, entitlements and other services revenue and billings. \nProfessional services billings- We calculate professional services billings by adding the change in professional services deferred revenue, net of acquisitions, between the start and end of the period to professional services revenue recognized in the same period.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nWe regularly monitor total billings, subscription billings, professional services billings, software and support billings, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses, which are non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures, to help us evaluate our growth and operational efficiencies, measure our performance, identify trends in our sales activity and establish our budgets. We evaluate these measures because they:\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, in a business combination, and is allocated to our single reporting unit. We review our goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. We operate under one reporting unit and for our annual goodwill impairment test, we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our enterprise value. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment analysis will be performed. We will compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount and if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of July 31, 2019:\nKey Financial and Performance Metrics\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nThe year-over-year fluctuations in cost of product revenue are in line with the corresponding fluctuations in hardware revenue. For fiscal 2018, as compared to the respective prior year period, cost of product revenue was impacted by increases in the cost of certain of our hardware components, specifically DRAM and NAND, due to supply constraints. The total cost of our DRAM and NAND components represented approximately 22% and 30% of cost of product revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. DRAM and NAND component prices increased by approximately 51% for fiscal 2018, as compared to the prior year period. For fiscal 2019, as compared to the respective prior year period, the decrease in cost of product revenue was due primarily to our continued focus on software-only transactions, which have a higher margin as compared to hardware sales.\nSales and marketing expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher personnel-related costs and sales commissions, as our sales and marketing headcount increased year-over-year by 42% in fiscal 2018 and 36% in fiscal 2019. Additionally, as part of our continued efforts to penetrate and expand in global markets and increase our pipeline growth through additional demand generation, we continue to increase our sales and marketing activities related to brand awareness, promotions, trade shows and partner programs. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase as we continue to grow.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nRefer to \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nProduct gross margin increased by 5.9 percentage points, from 63.0% in fiscal 2017 to 68.9% in fiscal 2018, and by 13.9 percentage points, to 82.8% in fiscal 2019, due primarily to the higher mix of software revenue, as we continue to focus on more software-only transactions.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nOur net losses were $379.6 million, $297.2 million and $621.2 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was $14.8 million, $92.5 million and $42.2 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Free cash flow, which is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, was an outflow of $35.4 million for fiscal 2017, an inflow of $30.2 million for fiscal 2018 and an outflow of $76.3 million for fiscal 2019. As of July 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion.\nWe believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. See the section titled \"Risk Factors\" for details. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nIn January 2018, we issued Convertible Senior Notes with a 0% interest rate for an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. There are no required principal payments prior to the maturity of the Notes. For additional information, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSupport, entitlements and other services revenue - We generate our support, entitlements and other services revenue primarily from software entitlement and support subscriptions, which include the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. The majority of our product sales are sold in conjunction with software entitlement and support subscriptions, with terms ranging from one to five years. Occasionally, we also sell professional services with our products. We recognize revenue from software entitlement and support contracts ratably over the contractual service period. The service period typically commences upon transfer of control of the corresponding products to the customer. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed.\nMarket Adoption of Our Products\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nOverview\nOur enterprise cloud platform can be deployed on a variety of qualified hardware platforms or, in the case of our cloud-based software and software as a service (\"SaaS\") offerings, via hosted service or delivered pre-installed on an appliance that is configured to order. Non-portable software is delivered or sold alongside configured-to-order appliances with a license term equal to the life of the associated appliance. Our subscription term-based licenses are sold separately, or can be sold alongside configured-to-order appliances. Configured-to-order appliances, including our Nutanix-branded NX hardware line, can be purchased from one of our channel partners, original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") or directly from Nutanix. Our enterprise cloud platform is typically purchased with one or more years of support and entitlements, which includes the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support.\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $201.4 million for fiscal 2017 primarily consisted of net IPO proceeds of $254.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and $32.3 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by the $76.6 million of repayment of senior notes in September 2016, including debt extinguishment costs, a $7.1 million debt payment in conjunction with a business combination and $1.7 million in payments for IPO costs.\nCost of product revenue - Cost of product revenue consists of costs paid to third-party contract manufacturers, hardware costs, personnel costs associated with our operations function, consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, cloud-based costs associated with our SaaS offerings, and allocated costs, consisting of certain facilities, depreciation and amortization, recruiting and information technology costs allocated based on headcount.\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of our enterprise cloud platform, which can be deployed on a variety of qualified hardware platforms or, in the case of our cloud-based SaaS offerings, via hosted service or delivered pre-installed on an appliance that is configured to order. Non-portable software is delivered or sold alongside configured-to-order appliances with a license term equal to the life of the associated appliance.\nConfigured-to-order appliances, including our Nutanix-branded NX hardware line, can be purchased from one of our channel partners, OEMs or directly from Nutanix. Our enterprise cloud platform is typically purchased with one or more years of support and entitlements, which includes the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. Our platform is primarily sold through channel partners, including distributors, resellers and OEMs.\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. For deliverables that we routinely sell separately, such as software entitlement and support subscriptions on our core offerings, we determine SSP by evaluating the standalone sales over the trailing 12 months. For those that are not sold routinely, we determine SSP based on our overall pricing trends and objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the products sold and geographic locations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 are used by management to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational and compensation plans, as well as to assess our actual performance against our goals.  Total billings, subscription billings, professional services billings and software and support billings are performance measures which management believes provide useful information to investors, as they represent the dollar value under binding purchase orders received and billed during a given period. Free cash flow is a performance measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash used in or generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. Adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and non-GAAP operating expenses are performance measures which management believes provide useful information to investors, as they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures, such as stock-based compensation expense, that may not be indicative of our ongoing core business operating results. We use these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.\nSoftware and support billings- We calculate software and support billings by adding the change in software and support deferred revenue, net of acquisitions, between the start and end of the period to software and support revenue recognized in the same period. Software and support revenue and billings include software and support, entitlements and other services revenue and billings.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNet cash used in investing activities of $16.9 million for fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of $468.1 million of short-term investment purchases, $118.5 million of purchases of property and equipment and $19.0 million of net payments for business combinations, partially offset by $588.8 million of maturities of short-term investments.\n \u2022 Upfront - Revenue from our subscription software licenses is generally recognized upfront upon transfer of control to the customer, which happens when we make the software available to the customer. These subscription software licenses represented approximately $15.9 million, $86.7 million and $272.0 million of our subscription revenue for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. For fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, the weighted average term for these subscription term-based licenses was approximately 2.9 years, 3.7 years and 3.8 years, respectively.  Non-portable software - Non-portable software revenue includes sales of our enterprise cloud platform when delivered on a configured-to-order appliance by us or one of our OEM partners. The software licenses associated with these sales are typically non-portable and have a term equal to the life of the appliance on which the software is delivered. Revenue from our non-portable software products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.\nWe plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing so that we can capitalize on our market opportunity, including growing our sales and marketing teams, continuing our focus on opportunities with major accounts and large deals, which we define as transactions over $500,000, expanding our focus on opportunities in commercial accounts, as well as other sales and marketing initiatives, such as additional demand generation spending to increase our pipeline growth. We have significantly increased our sales and marketing personnel, which grew by approximately 36% from July 31, 2018 to July 31, 2019. We estimate, based on past experience, that our average sales team members typically become fully ramped up around the start of their fourth quarter of employment with us, and as our newer employees ramp up, we expect their increased productivity to contribute to our revenue growth. As of July 31, 2019, we considered approximately 57% of our global sales team members to be fully ramped, while the remaining approximately 43% of our global sales team members are in the process of ramping up. As we continue to focus some of our new and existing sales team members on major accounts and large deals, and as we continue our transition toward a subscription-based business model, it may take longer, potentially significantly, for these sales team members to become fully productive, and there may also be an impact to the overall productivity of\nuncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nRevenue\nWe retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents, effective August 1, 2018. Our statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 has been adjusted to conform to the new standard. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on this new standard.\nFree cash flow - We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations after our capital expenditures.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nOperating Expenses\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\n (2) Includes amortization of intangible assets as follows: \nTotal billings - We calculate total billings by adding the change in deferred revenue, net of acquisitions, between the start and end of the period to total revenue recognized in the same period.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses - We define non-GAAP operating expenses as total operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, costs associated with business combinations, such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, revaluation of contingent consideration and other acquisition-related costs and costs associated with other non-recurring transactions. Our presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income and expense, which includes the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs associated with our 0% Convertible Senior Notes, due in 2023 (the \"Notes\"), interest income related to our short-term investments and foreign currency exchange gains or losses. During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, we recognized $14.7 million and $29.3 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs associated with the Notes.\nProfessional services - We also sell professional services with our products. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNUTANIX, INC.\nCost of support, entitlements and other services revenue - Cost of support, entitlements and other services revenue includes personnel and operating costs associated with our global customer support organization, as well as allocated costs. We expect our cost of support, entitlements and other services revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our support, entitlements and other services revenue increases.\n\n (2) Excludes deferred revenue assumed in acquisitions of approximately $6.0 million, $0.1 million and $0.3 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

These offerings represented approximately $156.6 million, $243.9 million and $376.4 million of our subscription revenue for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCustomer Retention and Expansion\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\n\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nProduct revenue increased year-over-year for fiscal 2018 due primarily to increased domestic and international demand for our solutions through penetration and expansion in global markets through increased sales and marketing activities. Our product revenue during fiscal 2018 was also impacted by the reduction of hardware revenue from transactions where the hardware was not sold by us.\nOur business and operating results will depend on our ability to retain and sell additional products to our existing and future base of end customers. Our ability to retain existing customers and expand our customer base will in turn depend in part on our ability to effectively maintain existing and future customer relationships, continue to innovate by adding new functionality and improving usability of our solutions in a manner that addresses our end customers' needs and requirements, and optimally price our solutions in light of marketplace conditions, competition, our costs and customer demand. Furthermore, our ongoing transition to a subscription-based business model may cause concerns among our customer base, including concerns regarding changes to pricing over time, and may also result in confusion among new and existing end customers, for example, regarding our pricing models. Such concerns and/or confusion can slow adoption and renewal rates among our current and future customer base. Therefore, as we continue our transition, we may need to enhance our efforts to educate our end customers and as a result incur higher sales and marketing costs.\nProduct revenue is generated primarily from the licensing of our solutions. Support, entitlements and other services revenue is primarily derived from the related support and maintenance contracts. Prior to fiscal 2019, we delivered most of our solutions on an appliance, thus our revenue included the revenue associated with the appliance and the included non-portable software, which lasts for the life of the associated appliance. However, starting in fiscal 2018, as a result of our business model transition toward software-only sales, more of our customers began buying appliances directly from our OEMs while separately buying licenses for our software solutions from us or one of our channel partners. In addition, starting in fiscal 2019, as a result of our transition towards a subscription-based business model, more of our customers began purchasing separately sold subscription term-based licenses that could be deployed on a variety of hardware platforms. As we continue our transition to a subscription-based business model, we expect a greater portion of our products to be delivered through subscription term-based licenses or cloud-based SaaS subscriptions.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nTotal revenue by bill-to-location was as follows:\nAssessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. Therefore, there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets impairment tests. To date, we have not recorded any impairment charges related to our goodwill and intangible assets.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nProduct revenue decreased year-over-year for fiscal 2019 due primarily to the reduction of hardware revenue from transactions where the hardware was not sold by us. In addition, our product revenue has been impacted by our continued transition to selling subscription term-based licenses, as these licenses generally have an average term of less than four years, while those with a duration equal to the life of the associated appliance have an estimated life of approximately five years. We continue to focus on more software-only transactions and therefore anticipate selling less hardware in future periods.\nAs of July 31, 2019, we had $15.8 million of accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. These accrued liabilities are not reflected in the contractual obligations disclosed in the table above, as it is uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled. Uncertain tax positions are further discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales and marketing - Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Sales and marketing expense also includes sales commissions, costs for promotional activities and other marketing costs, travel costs and costs associated with demonstration units, including depreciation and allocated costs. Commissions are deferred and recognized as we recognize the associated revenue. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our global sales and marketing organizations. Sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nThe fluctuations in other expense, net for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 were primarily related to the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs for the Notes, as the Notes were issued during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as interest earned on short-term investments. The decrease in other expense, net for fiscal 2018 was also due to $23.1 million of expense in fiscal 2017 related to changes in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\n\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nOperating Expenses\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nNUTANIX, INC.\nmedia, public sector, retail, technology and telecommunications. We also sell to service providers, who utilize our enterprise cloud platform to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers.\nThe year-over-year increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2018 was due primarily to the alternative minimum tax related to the migration of certain intangible assets and foreign taxes as a result of higher taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions, as we continued our global expansion. The increase was partially offset by a $3.9 million partial release of the U.S. valuation allowance related to acquisitions completed during fiscal 2018.\nAs of July 31, 2019, we had $396.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 million of restricted cash and $512.2 million of short-term investments, which were held for general corporate purposes. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments primarily consist of bank deposits, money market accounts and highly rated debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies and debt instruments of highly rated corporations. We do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations.\nCost of support, entitlements and other services revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher personnel-related costs relating to the expansion of our global customer support organization. The increases in personnel-related costs were due primarily to increases in our customer support, entitlements and other services headcount of 56% from July 31, 2017 to July 31, 2018 and 40% from July 31, 2018 to July 31, 2019.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of total billings, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, free cash flow and non-GAAP operating expenses to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated:\nCost of Revenue\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nIn December 2017, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), which includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses.

We are focused on actively managing these realignments. We intend to continue to grow our global sales and marketing team and continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to acquire new end customers and to increase sales to existing end customers.\nOur end customers typically deploy our technology for a specific workload initially. After a new end customer's initial order, which includes the product and associated software entitlement and support subscription and services, we focus on expanding our footprint by serving more workloads. We also generate recurring revenue from our software entitlement and support subscription renewals. We view continued purchases and upgrades as critical drivers of our success, as the sales cycles are typically shorter as compared to new end customer deployments, and selling efforts are typically less. As of July 31, 2019, approximately 65% of our end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer have made a repeat purchase, which is defined as any purchase activity, including renewals of term-based licenses or software entitlement and support subscription renewals, after the initial purchase. Additionally, end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer have total lifetime orders, including the initial order, in an amount that is more than 4.0x greater, or 4.4x greater excluding the value of hardware purchases, on average, than their initial order. This number increases to approximately 10.4x, or 11.7x excluding hardware, on average, for Global 2000 end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer as of July 31, 2019. These multiples exclude the effect of one end customer who had a very large and irregular purchase pattern that we believe is not representative of the purchase patterns of all of our other end customers.\nWe plan to continue to strengthen and expand our network of channel partners and OEMs to increase sales to both new and existing end customers. We believe that increasing channel leverage, particularly as we expand our focus on opportunities in commercial accounts, by investing aggressively in sales enablement and co-marketing with our partners and OEMs will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of end customers. Our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by our success in leveraging and expanding our network of channel partners and OEMs.\nRevenue for our solutions, whether or not sold a subscription term-based license, is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer. For additional information on revenue recognition, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" later in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section.\nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that we are within the one-year measurement period.\nCost of support, entitlements and other services revenue\n \u2022 are used by management and the Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our performance and trends, as well as to provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business; \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nResearch and development expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher personnel-related costs, as our R&D headcount increased year-over-year by 42% in fiscal 2018 and 27% in fiscal 2019 in an effort to continue the expansion of our product development activities, including new products. This increase includes additional headcount and stock-based compensation expense related to employees who joined the Company through acquisitions.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nDisaggregation of Revenue and Billings\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nSupport, entitlements and other services revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 in conjunction with the growth of our end customer base and the related software entitlement and support subscriptions. Our total end customer count increased from approximately 7,050 as of July 31, 2017 to approximately 10,610 as of July 31, 2018 and to approximately 14,180 as of July 31, 2019.\n \nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes for certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and state income taxes in the United States. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our federal and state net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance related to our foreign net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nResearch and development\nOur total revenue was $845.9 million, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing increases of 36.6% and 7.0% in fiscal 2018 and 2019, as compared to the respective prior year periods. Our software and support revenue was $609.6 million, $898.1 million and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing increases of 47.3% and 25.9% in fiscal 2018 and 2019, as compared to the respective prior year periods. Our subscription revenue was $172.5 million, $330.6 million and $648.4 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing increases of 91.6% and 96.1% in fiscal 2018 and 2019, as compared to the respective prior year periods.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nStarting in fiscal 2019, as a result of our transition towards a subscription-based business model, more of our customers began purchasing separately sold subscription term-based licenses that could be deployed on a variety of hardware platforms. As we continue our transition to a subscription-based business model, we expect a greater portion of our products to be delivered through subscription term-based licenses or cloud-based SaaS subscriptions. Shifts in the mix of whether our solutions are sold on a subscription basis could result in fluctuations in our billings and revenue. Subscription sales consist of subscription term-based licenses and offerings with ongoing performance obligations, including software entitlement and support subscriptions and cloud-based SaaS offerings. Since revenue is recognized as performance obligations are delivered, sales with ongoing performance obligations may reflect lower revenue in a given period. In addition, other factors relating to our shift to selling more subscription term-based licenses may impact our billings and revenue. For example, our term-based licenses generally have an average term of less than four years and thus result in lower billings and revenue in a given period when compared to our historical life of device license sales, which have a duration equal to the life of the associated appliance, which we estimate to be approximately five years.\nResults of Operations\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nGeneral and administrative\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years presented. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nAs of July 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\n (1) For additional information regarding our convertible senior notes, refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessment\nThe TCJA significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included and continues to include numerous provisions that affect our business. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nProduct revenue - Product revenue consists of software and hardware revenue. A majority of our product revenue is generated from the sale of our enterprise cloud operating system. We also sell renewals of previously purchased software licenses and SaaS offerings. Revenue from our software products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is typically upon shipment for sales including a hardware appliance, upon making the software available to the customer when not sold with an appliance or as services are performed with SaaS offerings. In transactions where we deliver the hardware appliance, we consider ourselves to be the principal in the transaction and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We consider the amount allocated to hardware revenue to be equivalent to the cost of the hardware procured. Hardware revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nWe believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may adversely affect our profitability in the near term.\nSubscription billings- We calculate subscription billings by adding the change in subscription deferred revenue, net of acquisitions, between the start and end of the period to subscription revenue recognized in the same period.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\n \n \nWe had a broad and diverse base of approximately 14,180 end customers as of July 31, 2019, including approximately 810 Global 2000 enterprises. We define the number of end customers as the number of end customers for which we have received an order by the last day of the period, excluding partners to which we have sold products for their own demonstration purposes. A single organization or customer may represent multiple end customers for separate divisions, segments or subsidiaries. Since shipping our first product in fiscal 2012, our end customer base has grown rapidly. The number of end customers grew from approximately 10,610 as of July 31, 2018 to approximately 14,180 as of July 31, 2019.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nSubscription - Subscription revenue includes any performance obligation which has a defined term, and is generated from the sales of software entitlement and support subscriptions, subscription software licenses and cloud-based SaaS offerings.\n\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The last day of our fiscal year is July 31. Our fiscal quarters end on October 31, January 31, April 30 and July 31. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors\" or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See also \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" above.\nNUTANIX, INC.\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities was $14.8 million, $92.5 million and $42.2 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing increases of $11.0 million and $77.8 million and a decrease of $50.4 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The generation of cash during each fiscal year was due primarily to higher billings and collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including stock options and purchase rights issued to employees under our 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"2016 ESPP\"), based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton (\"Black-Scholes\") option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options and 2016 ESPP purchase rights. The fair value of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), is measured using the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock options and RSUs is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years. For stock-based awards granted to employees with a performance condition, we recognize stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period when management determines it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. The fair value of the 2016 ESPP purchase rights is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period. We account for forfeitures of all share-based awards when they occur.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nContractual Obligations\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $578.6 million for fiscal 2018 primarily consisted of $563.6 million of net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and debt issuance costs, $88.0 million of proceeds from the sale of the warrants in connection with the Notes and $72.0 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by $143.2 million of cash used to purchase bond hedges in connection with the Notes and a $1.7 million debt payment in conjunction with a business combination.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $67.1 million for fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of $69.2 million of net proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by a $1.0 million acquisition-related contingent consideration payment and a $1.0 million debt payment in conjunction with a business combination.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNUTANIX, INC.\nOther Expense, Net\nThe following table depicts the disaggregation of revenue and billings by type, consistent with how we evaluate our financial performance:\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\n \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nNUTANIX, INC.\n\nWe calculate our non-GAAP measures as follows:\nNUTANIX, INC.\nLeveraging Channel Partners and OEMs\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nSales and marketing\n\nNutanix, Inc. (\"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" or \"Nutanix\") provides a leading enterprise cloud platform that consists of software solutions that power many of the world's business applications by digitizing the traditional silos of enterprise computing. We seek to provide an enterprise cloud platform that empowers our customers to unify various clouds - private, public, distributed - into one seamless cloud, allowing enterprises to choose the right cloud for each application. Our enterprise cloud platform natively converges compute, virtualization, storage, networking, desktop and security services into one integrated, simple to consume solution, which allows enterprises to simplify the complexities of a multi-cloud environment with automation, cost governance and compliance.\nResearch and development - Research and development (\"R&D\") expense consists primarily of personnel costs, as well as other direct and allocated costs. We have devoted our product development efforts primarily to enhancing the functionality and expanding the capabilities of our solutions. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. We expect R&D expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, including our newer subscription-based products, although R&D expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nWe also intend to continue to grow our global research and development and engineering teams to enhance our solutions, including our newer subscription-based products, improve integration with new and existing ecosystem partners and broaden the range of technologies and features available through our platform.\nNUTANIX, INC.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased year-over-year both for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher personnel-related costs, as our G&A headcount increased year-over-year by 29% in fiscal 2018 and 30% in fiscal 2019 in order to support our growing business.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe public cloud and more recently, hybrid cloud paradigms, have changed IT buyer expectations about the simplicity, agility, scalability, portability and pay-as-you-grow economics of IT resources, which represent a major architectural shift and business model evolution. A key focus of our sales and marketing efforts is creating market awareness about the benefits of our enterprise cloud platform, both as compared to traditional datacenter architectures as well as the public cloud, particularly as we continue to pursue large enterprises and mission critical workloads and transition toward a subscription-based business model. The broad nature of the technology shift that our enterprise cloud platform represents, the relationships our end customers have with existing IT vendors and our transition toward a subscription-based consumption model sometimes lead to unpredictable sales cycles, which we hope to compress and stabilize as market adoption increases, as we gain leverage with our channel partners, as we continue to educate the market about our subscription-based business model and as our sales and marketing efforts expand. Our business and operating results will be significantly affected by the degree to and speed with which organizations adopt our enterprise cloud platform.", "item_7_tables": "Table 189:
