Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.\nOVERVIEW\nWe empower healthier living through individualized connected fitness experiences and are committed to building a healthier world, one person at a time. Our principal business activities include designing, developing, sourcing and marketing high-quality cardio and strength fitness products, related accessories and a digital platform for consumer use, primarily in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. Our products are sold under some of the most-recognized brand names in the fitness industry: Bowflex\u00ae, Schwinn\u00ae, JRNY\u00ae and Nautilus\u00ae.\nWe market our products through two distinct distribution channels, Direct and Retail, which we consider to be separate business segments. Our Direct business offers products directly to consumers primarily through websites. Our Retail business offers our products through a network of independent retail companies to reach consumers in the home use markets in the U.S. and internationally. We also derive a portion of our revenue from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property.\nOur results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (\"fiscal 2022\") were driven by the actions outlined in our North Star strategy. The five strategic pillars of our North Star strategy are: (1) adopt a consumer first mindset; (2) scale a differentiated digital offering; (3) focus investments on core businesses; (4) evolve supply chain to be a strategic advantage; and (5) build organizational capabilities to win by unleashing the power of our team. We intend to leverage our many strengths to transform into a company that empowers healthier living through individualized connected fitness experiences. Our transformation will build on our leading brands, products, innovation, distribution and digital assets to create a healthier world, one person at a time.\nAt the center of health and well-being is fitness. The market size more than doubled over the past two years, is normalizing from its peak during the COVID-19 pandemic with more normal seasonality, and will settle at a new normal\u201d significantly above pre-pandemic levels based on a profound evolution in consumers' workouts and workplace habits. As a result of these changed habits and sentiments, we continue to believe much of the industry growth opportunity will remain at elevated levels relative to those experienced pre-pandemic. This results in stronger opportunities for the fitness industry and Nautilus.\nComparison for the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2022 to the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2021\n\u2022Net sales were $589.5 million for 2022, reflecting an 11.3% decrease as compared to net sales of $664.9 million for 2021.\n\u2022Net sales of our Direct segment decreased by $73.6 million, or 24.9%, in 2022, compared to 2021.\n\u2022Net sales of our Retail segment decreased by $1.8 million, or 0.5%, in 2022, compared to 2021, but increased 5% when excluding sales related to the Octane brand.\n\u2022Backlog was $32.9 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $205.1 million at March 31, 2021 as retailers are now ordering closer to inventory needs.\n\u2022Royalty income for 2022 increased by $0.01 million compared to 2021.\n\u2022Gross profit for 2022 was $148.5 million, or 25.2% of net sales, a decrease of $123.8 million, or 45.5%, as compared to gross profit of $272.3 million, or 41.0% of net sales, for 2021.\n\u2022Operating expenses for 2022 were $173.8 million, an increase of $19.6 million, or 12.7%, as compared to operating expenses of $154.2 million for 2021.\n\u2022Operating loss for 2022 was $25.3 million, a decrease of $143.4 million, or 121.4%, as compared to an operating income of $118.1 million for 2021.\n\u2022Loss from continuing operations was $22.2 million for 2022, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $88.8 million, or $2.81 per diluted share, for 2021.

Of these members, 111,000 were Subscribers.\n\u2022JRNY\u00ae Members now have access to over 1,400 on-demand instructor led videos as well as being able to enjoy over 220 locations with the immersive Explore the World feature.\n\u2022The benefits of the JRNY\u00ae platform are now even more prominently featured on the Bowflex.com and Schwinnfitness.com websites to help customers understand the full value of purchasing the company's connected-fitness cardio and strength products.\n\u2022The Company has made great strides over the last two years to expand the installed base of connectable to JRNY\u00ae\u201d products. In FY2020, the Company sold only one connectable to JRNY\u00ae product, the Max Total. Since then, the Company has launched new bikes, treadmills, and Max Trainers that are connectable to JRNY\u00ae via an embedded screen or via the user's own device. With the launch of the Bowflex\u00ae SelectTech\u00ae Workouts on the JRNY\u00ae Platform in November 2021, the Company can now include the best-selling SelectTech\u00ae 552 and 1090 dumbbells to the connectable to JRNY\u00ae installed base, which has grown to over 2.7 million units at the end of fiscal 2022 from about 0.1 million units at the end of fiscal 2020.\n\u2022In fiscal 2022, approximately 80% of total units sold were connectable to JRNY\u00ae, compared to only 22% in fiscal 2020.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nOur results of operations may vary significantly from period-to-period. Our revenues typically fluctuate due to the seasonality of our industry, customer buying patterns, product innovation, the nature and level of competition for health and fitness products, our ability to procure products to meet customer demand, the level of spending on, and effectiveness of, our media and advertising programs and our ability to attract new customers and maintain existing sales relationships. In addition, our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors, including, among other things, the overall condition of the economy and the availability of consumer credit in both the U.S. and Canada. The COVID-19 pandemic had created a heightened need for home-fitness products at an unprecedented rate and then as the pandemic lessened there was a return to a more normal seasonality. We cannot predict with certainty the longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the change to consumer habits and sentiments and therefore, the impact on our results of operations is uncertain. Our gross margins are being impacted by fluctuations in the costs or availability of materials used to manufacture our products, tariffs, expedited shipping and transportation costs. Gross margins may also be affected by fluctuations in cost associated with the acquisition or license of products and technologies, product warranty claims, fuel, foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in costs of other distribution or manufacturing-related services. Our operating profits or losses may also be affected by the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Historically, our operating expenses have been influenced by media costs to produce and distribute advertisements of our products on television, websites and other media, facility costs, operating costs of our information and communications systems, product supply chain management, customer support and new product development activities. In addition, our operating expenses have been affected from time-to-time by asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other significant unusual or infrequent expenses.\nAs a result of the above and other factors, our period-to-period operating results may not be indicative of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on our operating results and should consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties typically encountered by us and other companies, both within and outside our industry. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and, consequently, we cannot assure you any future growth or profitability. For more information, see our discussion of Risk Factors located at Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nResults from discontinued operations relate to the disposal of our former Nautilus\u00ae Commercial business, which was completed in April 2011. We reached substantial completion of asset liquidation at December 31, 2012. Although there was no revenue related to the Commercial business in 2022, 2021 and 2020, we continue to incur product liability expenses associated with product previously sold into the Commercial channel, and accrued interest associated with an uncertain tax position on discontinued international operations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (ii) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. Our critical accounting estimate is discussed below.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Term Assets Valuation\nWe evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets, including acquired trade names, customer relationships, patents and patent rights, and other long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. During the year ended December 31, 2019 (\"fiscal 2019\"), we recognized a non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $72.0 million primarily related to the goodwill and indefinite-lived Octane Fitness brand name which was sold October 14, 2020. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, we recognized no goodwill impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of either of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit.\nOur impairment evaluations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Our judgments regarding potential impairment are based on a number of factors including: the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows; market conditions; relative levels of risk; the cost of capital; terminal values; royalty rates; and the allocation of revenues, expenses and assets and liabilities to reporting units. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of our goodwill or other long-term assets and, thereby, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.\nThe fair value of acquired technology, which was determined at the acquisition date, primarily uses the cost approach. Other third party costs were also provided and considered in our analysis, where appropriate. In addition to the costs to reproduce each application, a developer's profit, an opportunity cost and an obsolescence factor were considered. The developer's profit represents the profit margin on a market participate developer's investment in the material, labor and overhead costs necessary to develop the intangible asset.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussion that follows regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\") should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in this report. Results for fiscal 2021 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 were derived from our quarterly condensed consolidated statements of operations as previously reported. All comparisons to prior year results are in reference to continuing operations only in each period, unless otherwise indicated.

twelve-months ended March 31, 2021\nNet sales were $221.7 million for 2022, compared to $295.3 million, a decline of 24.9%, versus the same period in 2021. The net sales decrease was primarily driven by lower cardio sales.\nCardio sales declined 39.6% versus the same period in 2021. Lower cardio sales were primarily driven by lower bike sales. Strength product sales grew 13.0% versus the same period in 2021. Higher strength sales were primarily driven by increased sales of SelectTech\u00ae weights and benches.\nThe Direct segment ended the year with $0.8 million of backlog as of March 31, 2022. Backlog represents unfulfilled consumer orders net of current promotional programs and sales discounts.\nGross profit margin was 30.7% for 2022 versus 53.4% for the same period in 2021. The 22.7 ppt decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by: increased product costs, logistics and discounting (-19 ppts) and increased investments in JRNY\u00ae (-4 ppts). Gross profit was $68.1 million, a decrease of 56.8% versus the same period in 2021.\nSegment contribution loss was $15.7 million for 2022, compared to segment contribution income of $86.0 million for 2021. The decline was primarily driven by lower gross profit and increased investments in media and JRNY\u00ae. Advertising expenses were $42.1 million in 2022 compared to $30.9 million for the same period in 2021.\nCombined consumer credit approvals by our primary and secondary U.S. third-party financing providers were 56.7% in 2022 compared to 52.5% in 2021. The increase in approvals reflects higher credit quality applications.\nRetail Segment\nComparison of the fiscal year-ended March 31, 2022 to the twelve-months ended March 31, 2021\nNet sales were $364.1 million for 2022, compared to $365.9 million, a decline of 0.5%, versus the same period in 2021. Excluding sales related to Octane, net sales increased 5% compared to the same period in 2021. Retail segment sales outside the United States and Canada decreased 13%, or a decrease of 9% excluding Octane.\nThe decrease in sales was primarily driven by lower demand for our bikes and higher sales discounting, partially offset by strong sales of SelectTech\u00ae weights and benches.\nCardio sales decreased 22.6% compared to the same period in 2021, driven primarily by lower bike demand. Strength sales increased 61.9% versus 2021, driven primarily by SelectTech\u00ae weights.\nGross profit margin was 21.0%, down from 30.3% for the same period in 2021. The 9.3 ppt decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by increased product costs, logistics and discounting. Gross profit was $76.6 million, a decrease of 31.0% versus the same period in 2021.\nSegment contribution income for 2022 was $44.8 million, compared to $80.7 million for 2021. The $35.9 million decrease was primarily driven by lower gross profit.\nRoyalty\nRoyalty income increased by $0.01 million, or 0.2%, to $3.7 million for 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to royalty settlements.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for 2022 were $173.8 million, an increase of $19.6 million, or 12.7%, as compared to operating expenses of $154.2 million for 2021. The increase in operating expenses primarily related to brand advertising and media spend and increased research and development and general and administrative expenses partially offset by loss on disposal group of $20.7 million in 2021.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of media advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, sales incentives related to our JRNY\u00ae platform and other programs.\nSelling and marketing information was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve-Months Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.6% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As % of net sales </td> <td>16.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to the increase in brand advertising to drive demand and preserve market share.\nMedia advertising expense is the largest component of selling and marketing and was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve-Months Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media advertising -

The decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit and increased operating expenses as discussed in more detail above.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $1.6 million and $1.1 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, was primarily related to the outstanding balance on our term loan and line of credit.\nOther, Net\nOther, net includes the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations with the U.S. and our foreign subsidiaries and equity investment impairments.\nOther, net for 2022 was $1.4 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, as compared to $5.0 million in 2021. The decrease in other, net was primarily due to an equity investment impairment for the fair value deterioration from adverse changes in the general market condition of the equity investees' industry of $2.5 million in 2021.\n(Loss) Income from Continuing Operations\nLoss from continuing operations was $28.2 million for 2022, or $(0.72) per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $112.1 million, or $2.81 per diluted share, for 2021. The decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses as discussed in more detail above.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax (benefit) expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve-Months Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,026) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29,265) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(125.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate </td> <td>21.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe income tax benefit from continuing operations for 2022 was primarily due to the net loss incurred in the U.S. The income tax expense from continuing operations for 2021 was primarily as a result of the net profit generated in the U.S.\nRefer to Note 17, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nNet (Loss) Income\nNet loss was $22.4 million for 2022, compared to net income of $88.1 million for 2021. Net loss per diluted share was $(0.72) for 2022, compared to net income per diluted share of $2.78 for 2021.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our levels of revenue, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had $14.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, compared to cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available for sale securities of $113.2 million as of March 31, 2021.\nCash used in operating activities was $66.6 million for fiscal 2022, compared to cash used in operating activities of $71.7 million for the comparable period ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to our net loss for fiscal 2022 and the changes in our operating assets and liabilities discussed below.\nTrade receivables decreased by $27.2 million to $61.5 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $88.7 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to timing of customer payments.\nInventory increased by $43.1 million to $111.2 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $68.1 million as of March 31, 2021. The increase in inventory was driven by the strategic decision to increase on-hand inventory levels for the fitness season given continued disruption in global logistics. About 14% of inventory as of March 31, 2022 was in-transit.\nPrepaids and other current assets decreased by $11.3 million to $14.5 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $25.8 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to decreases in other short-term deposits for inventory.\nTrade payables decreased by $45.7 million to $53.2 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $98.9 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to the timing of payments and slow down in inventory purchases.\nAccrued liabilities increased by $9.8 million to $29.4 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $19.6 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to deferred subscription revenue, an accrued loss contingency related to a class action lawsuit legal settlement, payroll related liabilities and customer deposits.\nCash provided by investing activities of $34.4 million in fiscal 2022 was related to the proceeds of marketable securities of $73.4 million, $13.1 million used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2022, primarily for information technology assets, our digital platform JRNY\u00ae and production tooling and equipment, offset by business acquisition costs of $26.0 million.\nCash provided by financing activities of $12.7 million in fiscal 2022 was primarily related to proceeds from long-term debt of $65.2 million and proceeds from stock purchases and stock option exercises of $1.0 million, offset by payments on our term loan and line of credit of $49.9 million, tax payments related to stock award issuances of $2.9 million and debt issuance costs of $0.6 million.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWells Fargo Bank Credit Agreement\nOn October 29, 2021, we amended our Credit Agreement dated January 31, 2020, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d) and the lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively with Wells Fargo the Lenders\u201d) (the Credit Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the Lenders agreed, among other things, to make available to us an asset-based revolving loan facility, subject to a borrowing base (the ABL Revolving Facility\u201d), and a term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d and together with the ABL Revolving Facility, the Credit Facility\u201d), in each case, as such amounts may increase or decrease in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The amendment increased the aggregate principal amount available under the ABL Revolving Facility from $55.0 million to $100.0 million (the Revolver\u201d), subject to a borrowing base. The maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to October 29, 2026. The unamortized balance on the Term Loan was $11.5 million, as of the effective date of the amendment, and will amortize on a new 60-month straight line basis to coincide with the extended maturity date. In connection with the credit amendment we recorded $0.6 million in unamortized debt issuance costs as Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The repayment of obligations under the Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets. Principal and interest amounts are required to be paid as scheduled.\nOther structural improvements to the Credit Agreement include amending the definition of Springing Trigger Event to mean the greater of (i) 10.0% of the lesser of (a) the Revolver Commitment and (b) the Borrowing Base as of such date of determination and (ii) $7.5 million. The Springing Trigger Event pertains to the period in which a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test will apply and be tested. Consistent with the Credit Agreement before the amendment, there continues to be no additional financial maintenance covenants. Additionally, the borrowing base definitions were favorably amended to change the eligible in-transit inventory sublimit from $10.0 million to $22.5 million and the total inventory sublimit from $35.0 million to $65.0 million.\nAs of March 31, 2022, outstanding borrowings totaled $29.4 million, with $10.1 million and $19.3 million under our Term Loan Facility and Revolver, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement and $65.8 million was available for borrowing under the ABL Revolving Facility.\nInterest on the Revolver will accrue at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR\u201d) plus a margin of 1.86% to 2.36% (based on average quarterly availability) and interest on the Term Loan Facility will accrue at SOFR plus 4.61%. As of March 31, 2022, our interest rate was 2.16% for the Revolver and 4.91% for the Term Loan Facility.\nThe balance sheet classification of the borrowings under the revolving loan credit facility has been determined in accordance with ASC 470, Debt. Borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit agreement that include a requirement to maintain a springing lock-box arrangement are classified based on the provisions of ASC 470 because the lock-box remittances do not automatically reduce the debt outstanding.\nShelf Registration Statement\nOn November 9, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 ( Shelf Registration\u201d) with the SEC under which we may, from time to time, sell securities in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $100,000,000. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions. We have not made any offerings of securities under the Shelf Registration.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nFor a description of our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nNon-Cancellable Contractual Obligations\nOur operating cash flows include the effect of certain non-cancellable contractual obligations. A summary of such obligations as of March 31, 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations, including interest </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>39,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum royalty obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Our purchase obligations are comprised primarily of inventory purchase commitments to our third-party manufacturers. Because substantially all of our inventory is sourced from Asia, we have long lead times and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration, or manufactured products are sourced by individual purchase orders.\nDue to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2022, we are unable to make reasonable reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, approximately $4.1 million of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, have been excluded from the contractual table above. For further information, refer to Note 17, Income Taxes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third-party claims. These may include: agreements with vendors and suppliers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services; agreements with customers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use or sale of our products; real estate and equipment leases, under which we may indemnify lessors against third-party claims relating to the use of their property; agreements with licensees or licensors, under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property; and agreements with parties to debt arrangements, under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions.\nThe nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract, and generally a maximum obligation is not stated. We hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain types of indemnifications. Because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation, and because management does not expect these obligations to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, no liabilities are recorded at March 31, 2022.\nINFLATION\nWe are subject to the effects of inflation through elevated supply chain costs, including logistics costs. Additionally, because we purchase component parts from our suppliers, we may be adversely impacted by their inability to adequately mitigate inflationary, industry, or economic pressures. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, our business could be more affected by inflation in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales if we are unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.", "item_7_truncated": "\u2022Net sales of our Retail segment decreased by $1.8 million, or 0.5%, in 2022, compared to 2021, but increased 5% when excluding sales related to the Octane brand.\nAccrued liabilities increased by $9.8 million to $29.4 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $19.6 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to deferred subscription revenue, an accrued loss contingency related to a class action lawsuit legal settlement, payroll related liabilities and customer deposits.\n\u2022Operating expenses for 2022 were $173.8 million, an increase of $19.6 million, or 12.7%, as compared to

Our principal business activities include designing, developing, sourcing and marketing high-quality cardio and strength fitness products, related accessories and a digital platform for consumer use, primarily in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. Our products are sold under some of the most-recognized brand names in the fitness industry: Bowflex\u00ae, Schwinn\u00ae, JRNY\u00ae and Nautilus\u00ae.\n\u2022In fiscal 2022, approximately 80% of total units sold were connectable to JRNY\u00ae, compared to only 22% in fiscal 2020.\nOur results of operations may vary significantly from period-to-period. Our revenues typically fluctuate due to the seasonality of our industry, customer buying patterns, product innovation, the nature and level of competition for health and fitness products, our ability to procure products to meet customer demand, the level of spending on, and effectiveness of, our media and advertising programs and our ability to attract new customers and maintain existing sales relationships. In addition, our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors, including, among other things, the overall condition of the economy and the availability of consumer credit in both the U.S. and Canada. The COVID-19 pandemic had created a heightened need for home-fitness products at an unprecedented rate and then as the pandemic lessened there was a return to a more normal seasonality. We cannot predict with certainty the longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the change to consumer habits and sentiments and therefore, the impact on our results of operations is uncertain. Our gross margins are being impacted by fluctuations in the costs or availability of materials used to manufacture our products, tariffs, expedited shipping and transportation costs. Gross margins may also be affected by fluctuations in cost associated with the acquisition or license of products and technologies, product warranty claims, fuel, foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in costs of other distribution or manufacturing-related services. Our operating profits or losses may also be affected by the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Historically, our operating expenses have been influenced by media costs to produce and distribute advertisements of our products on television, websites and other media, facility costs, operating costs of our information and communications systems, product supply chain management, customer support and new product development activities. In addition, our operating expenses have been affected from time-to-time by asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other significant unusual or infrequent expenses.\nTable 23:

2021. The 22.7 ppt decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by: increased product costs, logistics and discounting (-19 ppts) and increased investments in JRNY\u00ae (-4 ppts). Gross profit was $68.1 million, a decrease of 56.8% versus the same period in 2021.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (ii) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. Our critical accounting estimate is discussed below.\nFor a description of our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nDirect Segment\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve-Months Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.6% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As % of net sales </td> <td>8.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Arrangements\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve-Months Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,026) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29,265) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(125.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate </td> <td>21.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Gross profit for fiscal 2022 was $148.5 million, or 25.2% of net sales, a decrease of $80.3 million, or 35.1%, as compared to gross profit of $228.8 million, or 41.4% of net sales, for fiscal 2020.\n(1) Our purchase obligations are comprised primarily of inventory purchase commitments to our third-party manufacturers. Because substantially all of our inventory is sourced from Asia, we have long lead times and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration, or manufactured products are sourced by individual purchase orders.\n\u2022Operating expenses for fiscal 2022 were $173.8 million, an increase of $22.8 million, or 15.1%, as compared to operating expenses of $151.0 million for fiscal 2020.\n\u2022Net sales of our Direct segment decreased by $73.6 million, or 24.9%, in 2022, compared to 2021.\n\u2022The Company has made great strides over the last two years to expand the installed base of connectable to JRNY\u00ae\u201d products. In FY2020, the Company sold only one connectable to JRNY\u00ae product, the Max Total. Since then, the Company has launched new bikes, treadmills, and Max Trainers that are connectable to JRNY\u00ae via an embedded screen or via the user's own device. With the launch of the Bowflex\u00ae SelectTech\u00ae Workouts on the JRNY\u00ae Platform in November 2021, the Company can now include the best-selling SelectTech\u00ae 552 and 1090 dumbbells to the connectable to JRNY\u00ae installed base, which has grown to over 2.7 million units at the end of fiscal 2022 from about 0.1 million units at the end of fiscal 2020.\n\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third-party claims. These may include: agreements with vendors and suppliers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services; agreements with customers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use or sale of our products; real estate and equipment leases, under which we may indemnify lessors against third-party claims relating to the use of their property; agreements with licensees or licensors, under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property; and agreements with parties to debt arrangements, under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions.\n\u2022The benefits of the JRNY\u00ae platform are now even more prominently featured on the Bowflex.com and Schwinnfitness.com websites to help customers understand the full value of purchasing the company's connected-fitness cardio and strength products.\nRoyalty\nRoyalty income increased by $0.01 million, or 0.2%, to $3.7 million for 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to royalty settlements.\nOperating Expenses\n\u2022Net sales of our Retail segment increased by $56.0 million, or 18.2%, in fiscal 2022, compared to fiscal 2020, but increased 30% when excluding sales related to the Octane brand.\nResults from discontinued operations relate to the disposal of our former Nautilus\u00ae Commercial business, which was completed in April 2011. We reached substantial completion of asset liquidation at December 31, 2012. Although there was no revenue related to the Commercial business in 2022, 2021 and 2020, we continue to incur product liability expenses associated with product previously sold into the Commercial channel, and accrued interest associated with an uncertain tax position on discontinued international operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\u2022JRNY\u00ae Members now have access to over 1,400 on-demand instructor led videos as well as being able to enjoy over 220 locations with the immersive Explore the World feature.\nSelling and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of media advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, sales incentives related to our JRNY\u00ae platform and other programs.\nJRNY\u00ae Update\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNet loss was $22.4 million for 2022, compared to net income of $88.1 million for 2021. Net loss per diluted share was $(0.72) for 2022, compared to net income per diluted share of $2.78 for 2021.\n \nAs a result of the above and other factors, our period-to-period operating results may not be indicative of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on our operating results and should consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties typically encountered by us and other companies, both within and outside our industry. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and, consequently, we cannot assure you any future growth or profitability. For more information, see our discussion of Risk Factors located at Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\nSelling and marketing information was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.\nThe increase in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to the increase in brand advertising to drive demand and preserve market share.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Term Assets Valuation\nRetail Segment\nNet sales were $364.1 million for 2022, compared to $365.9 million, a decline of 0.5%, versus the same period in 2021. Excluding sales related to Octane, net sales increased 5% compared to the same period in 2021. Retail segment sales outside the United States and Canada decreased 13%, or a decrease of 9% excluding Octane.\nDue to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2022, we are unable to make reasonable reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, approximately $4.1 million of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, have been excluded from the contractual table above. For further information, refer to Note 17, Income Taxes.\nA comparison of the three-months ended March 31, 2021 to the three-months ended March 31, 2020 may be found in Part I, Item 2, of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-QT for the three-months ended March 31, 2021.\nInterest expense of $1.6 million and $1.1 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, was primarily related to the outstanding balance on our term loan and line of credit.\nWells Fargo Bank Credit Agreement\nComparison for the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2022 to the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2021\n\u2022Loss from continuing operations was $22.2 million for fiscal 2022, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $60.5 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, for fiscal 2020. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2020 were 21.3% and 16.8%, respectively.\n\nWe are subject to the effects of inflation through elevated supply chain costs, including logistics costs. Additionally, because we purchase component parts from our suppliers, we may be adversely impacted by their inability to adequately mitigate inflationary, industry, or economic pressures. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, our business could be more affected by inflation in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales if we are unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.\nSelling and Marketing\nComparison of the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2022 to the Twelve-Months Ended December 31, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020\")\nAt the center of health and well-being is fitness. The market size more than doubled over the past two years, is normalizing from its peak during the COVID-19 pandemic with more normal seasonality, and will settle at a new normal\u201d significantly above pre-pandemic levels based on a profound evolution in consumers' workouts and workplace habits. As a result of these changed habits and sentiments, we continue to believe much of the industry growth opportunity will remain at elevated levels relative to those experienced pre-pandemic. This results in stronger opportunities for the fitness industry and Nautilus.\nWe evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets, including acquired trade names, customer relationships, patents and patent rights, and other long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. During the year ended December 31, 2019 (\"fiscal 2019\"), we recognized a non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $72.0 million primarily related to the goodwill and indefinite-lived Octane Fitness brand name which was sold October 14, 2020. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, we recognized no goodwill impairment.\nOperating loss for 2022 was $25.3 million, a decrease of $143.4 million, as compared to an operating income of $118.1 million for 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit and increased operating expenses as discussed in more detail above.\nThe discussion that follows regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\") should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in this report. Results for fiscal 2021 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 were derived from our quarterly condensed consolidated statements of operations as previously reported. All comparisons to prior year results are in reference to continuing operations only in each period, unless otherwise indicated. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our Investors website at http://www.nautilusinc.com/investors/sec-filings/.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased personnel costs, a $4.7 million loss contingency related to a legal settlement for a class action lawsuit, and VAY acquisition costs.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nRefer to Note 17, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nNet sales were $589.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, reflecting a 6.7% increase as compared to net sales of $552.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe income tax benefit from continuing operations for 2022 was primarily due to the net loss incurred in the U.S. The income tax expense from continuing operations for 2021 was primarily as a result of the net profit generated in the U.S.\nNet sales were $221.7 million for 2022, compared to $295.3 million, a decline of 24.9%, versus the same period in 2021. The net sales decrease was primarily driven by lower cardio sales.\n\u2022Gross profit for 2022 was $148.5 million, or 25.2% of net sales, an increase of $38.1 million, or 34.5%, as compared to gross profit of $110.3 million, or 34.6% of net sales, for 2020.\nWe market our products through two distinct distribution channels, Direct and Retail, which we consider to be separate business segments. Our Direct business offers products directly to consumers primarily through websites. Our Retail business offers our products through a network of independent retail companies to reach consumers in the home use markets in the U.S. and internationally. We also derive a portion of our revenue from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property.\nOn October 29, 2021, we amended our Credit Agreement dated January 31, 2020, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d) and the lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively with Wells Fargo the Lenders\u201d) (the Credit Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the Lenders agreed, among other things, to make available to us an asset-based revolving loan facility, subject to a borrowing base (the ABL Revolving Facility\u201d), and a term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d and together with the ABL Revolving Facility, the Credit Facility\u201d), in each case, as such amounts may increase or decrease in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The amendment increased the aggregate principal amount available under the ABL Revolving Facility from $55.0 million to $100.0 million (the Revolver\u201d), subject to a borrowing base. The maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to October 29, 2026. The unamortized balance on the Term Loan was $11.5 million, as of the effective date of the amendment, and will amortize on a new 60-month straight line basis to coincide with the extended maturity date. In connection with the credit amendment we recorded $0.6 million in unamortized debt issuance costs as Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The repayment of obligations under the Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets. Principal and interest amounts are required to be paid as scheduled.\nCardio sales declined 39.6% versus the same period in 2021. Lower cardio sales were primarily driven by lower bike sales. Strength product sales grew 13.0% versus the same period in 2021. Higher strength sales were primarily driven by increased sales of SelectTech\u00ae weights and benches.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCardio sales decreased 22.6% compared to the same period in 2021, driven primarily by lower bike demand. Strength sales increased 61.9% versus 2021, driven primarily by SelectTech\u00ae weights.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nComparison of the fiscal year-ended March 31, 2022 to the twelve-months ended March 31, 2021\nComparison of the Three-Months Ended March 31, 2021 to the Three-Months ended March 31, 2020\nComparison for the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2022 to the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2020\nCash used in operating activities was $66.6 million for fiscal 2022, compared to cash used in operating activities of $71.7 million for the comparable period ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to our net loss for fiscal 2022 and the changes in our operating assets and liabilities discussed below.\nSee Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCommitments and Contingencies\nInterest on the Revolver will accrue at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR\u201d) plus a margin of 1.86% to 2.36% (based on average quarterly availability) and interest on the Term Loan Facility will accrue at SOFR plus 4.61%. As of March 31, 2022, our interest rate was 2.16% for the Revolver and 4.91% for the Term Loan Facility.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, acquisition costs and other administrative fees.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to the increase in costs as noted above.\nOn November 9, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 ( Shelf Registration\u201d) with the SEC under which we may, from time to time, sell securities in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $100,000,000. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions. We have not made any offerings of securities under the Shelf Registration.\nOur operating cash flows include the effect of certain non-cancellable contractual obligations. A summary of such obligations as of March 31, 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\nThe increase in research and development expenses in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven primarily by increased investments in JRNY\u00ae, our digital platform.\n\u2022Net sales were $589.5 million, an increase of 85.0% versus the twelve-months ended March 31, 2020. When excluding sales related to the Octane brand, net sales increased by 112%, which equates to a 46% CAGR for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in 2020.\n\u2022Nautilus, Inc. continues to enhance the JRNY\u00ae platform, creating a differentiated connected-fitness experiences for its Members, which numbered 325,000 at March 31, 2022. Of these members, 111,000 were Subscribers.\n(Loss) Income from Continuing Operations\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nWe measured our sales results versus twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 because we believe such a comparison is useful to investors as we return to a new normal level of demand post-COVID-19 pandemic.\nResults of operations information by segment and major product lines was as follows (in thousands):\n\u2022Gross profit for 2022 was $148.5 million, or 25.2% of net sales, a decrease of $123.8 million, or 45.5%, as compared to gross profit of $272.3 million, or 41.0% of net sales, for 2021.\n\nResearch and Development\n\u2022Loss from continuing operations was $22.2 million for 2022, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $88.8 million, or $2.81 per diluted share, for 2021. The effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were 21.3% and 20.7%, respectively.\nCash provided by financing activities of $12.7 million in fiscal 2022 was primarily related to proceeds from long-term debt of $65.2 million and proceeds from stock purchases and stock option exercises of $1.0 million, offset by payments on our term loan and line of credit of $49.9 million, tax payments related to stock award issuances of $2.9 million and debt issuance costs of $0.6 million.\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.\n \nAs of March 31, 2022, outstanding borrowings totaled $29.4 million, with $10.1 million and $19.3 million under our Term Loan Facility and Revolver, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement and $65.8 million was available for borrowing under the ABL Revolving Facility.\n\u2022Royalty income for 2022 increased by $0.01 million compared to 2021.\nNon-Cancellable Contractual Obligations\nOur results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (\"fiscal 2022\") were driven by the actions outlined in our North Star strategy. The five strategic pillars of our North Star strategy are: (1) adopt a consumer first mindset; (2) scale a differentiated digital offering; (3) focus investments on core businesses; (4) evolve supply chain to be a strategic advantage; and (5) build organizational capabilities to win by unleashing the power of our team. We intend to leverage our many strengths to transform into a company that empowers healthier living through individualized connected fitness experiences. Our transformation will build on our leading brands, products, innovation, distribution and digital assets to create a healthier world, one person at a time.\nMedia advertising expense is the largest component of selling and marketing and was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThe loss on disposal group for 2021 related to the disposal of our Octane business, which was sold on October 14, 2020.\n\u2022Net sales of our Direct segment decreased by $19.2 million, or 8.0%, in fiscal 2022, compared to fiscal 2020.\nOur future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our levels of revenue, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, other headcount-related expenses and information technology associated with product development.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash provided by investing activities of $34.4 million in fiscal 2022 was related to the proceeds of marketable securities of $73.4 million, $13.1 million used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2022, primarily for information technology assets, our digital platform JRNY\u00ae and production tooling and equipment, offset by business acquisition costs of $26.0 million.\n\nOperating expenses for 2022 were $173.8 million, an increase of $19.6 million, or 12.7%, as compared to operating expenses of $154.2 million for 2021. The increase in operating expenses primarily related to brand advertising and media spend and increased research and development and general and administrative expenses partially offset by loss on disposal group of $20.7 million in 2021.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\u2022Operating loss for 2022 was $25.3 million, a decrease of $143.4 million, or 121.4%, as compared to an operating income of $118.1 million for 2021.\nSegment contribution income for 2022 was $44.8 million, compared to $80.7 million for 2021. The $35.9 million decrease was primarily driven by lower gross profit.\n\nThe fair value of acquired technology, which was determined at the acquisition date, primarily uses the cost approach. Other third party costs were also provided and considered in our analysis, where appropriate. In addition to the costs to reproduce each application, a developer's profit, an opportunity cost and an obsolescence factor were considered. The developer's profit represents the profit margin on a market participate developer's investment in the material, labor and overhead costs necessary to develop the intangible asset.\nOperating (Loss) Income\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had $14.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, compared to cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available for sale securities of $113.2 million as of March 31, 2021.\nOther, net for 2022 was $1.4 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, as compared to $5.0 million in 2021. The decrease in other, net was primarily due to an equity investment impairment for the fair value deterioration from adverse changes in the general market condition of the equity investees' industry of $2.5 million in 2021.\n\u2022Net loss for fiscal 2022 was $22.4 million, compared to a net income of $59.8 million for 2020. Net loss per diluted share was $0.72 for fiscal 2022, compared to net income of $1.86 per diluted share, for fiscal 2020.\nResults of operations information was as follows (in thousands):\nThe increase in media advertising in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased media spending as we return to more historically normalized levels of advertising support to drive demand and preserve market share.\nOther, net includes the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations with the U.S. and our foreign subsidiaries and equity investment impairments.\nResearch and development expenses was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nCombined consumer credit approvals by our primary and secondary U.S. third-party financing providers were 56.7% in 2022 compared to 52.5% in 2021. The increase in approvals reflects higher credit quality applications.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of either of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit.\nThe balance sheet classification of the borrowings under the revolving loan credit facility has been determined in accordance with ASC 470, Debt. Borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit agreement that include a requirement to maintain a springing lock-box arrangement are classified based on the provisions of ASC 470 because the lock-box remittances do not automatically reduce the debt outstanding.\nTrade receivables decreased by $27.2 million to $61.5 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $88.7 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to timing of customer payments.\nOur impairment evaluations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Our judgments regarding potential impairment are based on a number of factors including: the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows; market conditions; relative levels of risk; the cost of capital; terminal values; royalty rates; and the allocation of revenues, expenses and assets and liabilities to reporting units. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of our goodwill or other long-term assets and, thereby, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nInterest Expense\n\u2022Net loss for 2022 was $22.4 million, compared to a net income of $88.1 million for 2021. Net loss per diluted share was $0.72 for 2022, compared to net income of $2.78 per diluted share, for 2021.\nResults of operations information by segment and major product lines was as follows (in thousands):\nSegment contribution loss was $15.7 million for 2022, compared to segment contribution income of $86.0 million for 2021. The decline was primarily driven by lower gross profit and increased investments in media and JRNY\u00ae. Advertising expenses were $42.1 million in 2022 compared to $30.9 million for the same period in 2021.\nOVERVIEW\nComparison of the year-ended March 31, 2022 to the twelve-months ended March 31, 2021\n\u2022Backlog was $32.9 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $205.1 million at March 31, 2021 as retailers are now ordering closer to inventory needs.\nOther structural improvements to the Credit Agreement include amending the definition of Springing Trigger Event to mean the greater of (i) 10.0% of the lesser of (a) the Revolver Commitment and (b) the Borrowing Base as of such date of determination and (ii) $7.5 million. The Springing Trigger Event pertains to the period in which a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test will apply and be tested. Consistent with the Credit Agreement before the amendment, there continues to be no additional financial maintenance covenants. Additionally, the borrowing base definitions were favorably amended to change the eligible in-transit inventory sublimit from $10.0 million to $22.5 million and the total inventory sublimit from $35.0 million to $65.0 million.\nPrepaids and other current assets decreased by $11.3 million to $14.5 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $25.8 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to decreases in other short-term deposits for inventory.\nWe measured our sales results versus the same period two years ago because we believe such a comparison is useful to investors as we return to a new normal level of demand post-COVID-19 pandemic.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nINFLATION\nShelf Registration Statement\nLoss from continuing operations was $28.2 million for 2022, or $(0.72) per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $112.1 million, or $2.81 per diluted share, for 2021. The decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses as discussed in more detail above.\nGross profit margin was 21.0%, down from 30.3% for the same period in 2021. The 9.3 ppt decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by increased product costs, logistics and discounting. Gross profit was $76.6 million, a decrease of 31.0% versus the same period in 2021.\n\u2022Net sales were $589.5 million for 2022, reflecting an 11.3% decrease as compared to net sales of $664.9 million for 2021.\n\nInventory increased by $43.1 million to $111.2 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $68.1 million as of March 31, 2021. The increase in inventory was driven by the strategic decision to increase on-hand inventory levels for the fitness season given continued disruption in global logistics. About 14% of inventory as of March 31, 2022 was in-transit.", "item_7_text": "\u2022Net sales of our Retail segment decreased by $1.8 million, or 0.5%, in 2022, compared to 2021, but increased 5% when excluding sales related to the Octane brand.\nAccrued liabilities increased by $9.8 million to $29.4 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $19.6 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to deferred subscription revenue, an accrued loss contingency related to a class action lawsuit legal settlement, payroll related liabilities and customer deposits.\n\u2022Operating expenses for 2022 were $173.8 million, an increase of $19.6 million, or 12.7%, as compared to operating expenses of $154.2 million for 2021.\nOther, Net\nThe Direct segment ended the year with $0.8 million of backlog as of March 31, 2022. Backlog represents unfulfilled consumer orders net of current promotional programs and sales discounts.\nNet (Loss) Income\nWe empower healthier living through individualized connected fitness experiences and are committed to building a healthier world, one person at a time. Our principal business activities include designing, developing, sourcing and marketing high-quality cardio and strength fitness products, related accessories and a digital platform for consumer use, primarily in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. Our products are sold under some of the most-recognized brand names in the fitness industry: Bowflex\u00ae, Schwinn\u00ae, JRNY\u00ae and Nautilus\u00ae.\n\u2022In fiscal 2022, approximately 80% of total units sold were connectable to JRNY\u00ae, compared to only 22% in fiscal 2020.\nOur results of operations may vary significantly from period-to-period. Our revenues typically fluctuate due to the seasonality of our industry, customer buying patterns, product innovation, the nature and level of competition for health and fitness products, our ability to procure products to meet customer demand, the level of spending on, and effectiveness of, our media and advertising programs and our ability to attract new customers and maintain existing sales relationships. In addition, our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors, including, among other things, the overall condition of the economy and the availability of consumer credit in both the U.S. and Canada. The COVID-19 pandemic had created a heightened need for home-fitness products at an unprecedented rate and then as the pandemic lessened there was a return to a more normal seasonality. We cannot predict with certainty the longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the change to consumer habits and sentiments and therefore, the impact on our results of operations is uncertain. Our gross margins are being impacted by fluctuations in the costs or availability of materials used to manufacture our products, tariffs, expedited shipping and transportation costs. Gross margins may also be affected by fluctuations in cost associated with the acquisition or license of products and technologies, product warranty claims, fuel, foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in costs of other distribution or manufacturing-related services. Our operating profits or losses may also be affected by the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Historically, our operating expenses have been influenced by media costs to produce and distribute advertisements of our products on television, websites and other media, facility costs, operating costs of our information and communications systems, product supply chain management, customer support and new product development activities. In addition, our operating expenses have been affected from time-to-time by asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other significant unusual or infrequent expenses.\nSales and Gross Profit\nThe decrease in sales was primarily driven by lower demand for our bikes and higher sales discounting, partially offset by strong sales of SelectTech\u00ae weights and benches.\n\u2022Royalty income for fiscal 2022 increased by $0.1 million compared to fiscal 2020.\nGeneral and administrative expenses was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTrade payables decreased by $45.7 million to $53.2 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $98.9 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to the timing of payments and slow down in inventory purchases.\nThe nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract, and generally a maximum obligation is not stated. We hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain types of indemnifications. Because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation, and because management does not expect these obligations to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, no liabilities are recorded at March 31, 2022.\n\u2022Operating loss for 2022 was $25.3 million, a decrease of $103.1 million, or 132.5%, as compared to an operating income of $77.8 million for 2020.\nLoss on Disposal Group\nGross profit margin was 30.7% for 2022 versus 53.4% for the same period in 2021. The 22.7 ppt decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by: increased product costs, logistics and discounting (-19 ppts) and increased investments in JRNY\u00ae (-4 ppts). Gross profit was $68.1 million, a decrease of 56.8% versus the same period in 2021.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (ii) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. Our critical accounting estimate is discussed below.\nFor a description of our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nDirect Segment\nFinancing Arrangements\n\u2022Gross profit for fiscal 2022 was $148.5 million, or 25.2% of net sales, a decrease of $80.3 million, or 35.1%, as compared to gross profit of $228.8 million, or 41.4% of net sales, for fiscal 2020.\n(1) Our purchase obligations are comprised primarily of inventory purchase commitments to our third-party manufacturers. Because substantially all of our inventory is sourced from Asia, we have long lead times and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration, or manufactured products are sourced by individual purchase orders.\n\u2022Operating expenses for fiscal 2022 were $173.8 million, an increase of $22.8 million, or 15.1%, as compared to operating expenses of $151.0 million for fiscal 2020.\n\u2022Net sales of our Direct segment decreased by $73.6 million, or 24.9%, in 2022, compared to 2021.\n\u2022The Company has made great strides over the last two years to expand the installed base of connectable to JRNY\u00ae\u201d products. In FY2020, the Company sold only one connectable to JRNY\u00ae product, the Max Total. Since then, the Company has launched new bikes, treadmills, and Max Trainers that are connectable to JRNY\u00ae via an embedded screen or via the user's own device. With the launch of the Bowflex\u00ae SelectTech\u00ae Workouts on the JRNY\u00ae Platform in November 2021, the Company can now include the best-selling SelectTech\u00ae 552 and 1090 dumbbells to the connectable to JRNY\u00ae installed base, which has grown to over 2.7 million units at the end of fiscal 2022 from about 0.1 million units at the end of fiscal 2020.\n\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third-party claims. These may include: agreements with vendors and suppliers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services; agreements with customers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use or sale of our products; real estate and equipment leases, under which we may indemnify lessors against third-party claims relating to the use of their property; agreements with licensees or licensors, under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property; and agreements with parties to debt arrangements, under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions.\n\u2022The benefits of the JRNY\u00ae platform are now even more prominently featured on the Bowflex.com and Schwinnfitness.com websites to help customers understand the full value of purchasing the company's connected-fitness cardio and strength products.\nRoyalty\nRoyalty income increased by $0.01 million, or 0.2%, to $3.7 million for 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to royalty settlements.\nOperating Expenses\n\u2022Net sales of our Retail segment increased by $56.0 million, or 18.2%, in fiscal 2022, compared to fiscal 2020, but increased 30% when excluding sales related to the Octane brand.\nResults from discontinued operations relate to the disposal of our former Nautilus\u00ae Commercial business, which was completed in April 2011. We reached substantial completion of asset liquidation at December 31, 2012. Although there was no revenue related to the Commercial business in 2022, 2021 and 2020, we continue to incur product liability expenses associated with product previously sold into the Commercial channel, and accrued interest associated with an uncertain tax position on discontinued international operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\u2022JRNY\u00ae Members now have access to over 1,400 on-demand instructor led videos as well as being able to enjoy over 220 locations with the immersive Explore the World feature.\nSelling and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of media advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, sales incentives related to our JRNY\u00ae platform and other programs.\nJRNY\u00ae Update\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNet loss was $22.4 million for 2022, compared to net income of $88.1 million for 2021. Net loss per diluted share was $(0.72) for 2022, compared to net income per diluted share of $2.78 for 2021.\n \nAs a result of the above and other factors, our period-to-period operating results may not be indicative of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on our operating results and should consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties typically encountered by us and other companies, both within and outside our industry. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and, consequently, we cannot assure you any future growth or profitability. For more information, see our discussion of Risk Factors located at Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\nSelling and marketing information was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.\nThe increase in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to the increase in brand advertising to drive demand and preserve market share.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Term Assets Valuation\nRetail Segment\nNet sales were $364.1 million for 2022, compared to $365.9 million, a decline of 0.5%, versus the same period in 2021. Excluding sales related to Octane, net sales increased 5% compared to the same period in 2021. Retail segment sales outside the United States and Canada decreased 13%, or a decrease of 9% excluding Octane.\nDue to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2022, we are unable to make reasonable reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, approximately $4.1 million of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, have been excluded from the contractual table above. For further information, refer to Note 17, Income Taxes.\nA comparison of the three-months ended March 31, 2021 to the three-months ended March 31, 2020 may be found in Part I, Item 2, of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-QT for the three-months ended March 31, 2021.\nInterest expense of $1.6 million and $1.1 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, was primarily related to the outstanding balance on our term loan and line of credit.\nWells Fargo Bank Credit Agreement\nComparison for the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2022 to the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2021\n\u2022Loss from continuing operations was $22.2 million for fiscal 2022, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $60.5 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, for fiscal 2020. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2020 were 21.3% and 16.8%, respectively.\n\nWe are subject to the effects of inflation through elevated supply chain costs, including logistics costs. Additionally, because we purchase component parts from our suppliers, we may be adversely impacted by their inability to adequately mitigate inflationary, industry, or economic pressures. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, our business could be more affected by inflation in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales if we are unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.\nSelling and Marketing\nComparison of the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2022 to the Twelve-Months Ended December 31, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020\")\nAt the center of health and well-being is fitness. The market size more than doubled over the past two years, is normalizing from its peak during the COVID-19 pandemic with more normal seasonality, and will settle at a new normal\u201d significantly above pre-pandemic levels based on a profound evolution in consumers' workouts and workplace habits. As a result of these changed habits and sentiments, we continue to believe much of the industry growth opportunity will remain at elevated levels relative to those experienced pre-pandemic. This results in stronger opportunities for the fitness industry and Nautilus.\nWe evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets, including acquired trade names, customer relationships, patents and patent rights, and other long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. During the year ended December 31, 2019 (\"fiscal 2019\"), we recognized a non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $72.0 million primarily related to the goodwill and indefinite-lived Octane Fitness brand name which was sold October 14, 2020. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, we recognized no goodwill impairment.\nOperating loss for 2022 was $25.3 million, a decrease of $143.4 million, as compared to an operating income of $118.1 million for 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit and increased operating expenses as discussed in more detail above.\nThe discussion that follows regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\") should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in this report. Results for fiscal 2021 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 were derived from our quarterly condensed consolidated statements of operations as previously reported. All comparisons to prior year results are in reference to continuing operations only in each period, unless otherwise indicated. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our Investors website at http://www.nautilusinc.com/investors/sec-filings/.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased personnel costs, a $4.7 million loss contingency related to a legal settlement for a class action lawsuit, and VAY acquisition costs.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nRefer to Note 17, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nNet sales were $589.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, reflecting a 6.7% increase as compared to net sales of $552.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe income tax benefit from continuing operations for 2022 was primarily due to the net loss incurred in the U.S. The income tax expense from continuing operations for 2021 was primarily as a result of the net profit generated in the U.S.\nNet sales were $221.7 million for 2022, compared to $295.3 million, a decline of 24.9%, versus the same period in 2021. The net sales decrease was primarily driven by lower cardio sales.\n\u2022Gross profit for 2022 was $148.5 million, or 25.2% of net sales, an increase of $38.1 million, or 34.5%, as compared to gross profit of $110.3 million, or 34.6% of net sales, for 2020.\nWe market our products through two distinct distribution channels, Direct and Retail, which we consider to be separate business segments.

The amendment increased the aggregate principal amount available under the ABL Revolving Facility from $55.0 million to $100.0 million (the Revolver\u201d), subject to a borrowing base. The maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to October 29, 2026. The unamortized balance on the Term Loan was $11.5 million, as of the effective date of the amendment, and will amortize on a new 60-month straight line basis to coincide with the extended maturity date. In connection with the credit amendment we recorded $0.6 million in unamortized debt issuance costs as Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The repayment of obligations under the Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets. Principal and interest amounts are required to be paid as scheduled.\nCardio sales declined 39.6% versus the same period in 2021. Lower cardio sales were primarily driven by lower bike sales. Strength product sales grew 13.0% versus the same period in 2021. Higher strength sales were primarily driven by increased sales of SelectTech\u00ae weights and benches.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCardio sales decreased 22.6% compared to the same period in 2021, driven primarily by lower bike demand. Strength sales increased 61.9% versus 2021, driven primarily by SelectTech\u00ae weights.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nComparison of the fiscal year-ended March 31, 2022 to the twelve-months ended March 31, 2021\nComparison of the Three-Months Ended March 31, 2021 to the Three-Months ended March 31, 2020\nComparison for the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2022 to the Twelve-Months Ended March 31, 2020\nCash used in operating activities was $66.6 million for fiscal 2022, compared to cash used in operating activities of $71.7 million for the comparable period ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to our net loss for fiscal 2022 and the changes in our operating assets and liabilities discussed below.\nSee Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCommitments and Contingencies\nInterest on the Revolver will accrue at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR\u201d) plus a margin of 1.86% to 2.36% (based on average quarterly availability) and interest on the Term Loan Facility will accrue at SOFR plus 4.61%. As of March 31, 2022, our interest rate was 2.16% for the Revolver and 4.91% for the Term Loan Facility.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, acquisition costs and other administrative fees.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to the increase in costs as noted above.\nOn November 9, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 ( Shelf Registration\u201d) with the SEC under which we may, from time to time, sell securities in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $100,000,000. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions. We have not made any offerings of securities under the Shelf Registration.\nOur operating cash flows include the effect of certain non-cancellable contractual obligations. A summary of such obligations as of March 31, 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\nThe increase in research and development expenses in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven primarily by increased investments in JRNY\u00ae, our digital platform.\n\u2022Net sales were $589.5 million, an increase of 85.0% versus the twelve-months ended March 31, 2020. When excluding sales related to the Octane brand, net sales increased by 112%, which equates to a 46% CAGR for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in 2020.\n\u2022Nautilus, Inc. continues to enhance the JRNY\u00ae platform, creating a differentiated connected-fitness experiences for its Members, which numbered 325,000 at March 31, 2022. Of these members, 111,000 were Subscribers.\n(Loss) Income from Continuing Operations\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nWe measured our sales results versus twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 because we believe such a comparison is useful to investors as we return to a new normal level of demand post-COVID-19 pandemic.\nResults of operations information by segment and major product lines was as follows (in thousands):\n\u2022Gross profit for 2022 was $148.5 million, or 25.2% of net sales, a decrease of $123.8 million, or 45.5%, as compared to gross profit of $272.3 million, or 41.0% of net sales, for 2021.\n\nResearch and Development\n\u2022Loss from continuing operations was $22.2 million for 2022, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $88.8 million, or $2.81 per diluted share, for 2021. The effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were 21.3% and 20.7%, respectively.\nCash provided by financing activities of $12.7 million in fiscal 2022 was primarily related to proceeds from long-term debt of $65.2 million and proceeds from stock purchases and stock option exercises of $1.0 million, offset by payments on our term loan and line of credit of $49.9 million, tax payments related to stock award issuances of $2.9 million and debt issuance costs of $0.6 million.\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.\n \nAs of March 31, 2022, outstanding borrowings totaled $29.4 million, with $10.1 million and $19.3 million under our Term Loan Facility and Revolver, respectively.

Our transformation will build on our leading brands, products, innovation, distribution and digital assets to create a healthier world, one person at a time.\nMedia advertising expense is the largest component of selling and marketing and was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThe loss on disposal group for 2021 related to the disposal of our Octane business, which was sold on October 14, 2020.\n\u2022Net sales of our Direct segment decreased by $19.2 million, or 8.0%, in fiscal 2022, compared to fiscal 2020.\nOur future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our levels of revenue, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, other headcount-related expenses and information technology associated with product development.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash provided by investing activities of $34.4 million in fiscal 2022 was related to the proceeds of marketable securities of $73.4 million, $13.1 million used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2022, primarily for information technology assets, our digital platform JRNY\u00ae and production tooling and equipment, offset by business acquisition costs of $26.0 million.\n\nOperating expenses for 2022 were $173.8 million, an increase of $19.6 million, or 12.7%, as compared to operating expenses of $154.2 million for 2021. The increase in operating expenses primarily related to brand advertising and media spend and increased research and development and general and administrative expenses partially offset by loss on disposal group of $20.7 million in 2021.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\u2022Operating loss for 2022 was $25.3 million, a decrease of $143.4 million, or 121.4%, as compared to an operating income of $118.1 million for 2021.\nSegment contribution income for 2022 was $44.8 million, compared to $80.7 million for 2021. The $35.9 million decrease was primarily driven by lower gross profit.\n\nThe fair value of acquired technology, which was determined at the acquisition date, primarily uses the cost approach. Other third party costs were also provided and considered in our analysis, where appropriate. In addition to the costs to reproduce each application, a developer's profit, an opportunity cost and an obsolescence factor were considered. The developer's profit represents the profit margin on a market participate developer's investment in the material, labor and overhead costs necessary to develop the intangible asset.\nOperating (Loss) Income\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had $14.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, compared to cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available for sale securities of $113.2 million as of March 31, 2021.\nOther, net for 2022 was $1.4 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, as compared to $5.0 million in 2021. The decrease in other, net was primarily due to an equity investment impairment for the fair value deterioration from adverse changes in the general market condition of the equity investees' industry of $2.5 million in 2021.\n\u2022Net loss for fiscal 2022 was $22.4 million, compared to a net income of $59.8 million for 2020. Net loss per diluted share was $0.72 for fiscal 2022, compared to net income of $1.86 per diluted share, for fiscal 2020.\nResults of operations information was as follows (in thousands):\nThe increase in media advertising in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased media spending as we return to more historically normalized levels of advertising support to drive demand and preserve market share.\nOther, net includes the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations with the U.S. and our foreign subsidiaries and equity investment impairments.\nResearch and development expenses was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nCombined consumer credit approvals by our primary and secondary U.S. third-party financing providers were 56.7% in 2022 compared to 52.5% in 2021. The increase in approvals reflects higher credit quality applications.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of either of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit.\nThe balance sheet classification of the borrowings under the revolving loan credit facility has been determined in accordance with ASC 470, Debt. Borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit agreement that include a requirement to maintain a springing lock-box arrangement are classified based on the provisions of ASC 470 because the lock-box remittances do not automatically reduce the debt outstanding.\nTrade receivables decreased by $27.2 million to $61.5 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $88.7 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to timing of customer payments.\nOur impairment evaluations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Our judgments regarding potential impairment are based on a number of factors including: the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows; market conditions; relative levels of risk; the cost of capital; terminal values; royalty rates; and the allocation of revenues, expenses and assets and liabilities to reporting units. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of our goodwill or other long-term assets and, thereby, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nInterest Expense\n\u2022Net loss for 2022 was $22.4 million, compared to a net income of $88.1 million for 2021. Net loss per diluted share was $0.72 for 2022, compared to net income of $2.78 per diluted share, for 2021.\nResults of operations information by segment and major product lines was as follows (in thousands):\nSegment contribution loss was $15.7 million for 2022, compared to segment contribution income of $86.0 million for 2021. The decline was primarily driven by lower gross profit and increased investments in media and JRNY\u00ae. Advertising expenses were $42.1 million in 2022 compared to $30.9 million for the same period in 2021.\nOVERVIEW\nComparison of the year-ended March 31, 2022 to the twelve-months ended March 31, 2021\n\u2022Backlog was $32.9 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $205.1 million at March 31, 2021 as retailers are now ordering closer to inventory needs.\nOther structural improvements to the Credit Agreement include amending the definition of Springing Trigger Event to mean the greater of (i) 10.0% of the lesser of (a) the Revolver Commitment and (b) the Borrowing Base as of such date of determination and (ii) $7.5 million. The Springing Trigger Event pertains to the period in which a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test will apply and be tested. Consistent with the Credit Agreement before the amendment, there continues to be no additional financial maintenance covenants. Additionally, the borrowing base definitions were favorably amended to change the eligible in-transit inventory sublimit from $10.0 million to $22.5 million and the total inventory sublimit from $35.0 million to $65.0 million.\nPrepaids and other current assets decreased by $11.3 million to $14.5 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $25.8 million as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to decreases in other short-term deposits for inventory.\nWe measured our sales results versus the same period two years ago because we believe such a comparison is useful to investors as we return to a new normal level of demand post-COVID-19 pandemic.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nINFLATION\nShelf Registration Statement\nLoss from continuing operations was $28.2 million for 2022, or $(0.72) per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $112.1 million, or $2.81 per diluted share, for 2021. The decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses as discussed in more detail above.\nGross profit margin was 21.0%, down from 30.3% for the same period in 2021. The 9.3 ppt decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by increased product costs, logistics and discounting. Gross profit was $76.6 million, a decrease of 31.0% versus the same period in 2021.\n\u2022Net sales were $589.5 million for 2022, reflecting an 11.3% decrease as compared to net sales of $664.9 million for 2021.\n\nInventory increased by $43.1 million to $111.2 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to $68.1 million as of March 31, 2021. The increase in inventory was driven by the strategic decision to increase on-hand inventory levels for the fitness season given continued disruption in global logistics. About 14% of inventory as of March 31, 2022 was in-transit.", "item_7_tables": "Table 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
