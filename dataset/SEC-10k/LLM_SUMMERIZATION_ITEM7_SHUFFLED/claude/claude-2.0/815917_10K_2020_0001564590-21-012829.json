MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and the financial condition of the Partnership. Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Partnership's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For discussions surrounding the earliest of the three years presented below, refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. All amounts are presented in millions, except as otherwise noted.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Partnership broadly categorizes its net revenues into four categories: fee revenue, trade revenue, net interest and dividends revenue (net of interest expense) and other revenue. In the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Income, fee revenue is composed of asset-based fees and account and activity fees. Asset-based fees are generally a percentage of the total value of specific assets in client accounts. These fees are impacted by client dollars invested in and divested from the accounts which generate asset-based fees and changes in market values of the assets. Account and activity fees and other revenue are impacted by the number of client accounts and the variety of services provided to those accounts, among other factors. Trade revenue is composed of commissions and principal transactions revenue. Commissions are earned from the purchase or sale of mutual fund shares and equities as well as the purchase of insurance products. Principal transactions revenue primarily results from the Partnership's distribution of and participation in principal trading activities in municipal obligations, over-the-counter corporate obligations, and certificates of deposit. Trade revenue is impacted by the number of financial advisors, trading volume (client dollars invested), mix of the products in which clients invest, size of trades, margins earned on the transactions and market volatility. Net interest and dividends revenue is impacted by the amount of cash and investments, receivables from and payables to clients, the variability of interest rates earned and paid on such balances, the number of Interests outstanding, and the balances of Partnership loans.\nCOVID-19\nIn the second half of March 2020, markets and interest rates experienced sudden declines due to the global uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic. While the federal funds rate remains near zero, markets during 2020 experienced a significant rebound compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020. However, the full extent of the pandemic and the global governmental response, vaccine distribution, and related impact on society and the economy are not yet known, and further economic or market events could negatively impact the Partnership's financial results in future periods.\nThe Partnership has several ongoing measures in response to COVID-19 to support the health and well-being of its clients, partners and associates. The ongoing measures include, among other things, closure and phased reopening of branches to public access, establishing the technological capability for branches to serve clients remotely, virtually all home office associates working remotely with limited exceptions, temporary financial support for certain financial advisors, additional paid time off and medical plan benefits for associates related to COVID-19, and a travel halt. The Partnership is continuing to assess these and other existing measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may consider additional potential measures in response to further economic or market events. Further, in response to COVID-19, the Partnership continues to review its business continuity plans and has had ongoing conversations with third-party providers to ensure the viability of their business operations supporting the Partnership. The Partnership has not experienced any significant disruptions in providing services to clients.\nIn 2020, the Partnership also implemented temporary measures to optimize firm resources and control costs in response to COVID-19 that it has since discontinued, including hiring reductions, wage freezes for certain associates, and a pause on certain strategic firm initiatives and new branch and home office real estate projects. The impact of COVID-19, as well as the Partnership's response to it, continues to evolve and is uncertain.\nPART II\nItem 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\n2020 versus 2019 Overview\nThe Partnership ended 2020 with a 3% increase in both financial advisors and net new assets to 19,225 and $66 billion, respectively, compared to 2019. Average client assets under care increased 9% in 2020 to $1,354 billion, due to increases in the market value of client assets and net new assets gathered during 2020 compared to 2019. Advisory programs' average assets under care increased 15% in 2020 to $471 billion due to the continued investment of client assets into advisory programs and higher average market levels compared to 2019.\nNet revenue increased 7% to $10,063 in 2020 compared to 2019. Results reflected an 11% increase in asset-based fee revenue, primarily due to the cumulative impact of net asset inflows into advisory programs in both 2020 and 2019, as well as average market increases. The increase in net revenue also reflected 9% growth in trade revenue due to an increase in the overall margin earned. The increase in net revenue was partially offset by the decrease in net interest and dividends revenue. Net interest and dividends revenue decreased due to the low interest rates throughout most of 2020 compared to 2019.\nOperating expenses increased 6% to $8,778 in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses primarily as a result of reductions in the following areas: discretionary spending, travel, legal, strategic firm initiatives and real estate projects. Financial advisor compensation increased largely due to an increase in revenues on which commissions are earned, an increase in the number of financial advisors, and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees. Home office and branch compensation increased primarily due to higher wages.\nOverall, the increase in net revenue, offset by the increase in operating expenses, generated income before allocations to partners of $1,285, an 18% increase from 2019.\nGiven the global health, market, employment and economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Partnership cannot reliably predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on financial markets or its financial results, including how its clients, their trading activity, the financial markets or government regulators will respond to such uncertainty. As a result, the pandemic's effects on trade revenue are uncertain, and further economic or market events could have a negative impact. In addition, the pandemic's potential effects on the economy, market volatility and the Partnership's current and prospective clients could result in a reduction in client assets under care and slower net new asset growth, which could negatively impact future asset-based fee revenue.\nBased on current information and if interest rates remain at record low levels, the Partnership expects lower net interest and dividends revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nThe Partnership continues to assess its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event the Partnership begins to experience adverse impacts in response to further economic or market events, the Partnership may consider resuming or adopting measures to reduce future operating expenses.\nPART II\nItem 7.

Growth in advisory programs fees was due to the continued investment of client assets in advisory programs and higher average market levels in 2020. The decrease in other asset-based fee revenue in 2020 reflected declines in cash solutions revenue, primarily from increased fee waivers in order to maintain a positive client yield on the Money Market Fund following the decrease in the federal funds rate to near zero in March 2020. If interest rates remain at record low levels, the Partnership expects to continue to incur fee waivers in order to maintain a positive client yield on the Money Market Fund, thereby reducing other asset-based fee revenue.\nPART II\nItem 7.

offset by a decrease in principal transactions revenue. Commissions revenue increased primarily due to higher overall margins from a change in product mix with a higher proportion of client dollars invested in equities and mutual funds, which earn higher margins than principal transaction products, although margins on mutual funds and equities have been decreasing due to changes in the mutual fund fee structures and higher volume equity trades. Principal transactions revenue decreased as a result of a decrease in client dollars invested, due to the decline in interest rates on those products during 2020 compared to the prior year. The increase in trade revenue also reflected significant increases in first quarter trade revenue as the Partnership experienced a significant increase in client dollars invested in equities due to lower securities prices as global markets became increasingly volatile in the second half of March 2020 due to the uncertainties surrounding the impacts of COVID-19.\nNet Interest and Dividends\nNet interest and dividends revenue decreased 59% to $105 in 2020 due to interest rates remaining at record low levels since the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate to near zero in March 2020. Despite increases in short-term investment balances, interest revenue decreased due to the lower federal funds rate compared to the prior year. Interest revenue also decreased due to lower interest earned on lower client margin balances. The decrease in interest revenue was partially offset by a decrease in customer credit interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019. The majority of interest expense in 2020 consisted of the minimum 7.5% annual return on the face amount of limited partnership capital paid to limited partners. The 7.5% rate is fixed and is not impacted by the low interest rate environment.\nPART II\nItem 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\n2020 vs. 2019\nThe increase in operating expenses in 2020 was primarily due to compensation and benefits expense (described below) increasing 10% to $7,186 in 2020. This increase is partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses in 2020 primarily as a result of reductions in the following areas: discretionary spending, travel, legal, strategic firm initiatives and real estate projects.\nFinancial advisor compensation and benefits expense increased 8% in 2020 due to an increase in revenues on which commissions are earned, growth in the number of financial advisors and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees.\nHome office and branch compensation and benefits expense increased 4% in 2020, primarily due to higher wages. The average number of the Partnership's home office associates slightly increased in 2020 compared to 2019, and the average number of branch office administrators (\"BOAs\") increased 1% in 2020 compared to 2019.\nVariable compensation expands and contracts in relation to the Partnership's related profitability and margin earned. A significant portion of the Partnership's profits is allocated to variable compensation and paid to associates in the form of bonuses and profit sharing. Variable compensation increased 26% to $1,414 in 2020 due to increases in the Partnership's profitability, including an increase in the number of profitable branches and an overall increase in branch profitability. Given the uncertainty of the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, the Partnership cannot reliably predict their effects on future profitability and variable compensation.\nThe Partnership uses the ratios of both the number of home office associates and the number of BOAs per 100 financial advisors, as well as operating expenses per financial advisor (excluding financial advisor compensation, variable compensation and fund sub-adviser fees), as key metrics in managing its costs. In 2020 the average number of home office associates and BOAs per 100 financial advisors decreased 5% and 4%, respectively. The operating expenses per financial advisor decreased 9%, due to a decrease in operating expenses (excluding financial advisor compensation, variable compensation and fund sub-advisor fees) and an increase in financial advisors.\nThe Partnership remains committed to financial advisor growth to continue to serve existing clients and future clients and create a positive impact in our communities. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, the Partnership implemented measures to optimize firm resources and control costs, including a temporary pause on the recruitment of non-licensed financial advisors. Despite the temporary hiring pause, the Partnership grew the number of financial advisors 3% to 19,225 in 2020 compared to 2019.\nThe Partnership plans to continue to grow its impact by focusing on hiring both experienced financial advisors and non-licensed candidates in future periods and increasing the number of clients and communities it serves. Currently, the Partnership is gradually restarting hiring to enable it to prioritize support for all financial advisors, which may result in fewer financial advisors hired than historically experienced. The Partnership is committed to an innovative and intentional strategy that offers a plan and resources for both current financial advisors and new hires. Additionally, the Partnership continues to make investments in virtual business enablement tools to help its branch teams be successful with the ongoing limitations on in-person client prospecting and consultations.\nDue to the uncertainty of the impacts of COVID-19 throughout the year, the Partnership implemented measures to support the health and well-being of its clients and associates, as well as measures to optimize firm resources and control costs. The measures included a temporary hiring reduction, decreased discretionary spending and a travel halt, which helped increase the Partnership's profitability in 2020 compared to 2019. The Partnership continues to assess the measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSegment Information\nThe Partnership has two operating and reportable segments based upon geographic location, the U.S. and Canada. Canada segment information, as reported in the following table, is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Partnership's Canada operations. The U.S. segment information is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements less the Canada segment information as presented. Pre-variable income represents income before variable compensation expense and before allocations to partners. This is consistent with how management views the segments\nPART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nto assess performance. COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has resulted in significant uncertainty; however, based on current information, the Partnership expects COVID-19 to impact the future financial results of the segments similarly.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nU.S.\n2020 vs. 2019\nNet revenue increased 7% to $9,805 in 2020, primarily due to an increase in asset-based fee revenue. Asset-based fee revenue increased 11% to $7,341 in 2020 led by an increase in advisory programs fees largely due to the cumulative impact of net asset inflows into advisory programs, as well as higher average market levels in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in net revenue also reflected growth in trade revenue of 9% to $1,667 in 2020 due to an increase in overall margin earned.\nOperating expenses (excluding variable compensation) increased 3% to $7,132 in 2020, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense for financial advisors and home office and branch associates, partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses in 2020 primarily as a result of reductions in the following areas: discretionary spending, travel, legal, strategic firm initiatives and real estate projects. Financial advisor compensation and benefits expense increased primarily due to an increase in revenues on which commissions are earned, growth in the number of financial advisors and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees. Home office and branch compensation and benefits expense increased primarily due to higher wages in 2020.\nCanada\n2020 vs. 2019\nNet revenue increased 7% to $258 in 2020, primarily due to an increase in asset-based fee revenue. Asset-based fee revenue increased 10% to $174 in 2020, led by an increase in advisory programs fees largely due to the cumulative impact of net asset inflows into advisory programs, as well as higher average market levels in 2020 compared to 2019.\nOperating expenses (excluding variable compensation) increased 3% to $232 in 2020 due to an increase in financial advisor compensation attributable to growth in the number of financial advisors and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees.\nLEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REFORM\nSee Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risk Related to the Partnership's Business - Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives, for a discussion of several proposed, potential and recently enacted Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives that the Partnership is continuing to monitor.\nMUTUAL FUNDS AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS\nThe Partnership estimates approximately 30%, 30%, and 35% of its total revenue was derived from sales and services related to mutual fund and insurance products in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In addition, the Partnership derived 13%, 14% and 14% of its total revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, from one mutual fund company. The revenue generated from this company relates to business conducted with the Partnership's U.S. segment.\nSignificant reductions in these revenues due to changes in mutual fund fee structures that result in decreased margins earned, regulatory reform or other changes to the Partnership's relationship with mutual fund or insurance companies could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nPART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Partnership requires liquidity to cover its operating expenses, net capital requirements, capital expenditures, distributions to partners and redemptions of Partnership interests, as well as to facilitate client transactions. The principal sources for meeting the Partnership's liquidity requirements include existing liquidity and capital resources of the Partnership, discussed further below, and funds generated from operations. The Partnership believes that the liquidity provided by these sources will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months. Depending on conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Partnership will, from time to time, consider the issuance of debt and additional Partnership capital, the proceeds of which could be used to meet growth needs or for other purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Partnership had $3,810 in cash, cash equivalents and highly liquid investments, consisting of securities purchased under agreements to resell, U.S. treasuries, certificates of deposit and a money market fund, $3,075 in Partnership capital and no debt. The Partnership has committed and uncommitted lines of credit in place should a liquidity need arise but has not drawn upon these lines. The Partnership believes that its financial position remains strong as it addresses the uncertainty of the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and, based on current information, does not anticipate any significant changes to its current liquidity or capital position.\nPartnership Capital\nThe Partnership's growth in capital has historically been the result of the sale of Interests to its associates and existing limited partners, the sale of subordinated limited partnership interests to its current or retiring general partners, and retention of a portion of general partner earnings.\nThe Partnership filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with the SEC on January 12, 2018, to register $450 of Interests issuable pursuant to the 2018 Plan. The Partnership issued approximately $380 million, $1 million and $3 million of Interests under the 2018 Plan in early 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. The remaining $66 million of Interests may be issued under the 2018 Plan at the discretion of the Managing Partner in the future. Proceeds from the offering under the 2018 Plan are expected to be used for working capital and general firm purposes and to ensure there is adequate general liquidity of the Partnership for future needs. The issuance of Interests reduces the Partnership's net interest income and profitability.\nThe Partnership's capital subject to mandatory redemption at December 31, 2020, net of reserve for anticipated withdrawals, was $3,075, an increase of $118 from December 31, 2019. This increase in Partnership capital subject to mandatory redemption was primarily due to the retention of a portion of general partner earnings ($130), additional capital contributions related to limited partner, subordinated limited partner and general partner interests ($1, $49 and $163, respectively) and the net decrease in Partnership loans outstanding ($19), partially offset by the redemption of limited partner, subordinated limited partner and general partner interests ($13, $37 and $194, respectively). During each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Partnership retained 13.8% of income allocated to general partners.\nUnder the terms of the Partnership Agreement, a partner's capital is required to be redeemed by the Partnership in the event of the partner's death or withdrawal from the Partnership, subject to compliance with ongoing regulatory capital requirements. In the event of a partner's death, the Partnership generally redeems the partner's capital within six months. The Partnership has restrictions in place which govern the withdrawal of capital. Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, limited partners requesting withdrawal from the Partnership are to be repaid their capital in three equal annual installments beginning no earlier than 90 days after their withdrawal notice is received by the Managing Partner. The capital of general partners requesting withdrawal from the Partnership is converted to subordinated limited partnership capital or, at the discretion of the Managing Partner, redeemed by the Partnership. Subordinated limited partners requesting withdrawal are repaid their capital in six equal annual installments beginning no earlier than 90 days after their request for withdrawal of contributed capital is received by the Managing Partner. The Partnership's Managing Partner has discretion to waive or modify these withdrawal restrictions and to accelerate the return of capital.\nPART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nThe Partnership makes loans available to those general partners and, in limited circumstances, subordinated limited partners (in each case, other than members of the Executive Committee) who require financing for some or all of their Partnership capital contributions. In limited circumstances a general partner may withdraw from the Partnership and become a subordinated limited partner while he or she still has an outstanding Partnership loan. It is anticipated that, of the future general and subordinated limited partnership capital contributions (in each case, other than for Executive Committee members) requiring financing, the majority will be financed through Partnership loans. Loans made by the Partnership to such partners are generally for a period of one year but are expected to be renewed and bear interest at the interest rate defined in the loan documents. The Partnership recognizes interest income for the interest earned related to these loans. Partners borrowing from the Partnership will be required to repay such loans by applying the earnings received from the Partnership to such loans, net of amounts retained by the Partnership, amounts distributed for income taxes and 5% of earnings distributed to the partner. The Partnership has full recourse against any partner that defaults on loan obligations to the Partnership. The Partnership does not anticipate that partner loans will have an adverse impact on the Partnership's short-term liquidity or capital resources.\nAny partner may also choose to have individual banking arrangements for their Partnership capital contributions. Any bank financing of capital contributions is in the form of unsecured bank loan agreements and is between the individual and the bank. The Partnership does not guarantee these bank loans, nor can the partner pledge his or her partnership interest as collateral for the bank loan. The Partnership performs certain administrative functions in connection with its limited partners who have elected to finance a portion of their Partnership capital contributions through individual unsecured bank loan agreements from banks with whom the Partnership has other banking relationships. For all limited partner capital contributions financed through such bank loan agreements, each agreement instructs the Partnership to apply the proceeds from the redemption of that individual's capital account to the repayment of the limited partner's bank loan prior to any funds being released to the partner. In addition, the partner is required to apply Partnership earnings, net of any distributions to pay taxes, to service the interest and principal on the bank loan. Should a partner's individual bank loan not be renewed upon maturity for any reason, the Partnership could experience increased requests for capital liquidations, which could adversely impact the Partnership's liquidity. In addition, partners who finance all or a portion of their capital contributions with bank financing may be more likely to request the withdrawal of capital to meet bank financing requirements should the partners experience a period of reduced earnings. As a partnership, any withdrawals by general partners, subordinated limited partners or limited partners would reduce the Partnership's available liquidity and capital.\nMany of the same banks that provide financing to limited partners also provide financing to the Partnership. To the extent these banks increase credit available to the partners, financing available to the Partnership may be reduced.\nThe Partnership, while not a party to any partner unsecured bank loan agreements, does facilitate making payments of allocated income to certain banks on behalf of the limited partner. The following table represents amounts related to Partnership loans as well as bank loans (for which the Partnership facilitates certain administrative functions). Partners may have arranged their own bank loans to finance their Partnership capital for which the Partnership does not facilitate certain administrative functions and therefore any such loans are not included in the table.\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPART II\nItem 7.

In addition, Edward Jones is required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least $1,344 and minimum regulatory net capital of at least 6% of aggregate debit items as calculated under the alternative method. The Partnership has the ability to draw on various types of loans. The associated interest rate depends on the type of loan, duration of the loan, whether the loan is secured or unsecured and the amount of leverage. Contractual rates are based on an index rate plus the applicable rate. The 2018 Credit Facility is intended to provide short-term liquidity to the Partnership should the need arise. As of December 31, 2020, the Partnership was in compliance with all covenants related to the 2018 Credit Facility.\nIn addition, the Partnership has multiple uncommitted secured lines of credit totaling $390 that are subject to change at the discretion of the banks. The Partnership also has an additional uncommitted line of credit where the amount and the associated collateral requirements are at the bank's discretion in the event of a borrowing. Based on credit market conditions and the uncommitted nature of these credit facilities, it is possible that these lines of credit could decrease or not be available in the future. Actual borrowing capacity on secured lines is based on availability of client margin securities or firm-owned securities, which would serve as collateral on loans in the event the Partnership borrowed against these lines.\nPART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nThere were no amounts outstanding on the 2018 Credit Facility or the uncommitted lines of credit as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. In addition, the Partnership did not have any draws against these lines of credit during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, except for periodically testing draw procedures.\nCash Activity\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Partnership had $1,125 in cash and cash equivalents and $1,714 in securities purchased under agreements to resell, which generally have maturities of less than one week. This totaled $2,839 of Partnership liquidity as of December 31, 2020, a 5% ($132) increase from $2,707 at December 31, 2019. The Partnership had $17,918 and $10,387 in cash and investments segregated under federal regulations as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was not available for general use. As of December 31, 2020, the Partnership held $971 in U.S. treasuries to help facilitate cash management and maintain firm liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, $12,051 of the cash and investments segregated under federal regulations balance consisted of U.S. treasuries, compared with $3,394 as of December 31, 2019. Given global health, market, employment and economic uncertainty from COVID-19, the Partnership increased the proportion of U.S. treasuries to focus on principal protection of the portfolio. The increase in cash and investments segregated under federal regulations was primarily due to an increase in cash held in clients' accounts, resulting in a corresponding increase in payables to clients. Changes in cash were also due to timing of daily client cash activity in relation to the weekly segregation requirement.\nThe Partnership continues to evaluate its cash management strategy. Banks have experienced a significant increase in cash deposits due to the market and economic uncertainty from COVID-19, which may impact the Partnership's ability to continue to find financial institutions at which to place funds for principal protection while earning a reasonable rate of return on those funds.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn 2020, the Partnership implemented a temporary pause on certain strategic firm initiatives to help control costs in response to COVID-19, which reduced the actual capital expenditures to $129 from the 2020 estimate of $175. The Partnership estimates 2021 capital spending of approximately $225 as the pause on certain strategic firm initiatives has been lifted, and the Partnership expects to invest in software and other technology upgrades, real estate and construction and facilities improvements at various branch offices.\nRegulatory Requirements\nAs a result of its activities as a U.S. broker-dealer, Edward Jones is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule and capital compliance rules of the FINRA Rule 4110. Under the alternative method permitted by the rules, Edward Jones must maintain minimum net capital, as defined, equal to the greater of $0.25 or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. The net capital rules also provide that Edward Jones' partnership capital may not be withdrawn if the resulting net capital would be less than minimum requirements. Additionally, certain withdrawals of partnership capital require the approval of the SEC and FINRA to the extent they exceed defined levels, even though such withdrawals would not cause net capital to be less than minimum requirements.\nThe Partnership's Canada broker-dealer subsidiary is a registered broker-dealer regulated by IIROC. Under the regulations prescribed by IIROC, the Partnership's Canada broker-dealer subsidiary is required to maintain minimum levels of risk-adjusted capital, which are dependent on the nature of the Partnership's Canada broker-dealer subsidiary's assets and operations.\nPART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nThe following table shows the Partnership's capital figures for its U.S. and Canada broker-dealer subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S.:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net capital in excess of the minimum required\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net capital as a percentage of aggregate debit\nitems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net capital after anticipated capital withdrawals, as\na percentage of aggregate debit items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canada:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory risk-adjusted capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory risk-adjusted capital in excess of the\nminimum required to be held by IIROC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. net capital, Canada regulatory risk-adjusted capital and the related capital percentages may fluctuate on a daily basis.

Subsequent to December 31, 2020, these commitments may fluctuate based on changing business needs and conditions.

Additionally, the Partnership would incur termination fees of approximately $103 at December 31, 2020 in the event the Partnership terminated existing contractual commitments with certain vendors providing ongoing services primarily for information technology, operations and marketing. These termination fees will decrease over the related contract periods, which generally expire within the next three years.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Partnership's financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which may require judgment and involve estimation processes to determine its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses which affect its results of operations.\nThe Partnership believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following critical policy requires estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nAccruals for Contingencies. The Partnership accrues when appropriate for potential losses that may arise out of various legal and regulatory matters, including arbitrations, class actions, other litigation, and examinations, investigations and proceedings by governmental authorities, SROs and other regulators, to the extent that the amount of such potential losses can be estimated, in accordance with FASB ASC No. 450, Contingencies. See Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 for further discussion of these items. The Partnership regularly monitors its exposures to potential losses. The Partnership's aggregate accrued liability with respect to litigation and regulatory\nPART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nproceedings represents its estimate of probable losses, as determined under FASB ASC No. 450, Contingencies, after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the Partnership's experience with other legal and regulatory matters and discussions with legal counsel.\nIncluded in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements are additional discussions of the Partnership's accounting policies.\nTHE EFFECTS OF INFLATION\nThe Partnership's net assets are primarily monetary, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, cash and investments segregated under federal regulations, firm-owned securities, and receivables, less liabilities. Monetary net assets are primarily liquid in nature and would not be significantly affected by inflation. Inflation and future expectations of inflation influence securities prices, as well as activity levels in the securities markets.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nRegulatory Requirements\nThe discussion below details the significant fluctuations and their drivers for each of the major categories of the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Income.\n (1) Client dollars invested for trade revenue represents the principal amount of clients' buy and sell transactions resulting in revenue and for advisory programs revenue represents the net of the inflows and outflows of client dollars into advisory programs. \nCash Activity\nThe Partnership uses the ratios of both the number of home office associates and the number of BOAs per 100 financial advisors, as well as operating expenses per financial advisor (excluding financial advisor compensation, variable compensation and fund sub-adviser fees), as key metrics in managing its costs. In 2020 the average number of home office associates and BOAs per 100 financial advisors decreased 5% and 4%, respectively. The operating expenses per financial advisor decreased 9%, due to a decrease in operating expenses (excluding financial advisor compensation, variable compensation and fund sub-advisor fees) and an increase in financial advisors.\nThe Partnership estimates approximately 30%, 30%, and 35% of its total revenue was derived from sales and services related to mutual fund and insurance products in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In addition, the Partnership derived 13%, 14% and 14% of its total revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, from one mutual fund company. The revenue generated from this company relates to business conducted with the Partnership's U.S. segment.\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended December 31,\n</td>

well-being of its clients and associates, as well as measures to optimize firm resources and control costs. The measures included a temporary hiring reduction, decreased discretionary spending and a travel halt, which helped increase the Partnership's profitability in 2020 compared to 2019. The Partnership continues to assess the measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBased on current information and if interest rates remain at record low levels, the Partnership expects lower net interest and dividends revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nThe Partnership continues to evaluate its cash management strategy. Banks have experienced a significant increase in cash deposits due to the market and economic uncertainty from COVID-19, which may impact the Partnership's ability to continue to find financial institutions at which to place funds for principal protection while earning a reasonable rate of return on those funds.\nThe Partnership has several ongoing measures in response to COVID-19 to support the health and well-being of its clients, partners and associates. The ongoing measures include, among other things, closure and phased reopening of branches to public access, establishing the technological capability for branches to serve clients remotely, virtually all home office associates working remotely with limited exceptions, temporary financial support for certain financial advisors, additional paid time off and medical plan benefits for associates related to COVID-19, and a travel halt. The Partnership is continuing to assess these and other existing measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may consider additional potential measures in response to further economic or market events. Further, in response to COVID-19, the Partnership continues to review its business continuity plans and has had ongoing conversations with third-party providers to ensure the viability of their business operations supporting the Partnership. The Partnership has not experienced any significant disruptions in providing services to clients.\nRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nU.S. net capital, Canada regulatory risk-adjusted capital and the related capital percentages may fluctuate on a daily basis. In addition, Trust Co. was in compliance with its regulatory capital requirements.\nPART II\nThe increase in operating expenses in 2020 was primarily due to compensation and benefits expense (described below) increasing 10% to $7,186 in 2020. This increase is partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses in 2020 primarily as a result of reductions in the following areas: discretionary spending, travel, legal, strategic firm initiatives and real estate projects.\nFinancial advisor compensation and benefits expense increased 8% in 2020 due to an increase in revenues on which commissions are earned, growth in the number of financial advisors and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees.\n\nCOVID-19\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nThe following table shows financial information for the Partnership's reportable segments.\n2020 versus 2019 Overview\nThe Partnership's financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which may require judgment and involve estimation processes to determine its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses which affect its results of operations.\nThe Partnership broadly categorizes its net revenues into four categories: fee revenue, trade revenue, net interest and dividends revenue (net of interest expense) and other revenue. In the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Income, fee revenue is composed of asset-based fees and account and activity fees. Asset-based fees are generally a percentage of the total value of specific assets in client accounts. These fees are impacted by client dollars invested in and divested from the accounts which generate asset-based fees and changes in market values of the assets. Account and activity fees and other revenue are impacted by the number of client accounts and the variety of services provided to those accounts, among other factors. Trade revenue is composed of commissions and principal transactions revenue. Commissions are earned from the purchase or sale of mutual fund shares and equities as well as the purchase of insurance products. Principal transactions revenue primarily results from the Partnership's distribution of and participation in principal trading activities in municipal obligations, over-the-counter corporate obligations, and certificates of deposit. Trade revenue is impacted by the number of financial advisors, trading volume (client dollars invested), mix of the products in which clients invest, size of trades, margins earned on the transactions and market volatility. Net interest and dividends revenue is impacted by the amount of cash and investments, receivables from and payables to clients, the variability of interest rates earned and paid on such balances, the number of Interests outstanding, and the balances of Partnership loans.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Partnership's $500 committed revolving line of credit (the \"2018 Credit Facility\") entered into in September 2018, the Partnership is required to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 35% and minimum Partnership capital, net of reserve for anticipated withdrawals and Partnership loans, of at least $1,884. In addition, Edward Jones is required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least $1,344 and minimum regulatory net capital of at least 6% of aggregate debit items as calculated under the alternative method. The Partnership has the ability to draw on various types of loans. The associated interest rate depends on the type of loan, duration of the loan, whether the loan is secured or unsecured and the amount of leverage. Contractual rates are based on an index rate plus the applicable rate. The 2018 Credit Facility is intended to provide short-term liquidity to the Partnership should the need arise. As of December 31, 2020, the Partnership was in compliance with all covenants related to the 2018 Credit Facility.\n (3) 2018 assets under care were reclassified to conform to current year presentation. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAdditionally, as disclosed in the Partnership's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 10, 2020, Penny Pennington, Managing Partner, announced the appointment of general partner Lisa Dolan, age 54, to the Partnership's Executive Committee. It was also announced that Ms. Dolan has been named Chief Operating Officer for Edward Jones with responsibility for leading Operations, Service, Firm Analytics, Strategic Enablement and Planning and Workplace Services. Ms. Dolan joined the Edward Jones Finance division in 2005 with responsibility for tax and partnership accounting. She was named a principal in 2007 after which her responsibilities have expanded to include financial and regulatory reporting, expenditure management, compensation accounting and finance systems. Ms. Dolan was appointed to the Partnership's Audit Committee in 2014. In 2016, she assumed responsibility for the Finance division.\n2020 vs. 2019\nHome office and branch compensation and benefits expense increased 4% in 2020, primarily due to higher wages. The average number of the Partnership's home office associates slightly increased in 2020 compared to 2019, and the average number of branch office administrators (\"BOAs\") increased 1% in 2020 compared to 2019.\nThe Partnership's capital subject to mandatory redemption at December 31, 2020, net of reserve for anticipated withdrawals, was $3,075, an increase of $118 from December 31, 2019. This increase in Partnership capital subject to mandatory redemption was primarily due to the retention of a portion of general partner earnings ($130), additional capital contributions related to limited partner, subordinated limited partner and general partner interests ($1, $49 and $163, respectively) and the net decrease in Partnership loans outstanding ($19), partially offset by the redemption of limited partner, subordinated limited partner and general partner interests ($13, $37 and $194, respectively). During each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Partnership retained 13.8% of income allocated to general partners.\nOVERVIEW\nThe following table sets forth the change in major categories of the Consolidated Statements of Income as well as several key related metrics for the last three years. Management of the Partnership relies on this financial information and the related metrics to evaluate the Partnership's operating performance and financial condition.\n\nOperating expenses (excluding variable compensation) increased 3% to $232 in 2020 due to an increase in financial advisor compensation attributable to growth in the number of financial advisors and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees.\nAccruals for Contingencies. The Partnership accrues when appropriate for potential losses that may arise out of various legal and regulatory matters, including arbitrations, class actions, other litigation, and examinations, investigations and proceedings by governmental authorities, SROs and other regulators, to the extent that the amount of such potential losses can be estimated, in accordance with FASB ASC No. 450, Contingencies. See Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 for further discussion of these items. The Partnership regularly monitors its exposures to potential losses. The Partnership's aggregate accrued liability with respect to litigation and regulatory\nSegment Information\nThe Partnership requires liquidity to cover its operating expenses, net capital requirements, capital expenditures, distributions to partners and redemptions of Partnership interests, as well as to facilitate client transactions. The principal sources for meeting the Partnership's liquidity requirements include existing liquidity and capital resources of the Partnership, discussed further below, and funds generated from operations. The Partnership believes that the liquidity provided by these sources will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months. Depending on conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Partnership will, from time to time, consider the issuance of debt and additional Partnership capital, the proceeds of which could be used to meet growth needs or for other purposes.\nOperating Expenses\nThe Partnership's net assets are primarily monetary, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, cash and investments segregated under federal regulations, firm-owned securities, and receivables, less liabilities. Monetary net assets are primarily liquid in nature and would not be significantly affected by inflation. Inflation and future expectations of inflation influence securities prices, as well as activity levels in the securities markets. As a result, profitability and capital may be impacted by inflation and inflationary expectations. Additionally, inflation's impact on the Partnership's operating expenses may affect profitability to the extent that additional costs are not recoverable through increased prices of services offered by the Partnership.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nPART II\nThe Partnership filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with the SEC on January 12, 2018, to register $450 of Interests issuable pursuant to the 2018 Plan. The Partnership issued approximately $380 million, $1 million and $3 million of Interests under the 2018 Plan in early 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. The remaining $66 million of Interests may be issued under the 2018 Plan at the discretion of the Managing Partner in the future. Proceeds from the offering under the 2018 Plan are expected to be used for working capital and general firm purposes and to ensure there is adequate general liquidity of the Partnership for future needs. The issuance of Interests reduces the Partnership's net interest income and profitability.\nLEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REFORM\nEXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CHANGES\nU.S.\nThe Partnership continues to assess its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event the Partnership begins to experience adverse impacts in response to further economic or market events, the Partnership may consider resuming or adopting measures to reduce future operating expenses.\nAs a result of its activities as a U.S. broker-dealer, Edward Jones is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule and capital compliance rules of the FINRA Rule 4110. Under the alternative method permitted by the rules, Edward Jones must maintain minimum net capital, as defined, equal to the greater of $0.25 or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. The net capital rules also provide that Edward Jones' partnership capital may not be withdrawn if the resulting net capital would be less than minimum requirements. Additionally, certain withdrawals of partnership capital require the approval of the SEC and FINRA to the extent they exceed defined levels, even though such withdrawals would not cause net capital to be less than minimum requirements.\nPART II\nSee Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statement and Supplementary Data - Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and the financial condition of the Partnership. Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Partnership's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For discussions surrounding the earliest of the three years presented below, refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. All amounts are presented in millions, except as otherwise noted.\nPartnership Capital\nNet revenue increased 7% to $9,805 in 2020, primarily due to an increase in asset-based fee revenue. Asset-based fee revenue increased 11% to $7,341 in 2020 led by an increase in advisory programs fees largely due to the cumulative impact of net asset inflows into advisory programs, as well as higher average market levels in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in net revenue also reflected growth in trade revenue of 9% to $1,667 in 2020 due to an increase in overall margin earned.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nGiven the global health, market, employment and economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Partnership cannot reliably predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on financial markets or its financial results, including how its clients, their trading activity, the financial markets or government regulators will respond to such uncertainty. As a result, the pandemic's effects on trade revenue are uncertain, and further economic or market events could have a negative impact. In addition, the pandemic's potential effects on the economy, market volatility and the Partnership's current and prospective clients could result in a reduction in client assets under care and slower net new asset growth, which could negatively impact future asset-based fee revenue.\nLines of Credit\nHistorically, neither the amount of Partnership capital financed with individual loans as indicated in the table above, nor the amount of partner withdrawal requests, has had a significant impact on the Partnership's liquidity or capital resources.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nAny partner may also choose to have individual banking arrangements for their Partnership capital contributions. Any bank financing of capital contributions is in the form of unsecured bank loan agreements and is between the individual and the bank. The Partnership does not guarantee these bank loans, nor can the partner pledge his or her partnership interest as collateral for the bank loan. The Partnership performs certain administrative functions in connection with its limited partners who have elected to finance a portion of their Partnership capital contributions through individual unsecured bank loan agreements from banks with whom the Partnership has other banking relationships. For all limited partner capital contributions financed through such bank loan agreements, each agreement instructs the Partnership to apply the proceeds from the redemption of that individual's capital account to the repayment of the limited partner's bank loan prior to any funds being released to the partner. In addition, the partner is required to apply Partnership earnings, net of any distributions to pay taxes, to service the interest and principal on the bank loan. Should a partner's individual bank loan not be renewed upon maturity for any reason, the Partnership could experience increased requests for capital liquidations, which could adversely impact the Partnership's liquidity. In addition, partners who finance all or a portion of their capital contributions with bank financing may be more likely to request the withdrawal of capital to meet bank financing requirements should the partners experience a period of reduced earnings. As a partnership, any withdrawals by general partners, subordinated limited partners or limited partners would reduce the Partnership's available liquidity and capital.\nTHE EFFECTS OF INFLATION\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\n (1) Total Partnership capital, as defined for this table, is before the reduction of Partnership loans and is net of reserve for anticipated withdrawals. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe following table shows the Partnership's capital figures for its U.S. and Canada broker-dealer subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nFee Revenue\nAs disclosed in the Partnership's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 4, 2020, Vincent J. Ferrari, general partner of the Partnership, member of the Partnership's Executive and Management Committees, Chairman of the Partnership's Audit Committee and the Partnership's Chief Administrative Officer, has retired after 17 years of service to Edward Jones and the Partnership effective December 31, 2020. Mr. Ferrari joined Edward Jones in 2003 as a senior director in Information Systems. He was named a principal in 2004 and Chief Information Officer in 2007.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nThe following table shows the composition of the Partnership's aggregate bank lines of credit in place as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018\nThere were no amounts outstanding on the 2018 Credit Facility or the uncommitted lines of credit as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. In addition, the Partnership did not have any draws against these lines of credit during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, except for periodically testing draw procedures.\n (4) Attrition % represents the number of financial advisors that left the firm during the year compared to the total number of financial advisors as of year end. \n (2) Operating expenses used in calculation represent total operating expenses less financial advisor compensation, variable compensation and fund sub-adviser fees. \nIn addition, the Partnership has multiple uncommitted secured lines of credit totaling $390 that are subject to change at the discretion of the banks. The Partnership also has an additional uncommitted line of credit where the amount and the associated collateral requirements are at the bank's discretion in the event of a borrowing. Based on credit market conditions and the uncommitted nature of these credit facilities, it is possible that these lines of credit could decrease or not be available in the future. Actual borrowing capacity on secured lines is based on availability of client margin securities or firm-owned securities, which would serve as collateral on loans in the event the Partnership borrowed against these lines.\nto assess performance. COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has resulted in significant uncertainty; however, based on current information, the Partnership expects COVID-19 to impact the future financial results of the segments similarly. The following table shows financial information for the Partnership's reportable segments.\n\nThe Partnership has two operating and reportable segments based upon geographic location, the U.S. and Canada. Canada segment information, as reported in the following table, is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Partnership's Canada operations. The U.S. segment information is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements less the Canada segment information as presented. Pre-variable income represents income before variable compensation expense and before allocations to partners. This is consistent with how management views the segments\nFee revenue, which consists of asset-based fees and account and activity fees, increased 10% in 2020 to $8,175. A discussion of fee revenue components follows.\nPART II\nIn the second half of March 2020, markets and interest rates experienced sudden declines due to the global uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic. While the federal funds rate remains near zero, markets during 2020 experienced a significant rebound compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020. However, the full extent of the pandemic and the global governmental response, vaccine distribution, and related impact on society and the economy are not yet known, and further economic or market events could negatively impact the Partnership's financial results in future periods.\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nPART II\nCapital Expenditures\nOverall asset-based fee revenue increased 11% to $7,515 in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a 15% increase in revenue from advisory programs fees. Growth in advisory programs fees was due to the continued investment of client assets in advisory programs and higher average market levels in 2020. The decrease in other asset-based fee revenue in 2020 reflected declines in cash solutions revenue, primarily from increased fee waivers in order to maintain a positive client yield on the Money Market Fund following the decrease in the federal funds rate to near zero in March 2020. If interest rates remain at record low levels, the Partnership expects to continue to incur fee waivers in order to maintain a positive client yield on the Money Market Fund, thereby reducing other asset-based fee revenue.\nSignificant reductions in these revenues due to changes in mutual fund fee structures that result in decreased margins earned, regulatory reform or other changes to the Partnership's relationship with mutual fund or insurance companies could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nUnder the terms of the Partnership Agreement, a partner's capital is required to be redeemed by the Partnership in the event of the partner's death or withdrawal from the Partnership, subject to compliance with ongoing regulatory capital requirements. In the event of a partner's death, the Partnership generally redeems the partner's capital within six months. The Partnership has restrictions in place which govern the withdrawal of capital. Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, limited partners requesting withdrawal from the Partnership are to be repaid their capital in three equal annual installments beginning no earlier than 90 days after their withdrawal notice is received by the Managing Partner. The capital of general partners requesting withdrawal from the Partnership is converted to subordinated limited partnership capital or, at the discretion of the Managing Partner, redeemed by the Partnership. Subordinated limited partners requesting withdrawal are repaid their capital in six equal annual installments beginning no earlier than 90 days after their request for withdrawal of contributed capital is received by the Managing Partner. The Partnership's Managing Partner has discretion to waive or modify these withdrawal restrictions and to accelerate the return of capital.\nOperating expenses increased 6% in 2020 to $8,778, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense. A discussion of operating expense components follows.\nMUTUAL FUNDS AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS\nPART II\n\nThe Partnership, while not a party to any partner unsecured bank loan agreements, does facilitate making payments of allocated income to certain banks on behalf of the limited partner. The following table represents amounts related to Partnership loans as well as bank loans (for which the Partnership facilitates certain administrative functions). Partners may have arranged their own bank loans to finance their Partnership capital for which the Partnership does not facilitate certain administrative functions and therefore any such loans are not included in the table.\nOperating expenses (excluding variable compensation) increased 3% to $7,132 in 2020, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense for financial advisors and home office and branch associates, partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses in 2020 primarily as a result of reductions in the following areas: discretionary spending, travel, legal, strategic firm initiatives and real estate projects. Financial advisor compensation and benefits expense increased primarily due to an increase in revenues on which commissions are earned, growth in the number of financial advisors and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees. Home office and branch compensation and benefits expense increased primarily due to higher wages in 2020.\nPART II\nIncluded in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements are additional discussions of the Partnership's accounting policies.\n (1) Counted on a full-time equivalent basis. \nThe following table summarizes the Partnership's portion of long-term rental commitments that are non-cancellable as of December 31, 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, these commitments may fluctuate based on changing business needs and conditions. For further disclosure regarding rental commitments, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMany of the same banks that provide financing to limited partners also provide financing to the Partnership. To the extent these banks increase credit available to the partners, financing available to the Partnership may be reduced.\nThe Partnership does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements.\nPART II\nIn addition to the above table, the Partnership had the 2018 Credit Facility outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, the Partnership would incur termination fees of approximately $103 at December 31, 2020 in the event the Partnership terminated existing contractual commitments with certain vendors providing ongoing services primarily for information technology, operations and marketing. These termination fees will decrease over the related contract periods, which generally expire within the next three years.\nSee Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risk Related to the Partnership's Business - Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives, for a discussion of several proposed, potential and recently enacted Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives that the Partnership is continuing to monitor.\nPART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nPART II\n2020 vs. 2019\nIn 2020, the Partnership implemented a temporary pause on certain strategic firm initiatives to help control costs in response to COVID-19, which reduced the actual capital expenditures to $129 from the 2020 estimate of $175. The Partnership estimates 2021 capital spending of approximately $225 as the pause on certain strategic firm initiatives has been lifted, and the Partnership expects to invest in software and other technology upgrades, real estate and construction and facilities improvements at various branch offices.\nCanada\nPART II\nThe Partnership's growth in capital has historically been the result of the sale of Interests to its associates and existing limited partners, the sale of subordinated limited partnership interests to its current or retiring general partners, and retention of a portion of general partner earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Partnership had $1,125 in cash and cash equivalents and $1,714 in securities purchased under agreements to resell, which generally have maturities of less than one week. This totaled $2,839 of Partnership liquidity as of December 31, 2020, a 5% ($132) increase from $2,707 at December 31, 2019. The Partnership had $17,918 and $10,387 in cash and investments segregated under federal regulations as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was not available for general use. As of December 31, 2020, the Partnership held $971 in U.S. treasuries to help facilitate cash management and maintain firm liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, $12,051 of the cash and investments segregated under federal regulations balance consisted of U.S. treasuries, compared with $3,394 as of December 31, 2019. Given global health, market, employment and economic uncertainty from COVID-19, the Partnership increased the proportion of U.S. treasuries to focus on principal protection of the portfolio. The increase in cash and investments segregated under federal regulations was primarily due to an increase in cash held in clients' accounts, resulting in a corresponding increase in payables to clients. Changes in cash were also due to timing of daily client cash activity in relation to the weekly segregation requirement.\nNet revenue increased 7% to $10,063 in 2020 compared to 2019. Results reflected an 11% increase in asset-based fee revenue, primarily due to the cumulative impact of net asset inflows into advisory programs in both 2020 and 2019, as well as average market increases. The increase in net revenue also reflected 9% growth in trade revenue due to an increase in the overall margin earned. The increase in net revenue was partially offset by the decrease in net interest and dividends revenue. Net interest and dividends revenue decreased due to the low interest rates throughout most of 2020 compared to 2019.\n2020 vs. 2019\n\nThe increase in trade revenue in 2020 was due to an increase in commissions revenue, partially offset by a decrease in principal transactions revenue. Commissions revenue increased primarily due to higher overall margins from a change in product mix with a higher proportion of client dollars invested in equities and mutual funds, which earn higher margins than principal transaction products, although margins on mutual funds and equities have been decreasing due to changes in the mutual fund fee structures and higher volume equity trades. Principal transactions revenue decreased as a result of a decrease in client dollars invested, due to the decline in interest rates on those products during 2020 compared to the prior year. The increase in trade revenue also reflected significant increases in first quarter trade revenue as the Partnership experienced a significant increase in client dollars invested in equities due to lower securities prices as global markets became increasingly volatile in the second half of March 2020 due to the uncertainties surrounding the impacts of COVID-19.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nTrade revenue, which consists of commissions and principal transactions, increased 9% to $1,719 during 2020. A discussion of trade revenue components follows.\n2020 vs. 2019\n\nThe Partnership plans to continue to grow its impact by focusing on hiring both experienced financial advisors and non-licensed candidates in future periods and increasing the number of clients and communities it serves. Currently, the Partnership is gradually restarting hiring to enable it to prioritize support for all financial advisors, which may result in fewer financial advisors hired than historically experienced. The Partnership is committed to an innovative and intentional strategy that offers a plan and resources for both current financial advisors and new hires. Additionally, the Partnership continues to make investments in virtual business enablement tools to help its branch teams be successful with the ongoing limitations on in-person client prospecting and consultations.\n (2) 2018 asset values were reclassified to conform to current year presentation. \n (2) Net new assets represents cash and securities inflows and outflows from new and existing clients and excludes mutual fund capital gain distributions received by U.S. clients. \nThe Partnership makes loans available to those general partners and, in limited circumstances, subordinated limited partners (in each case, other than members of the Executive Committee) who require financing for some or all of their Partnership capital contributions. In limited circumstances a general partner may withdraw from the Partnership and become a subordinated limited partner while he or she still has an outstanding Partnership loan. It is anticipated that, of the future general and subordinated limited partnership capital contributions (in each case, other than for Executive Committee members) requiring financing, the majority will be financed through Partnership loans. Loans made by the Partnership to such partners are generally for a period of one year but are expected to be renewed and bear interest at the interest rate defined in the loan documents. The Partnership recognizes interest income for the interest earned related to these loans. Partners borrowing from the Partnership will be required to repay such loans by applying the earnings received from the Partnership to such loans, net of amounts retained by the Partnership, amounts distributed for income taxes and 5% of earnings distributed to the partner. The Partnership has full recourse against any partner that defaults on loan obligations to the Partnership. The Partnership does not anticipate that partner loans will have an adverse impact on the Partnership's short-term liquidity or capital resources.\nPART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nThe Partnership ended 2020 with a 3% increase in both financial advisors and net new assets to 19,225 and $66 billion, respectively, compared to 2019. Average client assets under care increased 9% in 2020 to $1,354 billion, due to increases in the market value of client assets and net new assets gathered during 2020 compared to 2019. Advisory programs' average assets under care increased 15% in 2020 to $471 billion due to the continued investment of client assets into advisory programs and higher average market levels compared to 2019.\nThe Partnership believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following critical policy requires estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nproceedings represents its estimate of probable losses, as determined under FASB ASC No. 450, Contingencies, after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the Partnership's experience with other legal and regulatory matters and discussions with legal counsel.\nOverall, the increase in net revenue, offset by the increase in operating expenses, generated income before allocations to partners of $1,285, an 18% increase from 2019.\n (1) Assets on which the Partnership earns asset-based fee revenue. The U.S. portion of consolidated asset-based fee revenue was 98% for each of the periods presented. \nVariable compensation expands and contracts in relation to the Partnership's related profitability and margin earned. A significant portion of the Partnership's profits is allocated to variable compensation and paid to associates in the form of bonuses and profit sharing. Variable compensation increased 26% to $1,414 in 2020 due to increases in the Partnership's profitability, including an increase in the number of profitable branches and an overall increase in branch profitability. Given the uncertainty of the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, the Partnership cannot reliably predict their effects on future profitability and variable compensation.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\n \nNet revenue increased 7% to $258 in 2020, primarily due to an increase in asset-based fee revenue. Asset-based fee revenue increased 10% to $174 in 2020, led by an increase in advisory programs fees largely due to the cumulative impact of net asset inflows into advisory programs, as well as higher average market levels in 2020 compared to 2019.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Partnership had $3,810 in cash, cash equivalents and highly liquid investments, consisting of securities purchased under agreements to resell, U.S. treasuries, certificates of deposit and a money market fund, $3,075 in Partnership capital and no debt. The Partnership has committed and uncommitted lines of credit in place should a liquidity need arise but has not drawn upon these lines. The Partnership believes that its financial position remains strong as it addresses the uncertainty of the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and, based on current information, does not anticipate any significant changes to its current liquidity or capital position.\nPART II\nNet interest and dividends revenue decreased 59% to $105 in 2020 due to interest rates remaining at record low levels since the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate to near zero in March 2020. Despite increases in short-term investment balances, interest revenue decreased due to the lower federal funds rate compared to the prior year. Interest revenue also decreased due to lower interest earned on lower client margin balances. The decrease in interest revenue was partially offset by a decrease in customer credit interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019. The majority of interest expense in 2020 consisted of the minimum 7.5% annual return on the face amount of limited partnership capital paid to limited partners. The 7.5% rate is fixed and is not impacted by the low interest rate environment.\nOperating expenses increased 6% to $8,778 in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses primarily as a result of reductions in the following areas: discretionary spending, travel, legal, strategic firm initiatives and real estate projects. Financial advisor compensation increased largely due to an increase in revenues on which commissions are earned, an increase in the number of financial advisors, and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees. Home office and branch compensation increased primarily due to higher wages.", "item_7_text": "PART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nRegulatory Requirements\nThe discussion below details the significant fluctuations and their drivers for each of the major categories of the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Income.\n (1) Client dollars invested for trade revenue represents the principal amount of clients' buy and sell transactions resulting in revenue and for advisory programs revenue represents the net of the inflows and outflows of client dollars into advisory programs. \nCash Activity\nThe Partnership uses the ratios of both the number of home office associates and the number of BOAs per 100 financial advisors, as well as operating expenses per financial advisor (excluding financial advisor compensation, variable compensation and fund sub-adviser fees), as key metrics in managing its costs. In 2020 the average number of home office associates and BOAs per 100 financial advisors decreased 5% and 4%, respectively. The operating expenses per financial advisor decreased 9%, due to a decrease in operating expenses (excluding financial advisor compensation, variable compensation and fund sub-advisor fees) and an increase in financial advisors.\nThe Partnership estimates approximately 30%, 30%, and 35% of its total revenue was derived from sales and services related to mutual fund and insurance products in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In addition, the Partnership derived 13%, 14% and 14% of its total revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, from one mutual fund company. The revenue generated from this company relates to business conducted with the Partnership's U.S. segment.\nThe Partnership's Canada broker-dealer subsidiary is a registered broker-dealer regulated by IIROC. Under the regulations prescribed by IIROC, the Partnership's Canada broker-dealer subsidiary is required to maintain minimum levels of risk-adjusted capital, which are dependent on the nature of the Partnership's Canada broker-dealer subsidiary's assets and operations.\nIn 2020, the Partnership also implemented temporary measures to optimize firm resources and control costs in response to COVID-19 that it has since discontinued, including hiring reductions, wage freezes for certain associates, and a pause on certain strategic firm initiatives and new branch and home office real estate projects. The impact of COVID-19, as well as the Partnership's response to it, continues to evolve and is uncertain.\nTrade Revenue\nBased on current information and if interest rates remain at record low levels, the Partnership expects lower net interest and dividends revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020.\n2020 vs. 2019\nNet Interest and Dividends\nCONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS\nThe Partnership remains committed to financial advisor growth to continue to serve existing clients and future clients and create a positive impact in our communities. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, the Partnership implemented measures to optimize firm resources and control costs, including a temporary pause on the recruitment of non-licensed financial advisors. Despite the temporary hiring pause, the Partnership grew the number of financial advisors 3% to 19,225 in 2020 compared to 2019.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nPART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nDue to the uncertainty of the impacts of COVID-19 throughout the year, the Partnership implemented measures to support the health and well-being of its clients and associates, as well as measures to optimize firm resources and control costs. The measures included a temporary hiring reduction, decreased discretionary spending and a travel halt, which helped increase the Partnership's profitability in 2020 compared to 2019. The Partnership continues to assess the measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBased on current information and if interest rates remain at record low levels, the Partnership expects lower net interest and dividends revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nThe Partnership continues to evaluate its cash management strategy. Banks have experienced a significant increase in cash deposits due to the market and economic uncertainty from COVID-19, which may impact the Partnership's ability to continue to find financial institutions at which to place funds for principal protection while earning a reasonable rate of return on those funds.\nThe Partnership has several ongoing measures in response to COVID-19 to support the health and well-being of its clients, partners and associates. The ongoing measures include, among other things, closure and phased reopening of branches to public access, establishing the technological capability for branches to serve clients remotely, virtually all home office associates working remotely with limited exceptions, temporary financial support for certain financial advisors, additional paid time off and medical plan benefits for associates related to COVID-19, and a travel halt. The Partnership is continuing to assess these and other existing measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may consider additional potential measures in response to further economic or market events. Further, in response to COVID-19, the Partnership continues to review its business continuity plans and has had ongoing conversations with third-party providers to ensure the viability of their business operations supporting the Partnership. The Partnership has not experienced any significant disruptions in providing services to clients.\nRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nU.S. net capital, Canada regulatory risk-adjusted capital and the related capital percentages may fluctuate on a daily basis. In addition, Trust Co. was in compliance with its regulatory capital requirements.\nPART II\nThe increase in operating expenses in 2020 was primarily due to compensation and benefits expense (described below) increasing 10% to $7,186 in 2020. This increase is partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses in 2020 primarily as a result of reductions in the following areas: discretionary spending, travel, legal, strategic firm initiatives and real estate projects.\nFinancial advisor compensation and benefits expense increased 8% in 2020 due to an increase in revenues on which commissions are earned, growth in the number of financial advisors and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees.\n\nCOVID-19\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nThe following table shows financial information for the Partnership's reportable segments.\n2020 versus 2019 Overview\nThe Partnership's financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which may require judgment and involve estimation processes to determine its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses which affect its results of operations.\nThe Partnership broadly categorizes its net revenues into four categories: fee revenue, trade revenue, net interest and dividends revenue (net of interest expense) and other revenue. In the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Income, fee revenue is composed of asset-based fees and account and activity fees. Asset-based fees are generally a percentage of the total value of specific assets in client accounts. These fees are impacted by client dollars invested in and divested from the accounts which generate asset-based fees and changes in market values of the assets. Account and activity fees and other revenue are impacted by the number of client accounts and the variety of services provided to those accounts, among other factors. Trade revenue is composed of commissions and principal transactions revenue. Commissions are earned from the purchase or sale of mutual fund shares and equities as well as the purchase of insurance products. Principal transactions revenue primarily results from the Partnership's distribution of and participation in principal trading activities in municipal obligations, over-the-counter corporate obligations, and certificates of deposit. Trade revenue is impacted by the number of financial advisors, trading volume (client dollars invested), mix of the products in which clients invest, size of trades, margins earned on the transactions and market volatility. Net interest and dividends revenue is impacted by the amount of cash and investments, receivables from and payables to clients, the variability of interest rates earned and paid on such balances, the number of Interests outstanding, and the balances of Partnership loans.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Partnership's $500 committed revolving line of credit (the \"2018 Credit Facility\") entered into in September 2018, the Partnership is required to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 35% and minimum Partnership capital, net of reserve for anticipated withdrawals and Partnership loans, of at least $1,884. In addition, Edward Jones is required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least $1,344 and minimum regulatory net capital of at least 6% of aggregate debit items as calculated under the alternative method. The Partnership has the ability to draw on various types of loans. The associated interest rate depends on the type of loan, duration of the loan, whether the loan is secured or unsecured and the amount of leverage. Contractual rates are based on an index rate plus the applicable rate. The 2018 Credit Facility is intended to provide short-term liquidity to the Partnership should the need arise. As of December 31, 2020, the Partnership was in compliance with all covenants related to the 2018 Credit Facility.\n (3) 2018 assets under care were reclassified to conform to current year presentation. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAdditionally, as disclosed in the Partnership's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 10, 2020, Penny Pennington, Managing Partner, announced the appointment of general partner Lisa Dolan, age 54, to the Partnership's Executive Committee. It was also announced that Ms. Dolan has been named Chief Operating Officer for Edward Jones with responsibility for leading Operations, Service, Firm Analytics, Strategic Enablement and Planning and Workplace Services. Ms. Dolan joined the Edward Jones Finance division in 2005 with responsibility for tax and partnership accounting. She was named a principal in 2007 after which her responsibilities have expanded to include financial and regulatory reporting, expenditure management, compensation accounting and finance systems. Ms. Dolan was appointed to the Partnership's Audit Committee in 2014. In 2016, she assumed responsibility for the Finance division.\n2020 vs. 2019\nHome office and branch compensation and benefits expense increased 4% in 2020, primarily due to higher wages. The average number of the Partnership's home office associates slightly increased in 2020 compared to 2019, and the average number of branch office administrators (\"BOAs\") increased 1% in 2020 compared to 2019.\nThe Partnership's capital subject to mandatory redemption at December 31, 2020, net of reserve for anticipated withdrawals, was $3,075, an increase of $118 from December 31, 2019. This increase in Partnership capital subject to mandatory redemption was primarily due to the retention of a portion of general partner earnings ($130), additional capital contributions related to limited partner, subordinated limited partner and general partner interests ($1, $49 and $163, respectively) and the net decrease in Partnership loans outstanding ($19), partially offset by the redemption of limited partner, subordinated limited partner and general partner interests ($13, $37 and $194, respectively). During each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Partnership retained 13.8% of income allocated to general partners.\nOVERVIEW\nThe following table sets forth the change in major categories of the Consolidated Statements of Income as well as several key related metrics for the last three years. Management of the Partnership relies on this financial information and the related metrics to evaluate the Partnership's operating performance and financial condition.\n\nOperating expenses (excluding variable compensation) increased 3% to $232 in 2020 due to an increase in financial advisor compensation attributable to growth in the number of financial advisors and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees.\nAccruals for Contingencies. The Partnership accrues when appropriate for potential losses that may arise out of various legal and regulatory matters, including arbitrations, class actions, other litigation, and examinations, investigations and proceedings by governmental authorities, SROs and other regulators, to the extent that the amount of such potential losses can be estimated, in accordance with FASB ASC No. 450, Contingencies. See Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 for further discussion of these items. The Partnership regularly monitors its exposures to potential losses. The Partnership's aggregate accrued liability with respect to litigation and regulatory\nSegment Information\nThe Partnership requires liquidity to cover its operating expenses, net capital requirements, capital expenditures, distributions to partners and redemptions of Partnership interests, as well as to facilitate client transactions. The principal sources for meeting the Partnership's liquidity requirements include existing liquidity and capital resources of the Partnership, discussed further below, and funds generated from operations. The Partnership believes that the liquidity provided by these sources will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months. Depending on conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Partnership will, from time to time, consider the issuance of debt and additional Partnership capital, the proceeds of which could be used to meet growth needs or for other purposes.\nOperating Expenses\nThe Partnership's net assets are primarily monetary, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, cash and investments segregated under federal regulations, firm-owned securities, and receivables, less liabilities. Monetary net assets are primarily liquid in nature and would not be significantly affected by inflation. Inflation and future expectations of inflation influence securities prices, as well as activity levels in the securities markets. As a result, profitability and capital may be impacted by inflation and inflationary expectations. Additionally, inflation's impact on the Partnership's operating expenses may affect profitability to the extent that additional costs are not recoverable through increased prices of services offered by the Partnership.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nPART II\nThe Partnership filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with the SEC on January 12, 2018, to register $450 of Interests issuable pursuant to the 2018 Plan. The Partnership issued approximately $380 million, $1 million and $3 million of Interests under the 2018 Plan in early 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. The remaining $66 million of Interests may be issued under the 2018 Plan at the discretion of the Managing Partner in the future. Proceeds from the offering under the 2018 Plan are expected to be used for working capital and general firm purposes and to ensure there is adequate general liquidity of the Partnership for future needs. The issuance of Interests reduces the Partnership's net interest income and profitability.\nLEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REFORM\nEXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CHANGES\nU.S.\nThe Partnership continues to assess its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event the Partnership begins to experience adverse impacts in response to further economic or market events, the Partnership may consider resuming or adopting measures to reduce future operating expenses.\nAs a result of its activities as a U.S. broker-dealer, Edward Jones is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule and capital compliance rules of the FINRA Rule 4110. Under the alternative method permitted by the rules, Edward Jones must maintain minimum net capital, as defined, equal to the greater of $0.25 or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. The net capital rules also provide that Edward Jones' partnership capital may not be withdrawn if the resulting net capital would be less than minimum requirements. Additionally, certain withdrawals of partnership capital require the approval of the SEC and FINRA to the extent they exceed defined levels, even though such withdrawals would not cause net capital to be less than minimum requirements.\nPART II\nSee Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statement and Supplementary Data - Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and the financial condition of the Partnership. Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Partnership's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For discussions surrounding the earliest of the three years presented below, refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. All amounts are presented in millions, except as otherwise noted.\nPartnership Capital\nNet revenue increased 7% to $9,805 in 2020, primarily due to an increase in asset-based fee revenue. Asset-based fee revenue increased 11% to $7,341 in 2020 led by an increase in advisory programs fees largely due to the cumulative impact of net asset inflows into advisory programs, as well as higher average market levels in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in net revenue also reflected growth in trade revenue of 9% to $1,667 in 2020 due to an increase in overall margin earned.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nGiven the global health, market, employment and economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Partnership cannot reliably predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on financial markets or its financial results, including how its clients, their trading activity, the financial markets or government regulators will respond to such uncertainty. As a result, the pandemic's effects on trade revenue are uncertain, and further economic or market events could have a negative impact. In addition, the pandemic's potential effects on the economy, market volatility and the Partnership's current and prospective clients could result in a reduction in client assets under care and slower net new asset growth, which could negatively impact future asset-based fee revenue.\nLines of Credit\nHistorically, neither the amount of Partnership capital financed with individual loans as indicated in the table above, nor the amount of partner withdrawal requests, has had a significant impact on the Partnership's liquidity or capital resources.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nAny partner may also choose to have individual banking arrangements for their Partnership capital contributions. Any bank financing of capital contributions is in the form of unsecured bank loan agreements and is between the individual and the bank. The Partnership does not guarantee these bank loans, nor can the partner pledge his or her partnership interest as collateral for the bank loan. The Partnership performs certain administrative functions in connection with its limited partners who have elected to finance a portion of their Partnership capital contributions through individual unsecured bank loan agreements from banks with whom the Partnership has other banking relationships. For all limited partner capital contributions financed through such bank loan agreements, each agreement instructs the Partnership to apply the proceeds from the redemption of that individual's capital account to the repayment of the limited partner's bank loan prior to any funds being released to the partner. In addition, the partner is required to apply Partnership earnings, net of any distributions to pay taxes, to service the interest and principal on the bank loan. Should a partner's individual bank loan not be renewed upon maturity for any reason, the Partnership could experience increased requests for capital liquidations, which could adversely impact the Partnership's liquidity. In addition, partners who finance all or a portion of their capital contributions with bank financing may be more likely to request the withdrawal of capital to meet bank financing requirements should the partners experience a period of reduced earnings. As a partnership, any withdrawals by general partners, subordinated limited partners or limited partners would reduce the Partnership's available liquidity and capital.\nTHE EFFECTS OF INFLATION\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\n (1) Total Partnership capital, as defined for this table, is before the reduction of Partnership loans and is net of reserve for anticipated withdrawals. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe following table shows the Partnership's capital figures for its U.S. and Canada broker-dealer subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nFee Revenue\nAs disclosed in the Partnership's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 4, 2020, Vincent J. Ferrari, general partner of the Partnership, member of the Partnership's Executive and Management Committees, Chairman of the Partnership's Audit Committee and the Partnership's Chief Administrative Officer, has retired after 17 years of service to Edward Jones and the Partnership effective December 31, 2020. Mr. Ferrari joined Edward Jones in 2003 as a senior director in Information Systems. He was named a principal in 2004 and Chief Information Officer in 2007.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nThe following table shows the composition of the Partnership's aggregate bank lines of credit in place as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018\nThere were no amounts outstanding on the 2018 Credit Facility or the uncommitted lines of credit as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. In addition, the Partnership did not have any draws against these lines of credit during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, except for periodically testing draw procedures.\n (4) Attrition % represents the number of financial advisors that left the firm during the year compared to the total number of financial advisors as of year end. \n (2) Operating expenses used in calculation represent total operating expenses less financial advisor compensation, variable compensation and fund sub-adviser fees. \nIn addition, the Partnership has multiple uncommitted secured lines of credit totaling $390 that are subject to change at the discretion of the banks. The Partnership also has an additional uncommitted line of credit where the amount and the associated collateral requirements are at the bank's discretion in the event of a borrowing. Based on credit market conditions and the uncommitted nature of these credit facilities, it is possible that these lines of credit could decrease or not be available in the future. Actual borrowing capacity on secured lines is based on availability of client margin securities or firm-owned securities, which would serve as collateral on loans in the event the Partnership borrowed against these lines.\nto assess performance. COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has resulted in significant uncertainty; however, based on current information, the Partnership expects COVID-19 to impact the future financial results of the segments similarly. The following table shows financial information for the Partnership's reportable segments.\n\nThe Partnership has two operating and reportable segments based upon geographic location, the U.S. and Canada. Canada segment information, as reported in the following table, is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Partnership's Canada operations. The U.S. segment information is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements less the Canada segment information as presented. Pre-variable income represents income before variable compensation expense and before allocations to partners. This is consistent with how management views the segments\nFee revenue, which consists of asset-based fees and account and activity fees, increased 10% in 2020 to $8,175. A discussion of fee revenue components follows.\nPART II\nIn the second half of March 2020, markets and interest rates experienced sudden declines due to the global uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic. While the federal funds rate remains near zero, markets during 2020 experienced a significant rebound compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020. However, the full extent of the pandemic and the global governmental response, vaccine distribution, and related impact on society and the economy are not yet known, and further economic or market events could negatively impact the Partnership's financial results in future periods.\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nPART II\nCapital Expenditures\nOverall asset-based fee revenue increased 11% to $7,515 in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a 15% increase in revenue from advisory programs fees. Growth in advisory programs fees was due to the continued investment of client assets in advisory programs and higher average market levels in 2020. The decrease in other asset-based fee revenue in 2020 reflected declines in cash solutions revenue, primarily from increased fee waivers in order to maintain a positive client yield on the Money Market Fund following the decrease in the federal funds rate to near zero in March 2020. If interest rates remain at record low levels, the Partnership expects to continue to incur fee waivers in order to maintain a positive client yield on the Money Market Fund, thereby reducing other asset-based fee revenue.\nSignificant reductions in these revenues due to changes in mutual fund fee structures that result in decreased margins earned, regulatory reform or other changes to the Partnership's relationship with mutual fund or insurance companies could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nUnder the terms of the Partnership Agreement, a partner's capital is required to be redeemed by the Partnership in the event of the partner's death or withdrawal from the Partnership, subject to compliance with ongoing regulatory capital requirements. In the event of a partner's death, the Partnership generally redeems the partner's capital within six months. The Partnership has restrictions in place which govern the withdrawal of capital. Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, limited partners requesting withdrawal from the Partnership are to be repaid their capital in three equal annual installments beginning no earlier than 90 days after their withdrawal notice is received by the Managing Partner. The capital of general partners requesting withdrawal from the Partnership is converted to subordinated limited partnership capital or, at the discretion of the Managing Partner, redeemed by the Partnership. Subordinated limited partners requesting withdrawal are repaid their capital in six equal annual installments beginning no earlier than 90 days after their request for withdrawal of contributed capital is received by the Managing Partner. The Partnership's Managing Partner has discretion to waive or modify these withdrawal restrictions and to accelerate the return of capital.\nOperating expenses increased 6% in 2020 to $8,778, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense. A discussion of operating expense components follows.\nMUTUAL FUNDS AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS\nPART II\n\nThe Partnership, while not a party to any partner unsecured bank loan agreements, does facilitate making payments of allocated income to certain banks on behalf of the limited partner. The following table represents amounts related to Partnership loans as well as bank loans (for which the Partnership facilitates certain administrative functions). Partners may have arranged their own bank loans to finance their Partnership capital for which the Partnership does not facilitate certain administrative functions and therefore any such loans are not included in the table.\nOperating expenses (excluding variable compensation) increased 3% to $7,132 in 2020, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense for financial advisors and home office and branch associates, partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses in 2020 primarily as a result of reductions in the following areas: discretionary spending, travel, legal, strategic firm initiatives and real estate projects. Financial advisor compensation and benefits expense increased primarily due to an increase in revenues on which commissions are earned, growth in the number of financial advisors and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees. Home office and branch compensation and benefits expense increased primarily due to higher wages in 2020.\nPART II\nIncluded in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements are additional discussions of the Partnership's accounting policies.\n (1) Counted on a full-time equivalent basis. \nThe following table summarizes the Partnership's portion of long-term rental commitments that are non-cancellable as of December 31, 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, these commitments may fluctuate based on changing business needs and conditions. For further disclosure regarding rental commitments, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMany of the same banks that provide financing to limited partners also provide financing to the Partnership. To the extent these banks increase credit available to the partners, financing available to the Partnership may be reduced.\nThe Partnership does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements.\nPART II\nIn addition to the above table, the Partnership had the 2018 Credit Facility outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, the Partnership would incur termination fees of approximately $103 at December 31, 2020 in the event the Partnership terminated existing contractual commitments with certain vendors providing ongoing services primarily for information technology, operations and marketing. These termination fees will decrease over the related contract periods, which generally expire within the next three years.\nSee Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risk Related to the Partnership's Business - Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives, for a discussion of several proposed, potential and recently enacted Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives that the Partnership is continuing to monitor.\nPART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nPART II\n2020 vs. 2019\nIn 2020, the Partnership implemented a temporary pause on certain strategic firm initiatives to help control costs in response to COVID-19, which reduced the actual capital expenditures to $129 from the 2020 estimate of $175. The Partnership estimates 2021 capital spending of approximately $225 as the pause on certain strategic firm initiatives has been lifted, and the Partnership expects to invest in software and other technology upgrades, real estate and construction and facilities improvements at various branch offices.\nCanada\nPART II\nThe Partnership's growth in capital has historically been the result of the sale of Interests to its associates and existing limited partners, the sale of subordinated limited partnership interests to its current or retiring general partners, and retention of a portion of general partner earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Partnership had $1,125 in cash and cash equivalents and $1,714 in securities purchased under agreements to resell, which generally have maturities of less than one week. This totaled $2,839 of Partnership liquidity as of December 31, 2020, a 5% ($132) increase from $2,707 at December 31, 2019. The Partnership had $17,918 and $10,387 in cash and investments segregated under federal regulations as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was not available for general use. As of December 31, 2020, the Partnership held $971 in U.S. treasuries to help facilitate cash management and maintain firm liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, $12,051 of the cash and investments segregated under federal regulations balance consisted of U.S. treasuries, compared with $3,394 as of December 31, 2019. Given global health, market, employment and economic uncertainty from COVID-19, the Partnership increased the proportion of U.S. treasuries to focus on principal protection of the portfolio. The increase in cash and investments segregated under federal regulations was primarily due to an increase in cash held in clients' accounts, resulting in a corresponding increase in payables to clients. Changes in cash were also due to timing of daily client cash activity in relation to the weekly segregation requirement.\nNet revenue increased 7% to $10,063 in 2020 compared to 2019. Results reflected an 11% increase in asset-based fee revenue, primarily due to the cumulative impact of net asset inflows into advisory programs in both 2020 and 2019, as well as average market increases. The increase in net revenue also reflected 9% growth in trade revenue due to an increase in the overall margin earned. The increase in net revenue was partially offset by the decrease in net interest and dividends revenue. Net interest and dividends revenue decreased due to the low interest rates throughout most of 2020 compared to 2019.\n2020 vs. 2019\n\nThe increase in trade revenue in 2020 was due to an increase in commissions revenue, partially offset by a decrease in principal transactions revenue. Commissions revenue increased primarily due to higher overall margins from a change in product mix with a higher proportion of client dollars invested in equities and mutual funds, which earn higher margins than principal transaction products, although margins on mutual funds and equities have been decreasing due to changes in the mutual fund fee structures and higher volume equity trades. Principal transactions revenue decreased as a result of a decrease in client dollars invested, due to the decline in interest rates on those products during 2020 compared to the prior year. The increase in trade revenue also reflected significant increases in first quarter trade revenue as the Partnership experienced a significant increase in client dollars invested in equities due to lower securities prices as global markets became increasingly volatile in the second half of March 2020 due to the uncertainties surrounding the impacts of COVID-19.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nTrade revenue, which consists of commissions and principal transactions, increased 9% to $1,719 during 2020. A discussion of trade revenue components follows.\n2020 vs. 2019\n\nThe Partnership plans to continue to grow its impact by focusing on hiring both experienced financial advisors and non-licensed candidates in future periods and increasing the number of clients and communities it serves. Currently, the Partnership is gradually restarting hiring to enable it to prioritize support for all financial advisors, which may result in fewer financial advisors hired than historically experienced. The Partnership is committed to an innovative and intentional strategy that offers a plan and resources for both current financial advisors and new hires. Additionally, the Partnership continues to make investments in virtual business enablement tools to help its branch teams be successful with the ongoing limitations on in-person client prospecting and consultations.\n (2) 2018 asset values were reclassified to conform to current year presentation. \n (2) Net new assets represents cash and securities inflows and outflows from new and existing clients and excludes mutual fund capital gain distributions received by U.S. clients. \nThe Partnership makes loans available to those general partners and, in limited circumstances, subordinated limited partners (in each case, other than members of the Executive Committee) who require financing for some or all of their Partnership capital contributions. In limited circumstances a general partner may withdraw from the Partnership and become a subordinated limited partner while he or she still has an outstanding Partnership loan. It is anticipated that, of the future general and subordinated limited partnership capital contributions (in each case, other than for Executive Committee members) requiring financing, the majority will be financed through Partnership loans. Loans made by the Partnership to such partners are generally for a period of one year but are expected to be renewed and bear interest at the interest rate defined in the loan documents. The Partnership recognizes interest income for the interest earned related to these loans. Partners borrowing from the Partnership will be required to repay such loans by applying the earnings received from the Partnership to such loans, net of amounts retained by the Partnership, amounts distributed for income taxes and 5% of earnings distributed to the partner. The Partnership has full recourse against any partner that defaults on loan obligations to the Partnership. The Partnership does not anticipate that partner loans will have an adverse impact on the Partnership's short-term liquidity or capital resources.\nPART II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\nThe Partnership ended 2020 with a 3% increase in both financial advisors and net new assets to 19,225 and $66 billion, respectively, compared to 2019. Average client assets under care increased 9% in 2020 to $1,354 billion, due to increases in the market value of client assets and net new assets gathered during 2020 compared to 2019. Advisory programs' average assets under care increased 15% in 2020 to $471 billion due to the continued investment of client assets into advisory programs and higher average market levels compared to 2019.\nThe Partnership believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following critical policy requires estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nproceedings represents its estimate of probable losses, as determined under FASB ASC No. 450, Contingencies, after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the Partnership's experience with other legal and regulatory matters and discussions with legal counsel.\nOverall, the increase in net revenue, offset by the increase in operating expenses, generated income before allocations to partners of $1,285, an 18% increase from 2019.\n (1) Assets on which the Partnership earns asset-based fee revenue. The U.S. portion of consolidated asset-based fee revenue was 98% for each of the periods presented. \nVariable compensation expands and contracts in relation to the Partnership's related profitability and margin earned. A significant portion of the Partnership's profits is allocated to variable compensation and paid to associates in the form of bonuses and profit sharing. Variable compensation increased 26% to $1,414 in 2020 due to increases in the Partnership's profitability, including an increase in the number of profitable branches and an overall increase in branch profitability. Given the uncertainty of the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, the Partnership cannot reliably predict their effects on future profitability and variable compensation.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued\n \nNet revenue increased 7% to $258 in 2020, primarily due to an increase in asset-based fee revenue. Asset-based fee revenue increased 10% to $174 in 2020, led by an increase in advisory programs fees largely due to the cumulative impact of net asset inflows into advisory programs, as well as higher average market levels in 2020 compared to 2019.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Partnership had $3,810 in cash, cash equivalents and highly liquid investments, consisting of securities purchased under agreements to resell, U.S. treasuries, certificates of deposit and a money market fund, $3,075 in Partnership capital and no debt. The Partnership has committed and uncommitted lines of credit in place should a liquidity need arise but has not drawn upon these lines. The Partnership believes that its financial position remains strong as it addresses the uncertainty of the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and, based on current information, does not anticipate any significant changes to its current liquidity or capital position.\nPART II\nNet interest and dividends revenue decreased 59% to $105 in 2020 due to interest rates remaining at record low levels since the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate to near zero in March 2020. Despite increases in short-term investment balances, interest revenue decreased due to the lower federal funds rate compared to the prior year. Interest revenue also decreased due to lower interest earned on lower client margin balances. The decrease in interest revenue was partially offset by a decrease in customer credit interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019. The majority of interest expense in 2020 consisted of the minimum 7.5% annual return on the face amount of limited partnership capital paid to limited partners. The 7.5% rate is fixed and is not impacted by the low interest rate environment.\nOperating expenses increased 6% to $8,778 in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses primarily as a result of reductions in the following areas: discretionary spending, travel, legal, strategic firm initiatives and real estate projects. Financial advisor compensation increased largely due to an increase in revenues on which commissions are earned, an increase in the number of financial advisors, and an increase in compensation related to supporting new financial advisors and trainees. Home office and branch compensation increased primarily due to higher wages.", "item_7_tables": "Table 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
