Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared and, unless otherwise stated, the information derived therefrom as presented in this discussion and analysis is presented, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon our current views, expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, among others, the risks described in the Risk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nAs used in this discussion and analysis, unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the Company,\u201d Innovus,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, consisting of Novalere, Inc. (Novalere), Semprae Laboratories, Inc. (Semprae), FasTrack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (FasTrack), Supplement Hunt, Inc. (Supplement Hunt), and Prime Savings Club, Inc. (Prime Savings Club).\nOverview\nWe are an emerging over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) consumer goods and specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the commercialization, licensing and development of safe and effective non-prescription medicine, consumer care products, supplements and medical devices to improve men's and women's health and vitality. Our products currently focus in six main categories including sexual health, pain management, general muscle health, respiratory, sleep, and diabetic care. We deliver innovative and unique health solutions of OTC medicines, devices, consumer and health products, and clinical supplements through four general channels including Direct to Consumer Marketing, E-Commerce, Retail/Wholesale, and International Distribution. Collectively these channels make up our proprietary Beyond Human\u00ae Sales & Marketing Platform, which was acquired 2016, and significantly expanded through the development of proprietary algorithms to target consumers and improve efficiency and return in 2018. We are dedicated to being a leader in developing and marketing new OTC and branded Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA\u201d) products, supplements and medical devices. We are actively pursuing opportunities where existing prescription drugs have recently, or are expected to, change from prescription (or Rx) to OTC. These Rx-to-OTC switches\u201d require Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) approval through a process initiated by the New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) holder.\nOur business model leverages our ability to (a) develop and build our current pipeline of proprietary products, and (b) to also acquire outright or in-license commercial products that are supported by scientific and/or clinical evidence, place them through our existing supply chain, retail and on-line (including our Amazon\u00ae, eBay\u00ae, Wish.com, Walmart.com\u00ae, and Walgreens.com on-line stores and our own product websites and platforms among other e-commerce business platforms) channels to tap new markets and drive demand for such products and to establish physician relationships.\nOur Strategy\nOur corporate strategy focuses on two primary objectives:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>Developing a diversified product portfolio of exclusive, unique and patented non-prescription OTC and branded ANDA drugs, devices, consumer health products, and clinical supplements through: (a) the introduction of line extensions and reformulations of either our or third-party currently marketed products; (b) the development of new proprietary OTC products, supplements and devices; and (c) the acquisition of products or obtaining exclusive licensing rights to market such products; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2. </td> <td>Building an innovative, U.S. and global sales and marketing model through direct to consumer approaches such as our proprietary Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform, the addition of new online platforms such as Amazon\u00ae, eBay\u00ae, Wish.com, Sears.com, Walmart.com\u00ae and Walgreens.com and commercial partnerships with established international complementary partners that: (a) generates revenue, and (b) requires a lower cost structure compared to traditional pharmaceutical companies, thereby increasing our gross margins. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>3. </td> <td>Developing and acquiring on-line marketplaces such as Supplementhunt.com and Primesavingsclub.com that focus on certain market segments such as lower priced, soon to expire supplement business with the Supplementhunt.com acquisition and with the select consumer product business through Primesavingsclub.com among others in which we sell third party, brand or non-branded products. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Products\nMarketed Products\nWe currently market and sell over 35 products in the U.S. and more than 10 in multiple countries around the world through our 12 international commercial partners. We have five core products which we define as having more than $1.0 million in annual sales or rapidly growing product. The following represents these core products:\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>Vesele\u00ae </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2. </td> <td>UriVarx\u00ae </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>3. </td> <td>FlutiCare\u00ae </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>4. </td> <td>Apeaz\u00ae </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>5. </td> <td> Diabasens\u00ae\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>6. </td> <td>Prostagorx\u00ae </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>7. </td> <td>Sensum\u00ae </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we currently expect to launch in the U.S. the following products in 2019, subject to the applicable regulatory approvals, if required:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>ThermoMax\u00ae is a hand cream with two strengths that provides up to eight hours of hand warming relief (second quarter of 2019); </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2. </td> <td>BreastLift\u2122 is a clinically tested cream to provide safe and natural way to firm sagging breasts (second quarter of 2019); </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>3. </td> <td>HealthiFeet\u00ae is a foot cream that provides foot warming relief (second quarter of 2019); </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>4. </td> <td>MZS Sleeping Aid\u2122 with Hemp-Derived THC-free oil and melatonin is in tincture form (launched in first quarter of 2019); </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>5. </td> <td>Trexar\u2122 is a supplement to provide neuropathy support and enhanced sensation (second quarter of 2019); </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>6. </td> <td>Musclin\u00ae is a proprietary supplement made of two FDA Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) approved ingredients designed to increase muscle mass, endurance and activity (second half of 2019).

Regenerum\u2122 is being developed for patients suffering from muscle wasting. We currently expect to launch this product in 2020 pending successful clinical trials in patients with muscle wasting or cachexia; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>8. </td> <td>Octiq\u2122 is an expected FDA ophthalmic OTC monograph compliant product for the treatment of eye redness and eye lubrication (late 2019/early 2020). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and Marketing Channels\nAs discussed, we currently have four main sales and marketing channels making up the Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform acquired in March 2016, which has resulted in the significant revenue growth to $24.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $8.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. We feel that these channels complement each other to enhance the Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. brand and awareness of our customers and provide us with the ability to use our sales and marketing in the most efficient way possible in acquiring new customers and maintaining those current customers.\nPrint and Direct Mail Marketing\nThrough our Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform, we have access to advertise in the vast majority of newspapers and magazines on a regular basis. We have developed our own proprietary algorithm which allows us to target customers looking for specific health products allowing us to increase the return on our investment and reduce the cost to acquire new customers. During 2018, we were able to expand our reach to Canada with the approval of twelve of our products by Health Canada and successfully expand our Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform.\nE-Commerce\nWe have an extensive on-line media channel through our Amazon\u00ae, NewEgg\u00ae, Walmart.com\u00ae, eBay\u00ae, Wish.com, and Walgreens.com sites in addition to our own InnovusPharma.com site along with sites for each of our products individually. Our expertise allows us to successfully drive product sales through proper marketing campaigns through third-party sites as well as through email marketing campaigns to increase traffic to our own sites. Additionally, we have recognized that maintaining a proper e-commerce presence allows those customers who read our advertisements in the newspapers and magazine or receive our direct mail another avenue to purchase products.\nRetail/Wholesale\nWe are continuously introducing our products to varieties of retail and wholesale partners to enhance the brand and product awareness for our customers. In 2018, we significantly increased our advertising expenses specifically in the Print and Direct Mail Marketing channel which, in turn, has had a direct positive impact to the success of products in retail. We intend to continue to demonstrate to our retail and wholesale partners the advantages of incorporating our products in their stores, especially due to our proprietary consumer targeted marketing approach that our print advertising allows us to achieve.\nInternational Distribution\nWe continue to work with our exclusive commercial partners outside of the U.S. that would be responsible for sales and marketing in those territories. We evaluate the performance of each of these partners to ensure a steady flow of consumer activity for each of our products. Our strategy outside the U.S. is to partner with companies who can effectively market and sell our products in their countries through their direct marketing and sales teams. The strategy of using our partners to commercialize our products is designed to limit our expenses and fix our cost structure, enabling us to increase our reach while minimizing our incremental spending.\nRecent Developments\nWest-Ward Pharmaceuticals Commercial Agreement\nIn May 2017, we entered into a commercial agreement with West-Ward Pharmaceuticals International Limited ( WWPIL\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC ( Hikma\u201d) (LSE: HIK) (NASDAQ Dubai: HIK) (OTC: HKMPY). Pursuant to the commercial agreement, WWPIL provided us with the rights to launch our branded, fluticasone propionate nasal spray USP, 50 mcg per spray (FlutiCare\u00ae), under WWPIL's FDA approved ANDA No. 207957 in the U.S. in mid-November 2017. The initial term of the commercial agreement is for two years, and upon expiration of the initial term, the agreement will automatically renew for subsequent one-year terms unless either party notifies the other party in writing of its desire not to renew at least 90 days prior to the end of the then current term. The agreement requires us to meet certain minimum product batch purchase requirements in order for the agreement to continue to be in effect. In the first quarter of 2019 we placed another purchase order and are currently in compliance with our minimum product batch purchase requirements required to maintain the agreement.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn March 15, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved to amend and restate the Company's Charter to affect a one-for-105 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, but not the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our Charter (the Reverse Split\u201d). The Annual Report, financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split.\nPrivate Placement\nOn January 3, 2019, the Company completed a sale of common stock and warrants under a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of 431,490 units ( Units\u201d) for $7.35 per unit, with each Unit consisting of (i) one share of common stock ( Shares\u201d), (ii) one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.35 per share ( Series A Warrant\u201d), and (iii) one warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.40 per share ( Series B Warrant\u201d) (the Private Placement\u201d); provided, however, that in order to ensure that the Investor's beneficial ownership did not exceed 9.99% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the Investor elected to exercise its right to purchase 200,637 prefunded warrants ( Series C Warrants,\u201d and together with the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, the Investor Warrants\u201d) in lieu of Shares as part of the Units, which Series C Warrants have a nominal exercise price of $0.105 per share. In addition, the Company issued Series B Warrants to purchase 32,362 shares of common stock, an amount equal to 7.5% of the aggregate number of Shares, including Series C Warrants, sold in the Private Placement, at an exercise price of $9.19 per share (the Placement Agent Warrants\u201d) to the designees of H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (the Placement Agent\u201d), the Company's sole placement agent, as compensation for its services in connection with the Private Placement.\nThe Investor Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance, subject to an issuance limitation set forth therein equal to the number of authorized and unreserved shares of our common stock available for issuance on the date thereof, and shall terminate as follows: (i) the Series A Warrants shall terminate 18-months from the date of the Reverse Split, (ii) the Series B Warrants shall terminate five and a half years from the date of the Reverse Split, and (iii) the Series C Warrants shall terminate at such time that they are exercised in full. In addition, each of the Investor Warrants contains a 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation, which may be increased up to 9.99% at the sole option of the Investor upon 61 day prior notice to the Company (the Beneficial Ownership Limitation\u201d), and which prevents the Investor from exercising the Investor Warrants in the event such exercise would cause the Investor's beneficial ownership of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock to exceed the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.\ufeff\nIn connection with the sale of the Units, the Company granted certain registration rights with respect to the Shares and shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Investor Warrants, pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement by and between us and the Investor (the Registration Rights Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to file a registration statement no later than 30 days after the Closing Date in order to register the Shares and shares of common stock underlying the Investor Warrants sold and issued in connection with the Private Placement which was filed on January 14, 2019 and declared effective on February 12, 2019. We also agreed to register the shares of common stock underlying the Placement Agent Warrants issued to the Placement Agent's designees as compensation for its services in connection with the Private Placement.\nAsset Purchase Agreement\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company completed an Asset Purchase Agreement ( APA\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets of Prime Consultants, LLC for a total cash payment of $343,000 (the Purchase Price\u201d). Of the total Purchase Price, the Company acquired $313,000 of inventory. Prime Consultants, LLC is an e-commerce business with sales of products primarily through the Amazon platform generating approximately $2.8 million in revenue in 2018.\nResults of Operations\nYear

net revenue of approximately $24.0 million and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in net revenue in 2018 was primarily the result of new product launches in late 2017 and 2018 as well as an increase in marketing spend through the sales and marketing platform acquired in the Beyond Human\u00ae asset acquisition in March 2016. Diabasens\u00ae was launched in the first quarter of 2018, and we recognized net sales of approximately $5.5 million during the fiscal year and established a subscription base of approximately $108,000 monthly as of December 31, 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2016 we launched UriVarx\u00ae and during 2017 we launched ProstaGorx\u00ae, Apeaz\u00ae and ArthriVarx\u00ae, three of the four of which were core products in fiscal 2018 and collectively recognized net sales of approximately $9.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $4.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and established a subscription base of approximately $137,000 monthly as of December 31, 2018. Two of our historical products, Vesele\u00ae and Sensum+\u00ae, also recognized continued growth in the year ended December 31, 2018, generating net revenue of $5.4 million compared with $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following represents the number of units of our top products shipped in North America during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> #\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NUMBER OF UNITS:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diabasens\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Urivarx\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apeaz\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>668.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vesele\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fluticare\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,159.7 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sensum\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Product Sales\nWe recognized cost of product sales of approximately $4.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cost of product sales includes the cost of inventory, shipping, internal and external fulfillment expenses and royalties. The increase in cost of product sales by 134% is a direct result in the overall percentage increase in product sales of 160% in comparing the fiscal 2018 and 2017. The increase in the gross margin of product sales to 81.1% in 2018 compared to 79.0% in 2017 is due to the transition of our fulfillment services from utilizing third party providers in 2017 to managing the process internally in 2018 as well as improvements in the cost of products negotiated with our manufacturers during the period. Additionally, the increase in our print and direct mail marketing spend during fiscal 2018 resulted in customers purchasing more units per order when compared to the typical purchases that occur on e-commerce platforms which results in a decrease in shipping expense per unit on average.\nResearch and Development\nWe recognized research and development expense of approximately $160,000 and $39,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was a result in additional cost for research of new products, quality testing of products, and additional clinical trials expense incurred in 2018 primarily related to Musclin.\nSales and Marketing\nWe recognized sales and marketing expense of approximately $17.2 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of print advertisements, direct mail marketing and sales and marketing support. The increase in sales and marketing expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is due to the increase in the number of products we integrated into the Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform. Additionally, our expansion of sales into the Canadian market, specifically in the second half of 2018, resulted in an increase in marketing expenses, as we introduced new products to that market.\nGeneral and Administrative\nWe recognized general and administrative expense of approximately $8.0 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation, investor relation expense, legal, accounting, public reporting costs and other infrastructure expense related to the launch of our products. Additionally, our general and administrative expense includes professional fees, insurance premiums and general corporate expense. The increase is primarily due to the increase in employee headcount from 12 full-time employees as of December 31, 2017 to 27 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018 resulting in an increase in compensation expenses of approximately $1.1 million, an increase of approximately $1.0 million in merchant fees and third-party e-commerce fees as result of the significant increase in revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, and general increases in insurance premiums, legal expenses, rent expense due to our larger office space lease.\nOther Income and Expense\nWe recognized interest expense of approximately $1.4 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest expense primarily includes interest related to our debt, amortization of debt discounts and the fair value of the embedded conversion feature derivative liability in excess of the proceeds allocated to the debt in 2017 (see Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report). Due to the shares, warrants and cash discounts provided to our lenders, the effective interest rate is significantly higher than the coupon rate. The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 is due to the increase in the note agreements entered into during the year to enable us to increase the sales and marketing throughout the period.\nWe recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The loss on debt extinguishment was the result of the securities exchange agreements entered into with certain Notes Payable holders. In exchange for the settlement of approximately $1.9 million in principal and interest, we issued 195,185 shares of our common stock to such holders, with an aggregate fair value of $2.9 million. As a result, the remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $0.3 million and the fair value of the common stock issued in excess of the debt settled of approximately $1.0 million were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss on debt extinguishment was the result of the securities exchange agreement entered into with a certain 2016 and 2017 Notes Payable holder, as well as, the required prepayment of the 2016 Notes from the cash proceeds received through the public equity offering in March 2017. In exchange for the settlement of approximately $0.7 million in principal and interest, we issued 108,884 shares of our common stock to such holder with an aggregate fair value of $1.1 million. As a result, the remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $17,000 and the fair value of the common stock issued in excess of the debt settled of approximately $0.4 million were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2017. Under the terms of the 2016 Notes Payable, we were required to prepay the outstanding principal and interest of the convertible debentures with the cash proceeds received from an equity offering with an offering price less than the current conversion price of the debentures of $0.25 per share, as well as incur a 10% prepayment penalty. As a result of the prepayment, the remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $0.4 million, the prepayment penalty of $0.1 million and the extinguishment of the embedded conversion feature derivative liability of $0.2 million were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe recognized a gain from the fair value adjustment for contingent consideration of approximately $0.2 million for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Fair value adjustment for contingent consideration consists primarily of the change in the fair value of the contingent ANDA shares of common stock issuable to individual members of Novalere Holdings, LLC in connection with our acquisition in 2015 and the royalty contingent consideration to Semprae.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognized a provision for income taxes of $0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $8.3 million, or $(4.16) basic and diluted net loss per share, compared to a net loss for the same period in 2017 of $6.5 million, or $(4.32) basic and diluted net loss per share.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, we have funded losses from operations through the sale of equity and issuance of debt instruments. Combined with revenue, these funds have provided us with the capital to operate our business, to sell and support our products, attract and retain key personnel, and add new products to our portfolio. To date, we have experienced net losses each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $43.9 million and a working capital deficit of $2.3 million.\nAs of March 29, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 million in cash and $0.6 million held by processors. Although no assurances can be given, we currently plan to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities. We expect, however, that our existing capital resources, the proceeds received from the private placement offering and issuance of notes payable in the first quarter of 2019 totaling $2.7 million (see Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), revenue from sales of our products and upcoming new product launches and sales milestone payments from the commercial partners signed for our products, and equity instruments available to pay certain vendors and consultants, will be sufficient to allow us to continue our operations, commence the product development process and launch selected products through at least the next 12 months. In addition, the Company's CEO, who is also a significant shareholder, has deferred the remaining payment of his salary earned through June 30, 2016 of $1.2 million and will continue to defer such compensation if payment would jeopardize the ability of the Company to continue its operations.\nOur principle debt instruments include the following:\nJanuary and March 2018 Notes Payable\nOn January 8, 2018, January 30, 2018, March 1, 2018 and March 2, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with three unrelated third-party investors, pursuant to which the investors loaned the Company gross proceeds of $678,000 in January 2018 and $550,000 in March 2018 pursuant to 0% promissory notes ( January and March 2018 Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an Original Issue Discount ( OID\u201d) of $269,000 and bear interest at the rate of 0% per annum. The principal amount of $1.5 million is to be repaid in twelve equal monthly installments. Monthly installments of $68,000 began in February 2018 and are due through January 2019 and monthly installments of $56,000 began in April 2018 and are due through March 2019. The effective interest rate is 22% per annum for the January and March 2018 Notes Payable.\nIn connection with the January and March 2018 Notes Payable, we issued the investors restricted shares of our common stock totaling 27,211 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the January and March 2018 Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $227,000 in January 2018 and $188,000 in March 2018. In connection with the financing, we issued 5,918 restricted shares of our common stock in January 2018, and 2,998 restricted shares of common stock in March 2018 to a third-party consultant.

The increase in the cash used by operating activities of approximately $3.7 million is due primarily from an increase in the net loss of $1.8 million, a net reduction in working capital of $2.4 million and a reduction in stock compensation expenses issued to employees, the board of directors and consultants of $0.6 million offset by increases of $1.2 million consisting primarily from additional loss on the extinguishment of debt and the amortization of debt discount both relating to our issued notes payable.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities was approximately $494,000, which consisted of the purchase of property and equipment for the corporate office as well as the cash used for the acquisitions in 2018.

Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 was approximately $3.2 million, consisting primarily of the net proceeds from the public equity offering of $3.3 million and notes payable of $1.7 million, offset by the repayment of convertible debentures of approximately $1.2 million, notes payable and short-term loans payable of $0.5 million, and the prepayment penalty on the repayment of the convertible debentures of $0.1 million.\nSources of Capital\nOur operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity and issuance of debt instruments and revenues generated from the launch of our products and commercial partnerships signed for the sale and distribution of our products domestic and internationally. These funds have provided us with the resources to operate our business, sell and support our products, attract and retain key personnel and add new products to our portfolio. We have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $43.9 million and a working capital deficit of $2.3 million.\nWe have raised funds through the issuance of debt and the sale of common stock. We have also issued equity instruments in certain circumstances to pay for services from vendors and consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately $2.9 million in funds from the exercise of warrants and an aggregate of $5.8 million from the issuance of notes payable and short-term loans payable. These funds were primarily utilized for working capital purposes. The outstanding notes payable and short-term loans payable principal balance at December 31, 2018 was approximately $3.3 million.\nOur actual needs will depend on numerous factors, including timing of introducing our products to the marketplace, our ability to attract additional Ex-U.S. distributors for our products and our ability to in-license in non-partnered territories and/or develop new product candidates. In addition, we continue to seek new licensing agreements from third-party vendors to commercialize our products in territories outside the U.S., which could result in upfront, milestone, royalty and/or other payments.\nWe currently intend to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities to provide additional working capital, for further expansion and development of our business, and to meet current obligations, although no assurances can be given. If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and the newly issued equity or debt securities may have more favorable terms or rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we raise funds by incurring additional debt, we may be required to pay significant interest expense and our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization may increase. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming they would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments and may impose restrictions on our activities, such as financial and operating covenants. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing transactions, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expense and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expense in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which would adversely impact our financial results. We may be unable to obtain financing when necessary as a result of, among other things, our performance, general economic conditions, conditions in the pharmaceuticals industries, or our operating history. In addition, the fact that we are not and have never been profitable could further impact the availability or cost to us of future financings. As a result, sufficient funds may not be available when needed from any source or, if available, such funds may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise funds to satisfy our capital needs when needed, then we may need to forego pursuit of potentially valuable development or acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan, which would require us to modify our operations to reduce spending to a sustainable level by, among other things, delaying, scaling back or eliminating some or all of our ongoing or planned investments in corporate infrastructure, business development, sales and marketing and other activities, or we may be forced to discontinue our operations entirely.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates\nThe SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management's view, important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and demanding of management's judgment. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve the use of more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and any changes in the assumptions used in making the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The new guidance sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model, which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in U.S. GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance.\nWe reviewed all contracts at the date of initial application and elected to use the modified retrospective transition method, where the cumulative effect of the initial application is recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018. Therefore, comparative prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, ( ASC 605\u201d). The adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance was immaterial to our condensed consolidated statements of operations, balance sheet, and cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer. A contract with a customer exists when we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to the customer. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or service that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods or service to the customer.\nProduct Sales: Our principal activities from which we generate our revenue are product sales. We ship products directly to consumers pursuant to phone or online orders and to our wholesale and retail customers pursuant to purchase agreements or sales orders. The contract is based on either the acceptance of standard terms and conditions on the websites for e-commerce customers and via telephone with our third-party call center for our print media and direct mail customers, or the execution of terms and conditions contracts with retailers, distributors and wholesalers. These contracts define each party's rights, payment terms and other contractual terms and conditions of the sale. Consideration is typically paid prior to shipment via credit card or check when our products are sold direct to consumers or approximately 30 days from the time control is transferred when sold to wholesalers, distributors and retailers. We apply judgment in determining the customer's ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer's historical payment experience and, in some circumstances, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. We have concluded the sale of bottled finished goods and related shipping and handling are accounted for as the single performance obligation. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods to the customer. We issue refunds to e-commerce and print media customers, upon request, within 30 days of delivery. We estimate the amount of potential refunds at each reporting period using a portfolio approach of historical data, adjusted for changes in expected customer experience, including seasonality and changes in economic factors. For retailers, distributors and wholesalers, we do not offer a right of return or refund and revenue is recognized at the time products are shipped to customers. In all cases, judgment is required in estimating these reserves. Actual claims for returns could be materially different from the estimates. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation in a contract by transferring control over a product to a customer when product is shipped. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of product sales.\nLicense Revenue: The license agreements we enter into normally generate three separate components of revenue: (1) an initial payment due on signing or when certain specific conditions are met; (2) royalties that are earned on an ongoing basis as sales are made or a pre-agreed transfer price, and (3) sales-based milestone payments that are earned when cumulative sales reach certain levels. Revenue from the initial nonrefundable payments or licensing fee is recognized when all required conditions are met. If the consideration for the initial license fee is for the right to sell the licensed product in the respective territory with no other required conditions to be met, such type of nonrefundable license fee arrangement for the right to sell the licensed product in the territory is recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement. For arrangements with licenses that include sales-based royalties, including sales-based milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize royalty revenue and sales-based milestones at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied. The achievement of the sales-based milestone underlying the payment to be received predominantly relates to the licensee's performance of future commercial activities.\nService Revenue: During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a contract with a customer to provide sales, marketing, customer service, fulfillment, and storage services for a certain product which they have the rights to sell in Canada. The contract indicates that each of the services are provided as needed or as requested by the customer. The performance obligation is a promise to perform each of these services individually and therefore each service is considered to be distinct in the context of the contract. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and therefore revenue is recognized as the services are performed.\nCooperative Marketing Revenue: During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a contract with a broker to allow other companies to rent addresses from our list for their own marketing purposes. These companies do not obtain access to such lists, but rather the process is managed by a third-party broker. Only upon an individual purchasing a customer's product would the customer have visibility of the individual's information. In accordance with the contract, the broker will present an offer to us to rent certain lists from us. Upon our written approval, the broker will execute the rental and arrange for the requested marketing materials to be sent, which we consider the performance obligation. We recognize revenue when the rental is executed as indicated by the broker. Collection is managed by the broker and we apply judgment in determining the customer's ability and intention to pay.\nSales Allowances\nWe accrue for product returns, volume rebates and promotional discounts in the same period the related sale is recognized.\nOur product returns accrual is primarily based on estimates of future product returns over the period customers have a right of return, which is in turn based in part on estimates of the remaining shelf-life of products when sold to customers. Future product returns are estimated primarily based on historical sales and return rates. We estimate our volume rebates and promotional discounts accrual based on its estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain subject to these discounts. The estimate of the level of products in the distribution channel is based primarily on data provided by our customers.\nIn all cases, judgment is required in estimating these reserves. Actual claims for rebates and returns and promotional discounts could be materially different from the estimates.\nWe provide a customer satisfaction warranty on all of our products to customers for a specified amount of time after product delivery. Estimated return costs are based on historical experience and estimated and recorded when the related sales are recognized. Any additional costs are recorded when incurred or when they can reasonably be estimated.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Stock Based Compensation. All stock-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, warrants, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and restricted stock, are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based upon their estimated fair values. We use Black-Scholes to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards. The estimated fair value is determined at the date of grant. FASB ASC 718 requires that stock-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest. As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 as of January 1, 2017, we have made an entity-wide accounting policy election to account for forfeitures when they occur. There is no cumulative-effect adjustment as a result of the adoption of this ASU as our estimated forfeiture rate prior to adoption of this ASU was 0%.\nExcept for transactions with employees and directors that are within the scope of FASB ASC 718, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nEquity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Services\nOur accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows FASB guidance. As such, the value of the applicable stock-based compensation is periodically remeasured, and income or expense is recognized during the vesting terms of the equity instruments. The measurement date for the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued is the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the estimated fair value of the equity instrument is primarily recognized over the term of the consulting agreement. According to FASB guidance, an asset acquired in exchange for the issuance of fully vested, nonforfeitable equity instruments should not be presented or classified as an offset to equity on the grantor's balance sheet once the equity instrument is granted for accounting purposes. Accordingly, we record the estimated fair value of nonforfeitable equity instruments issued for future consulting services as prepaid expense and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations by recognizing the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair values on the acquisition date. The final purchase price may be adjusted up to one year from the date of the acquisition. Identifying the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired requires the use of estimates by management and was based upon currently available data. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, and acquired developed technologies and patents and discount rates utilized in valuation estimates.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Additionally, any change in the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date, including changes from events after the acquisition date, such as changes in our estimate of relevant revenue or other targets, will be recognized in earnings in the period of the estimated fair value change. A change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration or the occurrence of events that cause results to differ from our estimates or assumptions could have a material effect on the consolidated statements of operations, financial position and cash flows in the period of the change in the estimate.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe test our goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred, by comparing our reporting unit's carrying value to its implied fair value. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process as follows:\nStep 1. We compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including the existing goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation analysis. The carrying amount of each reporting unit is determined by specifically identifying and allocating the assets and liabilities to each reporting unit based on headcount, relative revenue or other methods as deemed appropriate by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and we then perform the second step of the impairment test. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required.\nStep 2. If further analysis is required, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and its liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nImpairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of the acquired business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other circumstances. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, it is required to record a write-down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the acquired assets. Changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact those judgments in the future and require an adjustment to the recorded balances.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to fifteen years. The useful life of the intangible asset is evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate assets for potential impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and fair value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held-for-sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet, if material.\nDerivative Liabilities\nCertain of our embedded conversion features on debt and issued and outstanding common stock purchase warrants, which have exercise price reset features and other anti-dilution protection clauses, were treated as derivatives for accounting purposes. The common stock purchase warrants were not issued with the intent of effectively hedging any future cash flow, fair value of any asset, liability or any net investment in a foreign operation. The warrants do not qualify for hedge accounting, and as such, all future changes in the fair value of these warrants were recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised, expire or the related rights have been waived. These common stock purchase warrants do not trade in an active securities market, and as such, we estimate the fair value of these warrants using a Probability Weighted Black-Scholes Model and the embedded conversion features using a Path-Dependent Monte Carlo Simulation Model.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. This ASU requires that when determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity's own stock. As a result, a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments, the amendments require entities that present earnings per share to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic earnings per share. The Company elected to use the modified retrospective transition method, where the cumulative effect of the initial application is recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption of this ASU, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated statement of financial position as of January 1, 2018 of $59,000 for the warrants previously classified as a derivative liability due to a down round provision included in the terms of the warrant agreement. Therefore, the cumulative-effect adjustment was recorded as a reduction in accumulated deficit and derivative liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional recent accounting pronouncements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSince our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "In connection with the September 2018 5% Notes Payable, the Company issued the investor restricted shares of common stock totaling 9,524 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the September 2018 5% Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $130,000. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Note.\nSales and Marketing\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate assets for potential impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and fair value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held-for-sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet, if material.\nOctober 2018 5% Notes Payable\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> #\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NUMBER OF UNITS:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diabasens\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Urivarx\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apeaz\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>668.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vesele\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fluticare\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,159.7 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sensum\u00ae\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed, we currently have four main sales and marketing channels making up the Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform acquired in March 2016, which has resulted in the significant revenue growth to $24.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $8.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. We feel that these channels complement each other to enhance the Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. brand and awareness of our customers and provide us with the ability to use our sales and marketing in the most efficient way possible in acquiring new customers and maintaining those current customers.\nPrint and Direct Mail Marketing\nReverse Stock Split\nCooperative Marketing Revenue: During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a contract with a broker to allow other companies to rent addresses from our list for their own marketing purposes.

We recognize revenue when the rental is executed as indicated by the broker. Collection is managed by the broker and we apply judgment in determining the customer's ability and intention to pay.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities was approximately $494,000, which consisted of the purchase of property and equipment for the corporate office as well as the cash used for the acquisitions in 2018. Cash used in investing activities in 2017 was approximately $58,000, which consisted of the purchase of property and equipment for our new corporate office location in December 2017, as well as a contingent royalty payment to Semprae for Zestra\u00ae product sales in 2016.\nRetail/Wholesale\nNet Cash Flows (dollars in thousands)\nProduct Sales: Our principal activities from which we generate our revenue are product sales.

A contract with a customer exists when we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to the customer. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or service that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods or service to the customer.\nOn November 6, 2018, November 8, 2018 and December 12, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with three unrelated third-party investors, pursuant to which the investors loaned the Company gross proceeds of $1.25 million pursuant to 0% promissory notes ( November and December 2018 Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $270,000 and require aggregate payments of $1.52 million in principal. The notes bear interest at the rate of 0% per annum.\nSales Allowances\nIn connection with the November and December 2018 Notes Payable, the Company issued the investors restricted shares of our common stock totaling 14,763 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the November and December 2018 Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $374,000 in November 2018 and $125,000 in December 2018. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the November and December 2018 Notes Payable.\nWe recognized research and development expense of approximately $160,000 and $39,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was a result in additional cost for research of new products, quality testing of products, and additional clinical trials expense incurred in 2018 primarily related to Musclin.\nOn October 22, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party investor in which the investor loaned the Company gross proceeds of $500,000 pursuant to 5% promissory notes ( October 2018 5% Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $50,000 and require payments of $550,000 in principal. The notes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and the principal amount and interest are payable at maturity on May 1, 2019.\nOn November 30, 2018, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement with one of the February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable holders. In connection with the securities exchange agreement, the Company issued a total of 20,940 shares of common stock in exchange for the settlement of principal due totaling $143,000. The fair value of the shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of the securities exchange agreements was determined to be $231,000. Due to the settlement of the principal balance of $143,000 into shares of common stock, the transaction was recorded as a debt extinguishment and the fair value of the shares of common stock issued in excess of the settled principal balance totaling $88,000 was recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two unrelated third-party investors in which the investors loaned the Company gross proceeds of $1.0 million pursuant to a 0% promissory note ( August 2018 Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $200,000 and require twelve payments of $100,000 in principal per month through August 2019. The August 2018 Notes Payable bear no interest per annum. The effective interest rate is 20% per annum for the notes.\nFebruary and March 2018 5% Notes Payable\nSales and Marketing Channels\nDerivative Liabilities\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The new guidance sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model, which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in U.S. GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance.\nIn connection with the note, the Company issued the investor restricted shares of common stock totaling 15,239 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the note. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in the Company recording a debt discount of $226,000. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the note.\nIn all cases, judgment is required in estimating these reserves. Actual claims for rebates and returns and promotional discounts could be materially different from the estimates.\nOn January 8, 2018, January 30, 2018, March 1, 2018 and March 2, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with three unrelated third-party investors, pursuant to which the investors loaned the Company gross proceeds of $678,000 in January 2018 and $550,000 in March 2018 pursuant to 0% promissory notes ( January and March 2018 Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an Original Issue Discount ( OID\u201d) of $269,000 and bear interest at the rate of 0% per annum. The principal amount of $1.5 million is to be repaid in twelve equal monthly installments. Monthly installments of $68,000 began in February 2018 and are due through January 2019 and monthly installments of $56,000 began in April 2018 and are due through March 2019. The effective interest rate is 22% per annum for the January and March 2018 Notes Payable.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands)\n 1. Developing a diversified product portfolio of exclusive, unique and patented non-prescription OTC and branded ANDA drugs, devices, consumer health products, and clinical supplements through: (a) the introduction of line extensions and reformulations of either our or third-party currently marketed products; (b) the development of new proprietary OTC products, supplements and devices; and (c) the acquisition of products or obtaining exclusive licensing rights to market such products; and 2. Building an innovative, U.S. and global sales and marketing model through direct to consumer approaches such as our proprietary Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform, the addition of new online platforms such as Amazon\u00ae, eBay\u00ae, Wish.com, Sears.com, Walmart.com\u00ae and Walgreens.com and commercial partnerships with established international complementary partners that: (a) generates revenue, and (b) requires a lower cost structure compared to traditional pharmaceutical companies, thereby increasing our gross margins. 3. Developing and acquiring on-line marketplaces such as Supplementhunt.com and Primesavingsclub.com that focus on certain market segments such as lower priced, soon to expire supplement business with the Supplementhunt.com acquisition and with the select consumer product business through Primesavingsclub.com among others in which we sell third party, brand or non-branded products. \nOur Products\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe recognized general and administrative expense of approximately $8.0 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation, investor relation expense, legal, accounting, public reporting costs and other infrastructure expense related to the launch of our products. Additionally, our general and administrative expense includes professional fees, insurance premiums and general corporate expense. The increase is primarily due to the increase in employee headcount from 12 full-time employees as of December 31, 2017 to 27 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018 resulting in an increase in compensation expenses of approximately $1.1 million, an increase of approximately $1.0 million in merchant fees and third-party e-commerce fees as result of the significant increase in revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, and general increases in insurance premiums, legal expenses, rent expense due to our larger office space lease.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nE-Commerce\nOur product returns accrual is primarily based on estimates of future product returns over the period customers have a right of return, which is in turn based in part on estimates of the remaining shelf-life of products when sold to customers. Future product returns are estimated primarily based on historical sales and return rates. We estimate our volume rebates and promotional discounts accrual based on its estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain subject to these discounts. The estimate of the level of products in the distribution channel is based primarily on data provided by our customers.\nAs of March 29, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 million in cash and $0.6 million held by processors. Although no assurances can be given, we currently plan to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities. We expect, however, that our existing capital resources, the proceeds received from the private placement offering and issuance of notes payable in the first quarter of 2019 totaling $2.7 million (see Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), revenue from sales of our products and upcoming new product launches and sales milestone payments from the commercial partners signed for our products, and equity instruments available to pay certain vendors and consultants, will be sufficient to allow us to continue our operations, commence the product development process and launch selected products through at least the next 12 months. In addition, the Company's CEO, who is also a significant shareholder, has deferred the remaining payment of his salary earned through June 30, 2016 of $1.2 million and will continue to defer such compensation if payment would jeopardize the ability of the Company to continue its operations.\nWe continue to work with our exclusive commercial partners outside of the U.S. that would be responsible for sales and marketing in those territories. We evaluate the performance of each of these partners to ensure a steady flow of consumer activity for each of our products. Our strategy outside the U.S. is to partner with companies who can effectively market and sell our products in their countries through their direct marketing and sales teams. The strategy of using our partners to commercialize our products is designed to limit our expenses and fix our cost structure, enabling us to increase our reach while minimizing our incremental spending.\nAsset Purchase Agreement\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in this annual report on Form 10-K (Annual Report). Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared and, unless otherwise stated, the information derived therefrom as presented in this discussion and analysis is presented, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon our current views, expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, among others, the risks described in the Risk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIn connection with the sale of the Units, the Company granted certain registration rights with respect to the Shares and shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Investor Warrants, pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement by and between us and the Investor (the Registration Rights Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to file a registration statement no later than 30 days after the Closing Date in order to register the Shares and shares of common stock underlying the Investor Warrants sold and issued in connection with the Private Placement which was filed on January 14, 2019 and declared effective on February 12, 2019. We also agreed to register the shares of common stock underlying the Placement Agent Warrants issued to the Placement Agent's designees as compensation for its services in connection with the Private Placement.\nThe following represents the number of units of our top products shipped in North America during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nNet Revenue\nResults of Operations\nService Revenue: During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a contract with a customer to provide sales, marketing, customer service, fulfillment, and storage services for a certain product which they have the rights to sell in Canada. The contract indicates that each of the services are provided as needed or as requested by the customer. The performance obligation is a promise to perform each of these services individually and therefore each service is considered to be distinct in the context of the contract. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and therefore revenue is recognized as the services are performed.\nStep 2. If further analysis is required, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and its liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nCost of Product Sales\nOverview\nAugust 2018 Notes Payable\nIncome Taxes\nThrough our Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform, we have access to advertise in the vast majority of newspapers and magazines on a regular basis. We have developed our own proprietary algorithm which allows us to target customers looking for specific health products allowing us to increase the return on our investment and reduce the cost to acquire new customers. During 2018, we were able to expand our reach to Canada with the approval of twelve of our products by Health Canada and successfully expand our Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform.\nWe recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss on debt extinguishment was the result of the securities exchange agreement entered into with a certain 2016 and 2017 Notes Payable holder, as well as, the required prepayment of the 2016 Notes from the cash proceeds received through the public equity offering in March 2017. In exchange for the settlement of approximately $0.7 million in principal and interest, we issued 108,884 shares of our common stock to such holder with an aggregate fair value of $1.1 million. As a result, the remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $17,000 and the fair value of the common stock issued in excess of the debt settled of approximately $0.4 million were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2017. Under the terms of the 2016 Notes Payable, we were required to prepay the outstanding principal and interest of the convertible debentures with the cash proceeds received from an equity offering with an offering price less than the current conversion price of the debentures of $0.25 per share, as well as incur a 10% prepayment penalty. As a result of the prepayment, the remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $0.4 million, the prepayment penalty of $0.1 million and the extinguishment of the embedded conversion feature derivative liability of $0.2 million were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity and issuance of debt instruments and revenues generated from the launch of our products and commercial partnerships signed for the sale and distribution of our products domestic and internationally. These funds have provided us with the resources to operate our business, sell and support our products, attract and retain key personnel and add new products to our portfolio. We have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $43.9 million and a working capital deficit of $2.3 million.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $8.3 million, or $(4.16) basic and diluted net loss per share, compared to a net loss for the same period in 2017 of $6.5 million, or $(4.32) basic and diluted net loss per share.\nWe test our goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred, by comparing our reporting unit's carrying value to its implied fair value. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process as follows:\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The loss on debt extinguishment was the result of the securities exchange agreements entered into with certain Notes Payable holders. In exchange for the settlement of approximately $1.9 million in principal and interest, we issued 195,185 shares of our common stock to such holders, with an aggregate fair value of $2.9 million. As a result, the remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $0.3 million and the fair value of the common stock issued in excess of the debt settled of approximately $1.0 million were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to fifteen years. The useful life of the intangible asset is evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life.\nSince our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.\nRecent Developments\nWe account for business combinations by recognizing the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair values on the acquisition date. The final purchase price may be adjusted up to one year from the date of the acquisition. Identifying the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired requires the use of estimates by management and was based upon currently available data. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, and acquired developed technologies and patents and discount rates utilized in valuation estimates.\nOn February 28, 2018 and March 28, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two unrelated third-party investors, pursuant to which the investors loaned the Company gross proceeds of $650,000 pursuant to 5% promissory notes ( February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $70,000 and require aggregate payments of $720,000 in principal. The notes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and the principal amount and interest are payable at maturity on October 28, 2018 for the note issued in February 2018 and in three installments on October 1, 2018, January 1, 2019 and April 1, 2019 for the note issued in March 2018.\nNet Loss\nOur Strategy\nInternational Distribution\nWe recognized a gain from the fair value adjustment for contingent consideration of approximately $0.2 million for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Fair value adjustment for contingent consideration consists primarily of the change in the fair value of the contingent ANDA shares of common stock issuable to individual members of Novalere Holdings, LLC in connection with our acquisition in 2015 and the royalty contingent consideration to Semprae.\nIn connection with the January and March 2018 Notes Payable, we issued the investors restricted shares of our common stock totaling 27,211 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the January and March 2018 Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $227,000 in January 2018 and $188,000 in March 2018. In connection with the financing, we issued 5,918 restricted shares of our common stock in January 2018, and 2,998 restricted shares of common stock in March 2018 to a third-party consultant. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued of $68,000 in January 2018 and $55,000 in March 2018 was recorded as a debt discount to the carrying value of the January and March 2018 Notes Payable. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the January and March 2018 Notes Payable.\nOur actual needs will depend on numerous factors, including timing of introducing our products to the marketplace, our ability to attract additional Ex-U.S. distributors for our products and our ability to in-license in non-partnered territories and/or develop new product candidates. In addition, we continue to seek new licensing agreements from third-party vendors to commercialize our products in territories outside the U.S., which could result in upfront, milestone, royalty and/or other payments.\nIn May 2017, we entered into a commercial agreement with West-Ward Pharmaceuticals International Limited ( WWPIL\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC ( Hikma\u201d) (LSE: HIK) (NASDAQ Dubai: HIK) (OTC: HKMPY). Pursuant to the commercial agreement, WWPIL provided us with the rights to launch our branded, fluticasone propionate nasal spray USP, 50 mcg per spray (FlutiCare\u00ae), under WWPIL's FDA approved ANDA No. 207957 in the U.S. in mid-November 2017. The initial term of the commercial agreement is for two years, and upon expiration of the initial term, the agreement will automatically renew for subsequent one-year terms unless either party notifies the other party in writing of its desire not to renew at least 90 days prior to the end of the then current term. The agreement requires us to meet certain minimum product batch purchase requirements in order for the agreement to continue to be in effect. In the first quarter of 2019 we placed another purchase order and are currently in compliance with our minimum product batch purchase requirements required to maintain the agreement.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOur business model leverages our ability to (a) develop and build our current pipeline of proprietary products, and (b) to also acquire outright or in-license commercial products that are supported by scientific and/or clinical evidence, place them through our existing supply chain, retail and on-line (including our Amazon\u00ae, eBay\u00ae, Wish.com, Walmart.com\u00ae, and Walgreens.com on-line stores and our own product websites and platforms among other e-commerce business platforms) channels to tap new markets and drive demand for such products and to establish physician relationships.\nWe recognized sales and marketing expense of approximately $17.2 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of print advertisements, direct mail marketing and sales and marketing support. The increase in sales and marketing expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is due to the increase in the number of products we integrated into the Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform. Additionally, our expansion of sales into the Canadian market, specifically in the second half of 2018, resulted in an increase in marketing expenses, as we introduced new products to that market.\nOn July 19, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party investor in which the investor loaned the Company gross proceeds of $500,000 pursuant to 5% promissory notes ( July 2018 5% Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $50,000 and require payments of $550,000 in principal. The notes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and the principal amount and interest are payable at maturity on February 19, 2019.\nIn connection with the August 2018 Notes Payable, we issued the investors restricted shares of common stock totaling 9,524 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the August 2018 Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $435,000. In connection with the financing, we issued 6,086 restricted shares to a third-party consultant. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued of $100,000 was recorded as a debt discount to the carrying value of the August 2018 Notes Payable. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the August 2018 Notes Payable.\nOur accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows FASB guidance. As such, the value of the applicable stock-based compensation is periodically remeasured, and income or expense is recognized during the vesting terms of the equity instruments. The measurement date for the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued is the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the estimated fair value of the equity instrument is primarily recognized over the term of the consulting agreement. According to FASB guidance, an asset acquired in exchange for the issuance of fully vested, nonforfeitable equity instruments should not be presented or classified as an offset to equity on the grantor's balance sheet once the equity instrument is granted for accounting purposes. Accordingly, we record the estimated fair value of nonforfeitable equity instruments issued for future consulting services as prepaid expense and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFinancing Activities\nOn July 31, 2018, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement with two of the January and March 2018 Notes Payable holders. In connection with the securities exchange agreement, the Company issued a total of 27,211 shares of common stock in exchange for the settlement of principal due totaling $300,000. The fair value of the shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of the securities exchange agreements was determined to be $440,000. Due to the settlement of the principal balance of $300,000 into shares of common stock, the transaction was recorded as a debt extinguishment and the fair value of the shares of common stock issued in excess of the settled principal balance totaling $140,000 and the unamortized debt discount as of the date of settlement of $100,000 were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nMarketed Products\nItem 7.\nOn November 6, 2018, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement with one of the January and March 2018 Notes Payable holders. In connection with the securities exchange agreement, the Company issued a total of 11,905 shares of common stock in exchange for the settlement of principal due totaling $100,000. The fair value of the shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of the securities exchange agreements, and was determined to be $133,000. Due to the settlement of the principal balance of $100,000 into shares of common stock, the transaction was recorded as a debt extinguishment and the fair value of the shares of common stock issued in excess of the settled principal balance totaling $33,000 and the unamortized debt discount as of the date of settlement of $24,000 were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n 1.

RegenerumTM is being developed for patients suffering from muscle wasting. We currently expect to launch this product in 2020 pending successful clinical trials in patients with muscle wasting or cachexia; and 8. OctiqTM is an expected FDA ophthalmic OTC monograph compliant product for the treatment of eye redness and eye lubrication (late 2019/early 2020). \nOn January 1, 2019, the Company completed an Asset Purchase Agreement ( APA\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets of Prime Consultants, LLC for a total cash payment of $343,000 (the Purchase Price\u201d). Of the total Purchase Price, the Company acquired $313,000 of inventory. Prime Consultants, LLC is an e-commerce business with sales of products primarily through the Amazon platform generating approximately $2.8 million in revenue in 2018.\nWe are an emerging over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) consumer goods and specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the commercialization, licensing and development of safe and effective non-prescription medicine, consumer care products, supplements and medical devices to improve men's and women's health and vitality. Our products currently focus in six main categories including sexual health, pain management, general muscle health, respiratory, sleep, and diabetic care. We deliver innovative and unique health solutions of OTC medicines, devices, consumer and health products, and clinical supplements through four general channels including Direct to Consumer Marketing, E-Commerce, Retail/Wholesale, and International Distribution. Collectively these channels make up our proprietary Beyond Human\u00ae Sales & Marketing Platform, which was acquired 2016, and significantly expanded through the development of proprietary algorithms to target consumers and improve efficiency and return in 2018. We are dedicated to being a leader in developing and marketing new OTC and branded Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA\u201d) products, supplements and medical devices. We are actively pursuing opportunities where existing prescription drugs have recently, or are expected to, change from prescription (or Rx) to OTC. These Rx-to-OTC switches\u201d require Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) approval through a process initiated by the New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) holder.\nExcept for transactions with employees and directors that are within the scope of FASB ASC 718, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nLicense Revenue: The license agreements we enter into normally generate three separate components of revenue: (1) an initial payment due on signing or when certain specific conditions are met; (2) royalties that are earned on an ongoing basis as sales are made or a pre-agreed transfer price, and (3) sales-based milestone payments that are earned when cumulative sales reach certain levels. Revenue from the initial nonrefundable payments or licensing fee is recognized when all required conditions are met. If the consideration for the initial license fee is for the right to sell the licensed product in the respective territory with no other required conditions to be met, such type of nonrefundable license fee arrangement for the right to sell the licensed product in the territory is recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement. For arrangements with licenses that include sales-based royalties, including sales-based milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize royalty revenue and sales-based milestones at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied. The achievement of the sales-based milestone underlying the payment to be received predominantly relates to the licensee's performance of future commercial activities.\nImpairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of the acquired business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other circumstances. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, it is required to record a write-down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the acquired assets. Changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact those judgments in the future and require an adjustment to the recorded balances.\nWe accrue for product returns, volume rebates and promotional discounts in the same period the related sale is recognized.\nOn September 12, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party investor in which the investor loaned the Company gross proceeds of $350,000 pursuant to 5% promissory notes ( September 2018 5% Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $40,000 and require payments of $390,000 in principal. The notes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and the principal amount and interest are payable in three installments on March 12, 2019, June 12, 2019 and September 12, 2019 for the note.\nWe currently intend to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities to provide additional working capital, for further expansion and development of our business, and to meet current obligations, although no assurances can be given. If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and the newly issued equity or debt securities may have more favorable terms or rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we raise funds by incurring additional debt, we may be required to pay significant interest expense and our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization may increase. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming they would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments and may impose restrictions on our activities, such as financial and operating covenants. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing transactions, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expense and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expense in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which would adversely impact our financial results. We may be unable to obtain financing when necessary as a result of, among other things, our performance, general economic conditions, conditions in the pharmaceuticals industries, or our operating history. In addition, the fact that we are not and have never been profitable could further impact the availability or cost to us of future financings. As a result, sufficient funds may not be available when needed from any source or, if available, such funds may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise funds to satisfy our capital needs when needed, then we may need to forego pursuit of potentially valuable development or acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan, which would require us to modify our operations to reduce spending to a sustainable level by, among other things, delaying, scaling back or eliminating some or all of our ongoing or planned investments in corporate infrastructure, business development, sales and marketing and other activities, or we may be forced to discontinue our operations entirely.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. This ASU requires that when determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity's own stock. As a result, a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments, the amendments require entities that present earnings per share to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic earnings per share. The Company elected to use the modified retrospective transition method, where the cumulative effect of the initial application is recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption of this ASU, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated statement of financial position as of January 1, 2018 of $59,000 for the warrants previously classified as a derivative liability due to a down round provision included in the terms of the warrant agreement. Therefore, the cumulative-effect adjustment was recorded as a reduction in accumulated deficit and derivative liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations.\nThe Investor Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance, subject to an issuance limitation set forth therein equal to the number of authorized and unreserved shares of our common stock available for issuance on the date thereof, and shall terminate as follows: (i) the Series A Warrants shall terminate 18-months from the date of the Reverse Split, (ii) the Series B Warrants shall terminate five and a half years from the date of the Reverse Split, and (iii) the Series C Warrants shall terminate at such time that they are exercised in full. In addition, each of the Investor Warrants contains a 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation, which may be increased up to 9.99% at the sole option of the Investor upon 61 day prior notice to the Company (the Beneficial Ownership Limitation\u201d), and which prevents the Investor from exercising the Investor Warrants in the event such exercise would cause the Investor's beneficial ownership of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock to exceed the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.\ufeff\nStep 1. We compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including the existing goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation analysis. The carrying amount of each reporting unit is determined by specifically identifying and allocating the assets and liabilities to each reporting unit based on headcount, relative revenue or other methods as deemed appropriate by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and we then perform the second step of the impairment test. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required.\nOther Income and Expense\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional recent accounting pronouncements.\nWe recognized cost of product sales of approximately $4.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cost of product sales includes the cost of inventory, shipping, internal and external fulfillment expenses and royalties. The increase in cost of product sales by 134% is a direct result in the overall percentage increase in product sales of 160% in comparing the fiscal 2018 and 2017. The increase in the gross margin of product sales to 81.1% in 2018 compared to 79.0% in 2017 is due to the transition of our fulfillment services from utilizing third party providers in 2017 to managing the process internally in 2018 as well as improvements in the cost of products negotiated with our manufacturers during the period. Additionally, the increase in our print and direct mail marketing spend during fiscal 2018 resulted in customers purchasing more units per order when compared to the typical purchases that occur on e-commerce platforms which results in a decrease in shipping expense per unit on average.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by financing activities was approximately $6.3 million, consisting primarily of the net proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $2.9 million and notes payable and short-term loans payable of $5.8 million, offset by the repayment of notes payable and short-term loans payable of approximately $2.3 million. Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 was approximately $3.2 million, consisting primarily of the net proceeds from the public equity offering of $3.3 million and notes payable of $1.7 million, offset by the repayment of convertible debentures of approximately $1.2 million, notes payable and short-term loans payable of $0.5 million, and the prepayment penalty on the repayment of the convertible debentures of $0.1 million.\nWe currently market and sell over 35 products in the U.S. and more than 10 in multiple countries around the world through our 12 international commercial partners. We have five core products which we define as having more than $1.0 million in annual sales or rapidly growing product. The following represents these core products:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates\nIn addition, we currently expect to launch in the U.S. the following products in 2019, subject to the applicable regulatory approvals, if required:\nHistorically, we have funded losses from operations through the sale of equity and issuance of debt instruments. Combined with revenue, these funds have provided us with the capital to operate our business, to sell and support our products, attract and retain key personnel, and add new products to our portfolio. To date, we have experienced net losses each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $43.9 million and a working capital deficit of $2.3 million.\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Stock Based Compensation. All stock-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, warrants, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and restricted stock, are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based upon their estimated fair values. We use Black-Scholes to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards. The estimated fair value is determined at the date of grant. FASB ASC 718 requires that stock-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest. As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 as of January 1, 2017, we have made an entity-wide accounting policy election to account for forfeitures when they occur. There is no cumulative-effect adjustment as a result of the adoption of this ASU as our estimated forfeiture rate prior to adoption of this ASU was 0%.\nOperating Activities\nIn connection with the October 2018 5% Notes Payable, the Company issued the investor restricted shares of common stock totaling 15,239 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the October 2018 5% Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $176,000. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Note.\nOn January 3, 2019, the Company completed a sale of common stock and warrants under a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of 431,490 units ( Units\u201d) for $7.35 per unit, with each Unit consisting of (i) one share of common stock ( Shares\u201d), (ii) one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.35 per share ( Series A Warrant\u201d), and (iii) one warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.40 per share ( Series B Warrant\u201d) (the Private Placement\u201d); provided, however, that in order to ensure that the Investor's beneficial ownership did not exceed 9.99% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the Investor elected to exercise its right to purchase 200,637 prefunded warrants ( Series C Warrants,\u201d and together with the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, the Investor Warrants\u201d) in lieu of Shares as part of the Units, which Series C Warrants have a nominal exercise price of $0.105 per share. In addition, the Company issued Series B Warrants to purchase 32,362 shares of common stock, an amount equal to 7.5% of the aggregate number of Shares, including Series C Warrants, sold in the Private Placement, at an exercise price of $9.19 per share (the Placement Agent Warrants\u201d) to the designees of H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (the Placement Agent\u201d), the Company's sole placement agent, as compensation for its services in connection with the Private Placement.\n</table>\nWe are continuously introducing our products to varieties of retail and wholesale partners to enhance the brand and product awareness for our customers. In 2018, we significantly increased our advertising expenses specifically in the Print and Direct Mail Marketing channel which, in turn, has had a direct positive impact to the success of products in retail. We intend to continue to demonstrate to our retail and wholesale partners the advantages of incorporating our products in their stores, especially due to our proprietary consumer targeted marketing approach that our print advertising allows us to achieve.\n\nWe have an extensive on-line media channel through our Amazon\u00ae, NewEgg\u00ae, Walmart.com\u00ae, eBay\u00ae, Wish.com, and Walgreens.com sites in addition to our own InnovusPharma.com site along with sites for each of our products individually. Our expertise allows us to successfully drive product sales through proper marketing campaigns through third-party sites as well as through email marketing campaigns to increase traffic to our own sites. Additionally, we have recognized that maintaining a proper e-commerce presence allows those customers who read our advertisements in the newspapers and magazine or receive our direct mail another avenue to purchase products.\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td>\nSeptember 2018 5% Notes Payable\nOur corporate strategy focuses on two primary objectives:\nPrivate Placement\nJanuary and March 2018 Notes Payable\n\nWest-Ward Pharmaceuticals Commercial Agreement\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was approximately $6.1 million compared with cash used in operating activities of approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in the cash used by operating activities of approximately $3.7 million is due primarily from an increase in the net loss of $1.8 million, a net reduction in working capital of $2.4 million and a reduction in stock compensation expenses issued to employees, the board of directors and consultants of $0.6 million offset by increases of $1.2 million consisting primarily from additional loss on the extinguishment of debt and the amortization of debt discount both relating to our issued notes payable.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nInvesting Activities\nOn October 8, 2018, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement with one of the February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable holders. In connection with the securities exchange agreement, the Company issued a total of 40,481 shares of common stock in exchange for the settlement of principal due totaling $340,000. The fair value of the shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of the securities exchange agreements was determined to be $485,000. Due to the settlement of the principal balance of $340,000 into shares of common stock, the transaction was recorded as a debt extinguishment and the fair value of the shares of common stock issued in excess of the settled principal balance totaling $145,000 and the unamortized debt discount as of the date of settlement of $3,000 were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n</td> </tr>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nResearch and Development\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve the use of more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and any changes in the assumptions used in making the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nJuly 2018 5% Note Payable\nWe recognized interest expense of approximately $1.4 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest expense primarily includes interest related to our debt, amortization of debt discounts and the fair value of the embedded conversion feature derivative liability in excess of the proceeds allocated to the debt in 2017 (see Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report). Due to the shares, warrants and cash discounts provided to our lenders, the effective interest rate is significantly higher than the coupon rate. The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 is due to the increase in the note agreements entered into during the year to enable us to increase the sales and marketing throughout the period.\nWe recognized net revenue of approximately $24.0 million and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in net revenue in 2018 was primarily the result of new product launches in late 2017 and 2018 as well as an increase in marketing spend through the sales and marketing platform acquired in the Beyond Human\u00ae asset acquisition in March 2016. Diabasens\u00ae was launched in the first quarter of 2018, and we recognized net sales of approximately $5.5 million during the fiscal year and established a subscription base of approximately $108,000 monthly as of December 31, 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2016 we launched UriVarx\u00ae and during 2017 we launched ProstaGorx\u00ae, Apeaz\u00ae and ArthriVarx\u00ae, three of the four of which were core products in fiscal 2018 and collectively recognized net sales of approximately $9.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $4.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and established a subscription base of approximately $137,000 monthly as of December 31, 2018. Two of our historical products, Vesele\u00ae and Sensum+\u00ae, also recognized continued growth in the year ended December 31, 2018, generating net revenue of $5.4 million compared with $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn connection with the February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable, we issued the investors restricted shares of our common stock totaling 14,143 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $94,000 in February 2018 and $129,000 in March 2018. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable.\nWe have raised funds through the issuance of debt and the sale of common stock. We have also issued equity instruments in certain circumstances to pay for services from vendors and consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately $2.9 million in funds from the exercise of warrants and an aggregate of $5.8 million from the issuance of notes payable and short-term loans payable. These funds were primarily utilized for working capital purposes. The outstanding notes payable and short-term loans payable principal balance at December 31, 2018 was approximately $3.3 million.\nGeneral and Administrative\nEquity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Services\nThe SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management's view, important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and demanding of management's judgment. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.\nWe recognized a provision for income taxes of $0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe provide a customer satisfaction warranty on all of our products to customers for a specified amount of time after product delivery. Estimated return costs are based on historical experience and estimated and recorded when the related sales are recognized. Any additional costs are recorded when incurred or when they can reasonably be estimated.\nWe reviewed all contracts at the date of initial application and elected to use the modified retrospective transition method, where the cumulative effect of the initial application is recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018. Therefore, comparative prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, ( ASC 605\u201d). The adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance was immaterial to our condensed consolidated statements of operations, balance sheet, and cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCertain of our embedded conversion features on debt and issued and outstanding common stock purchase warrants, which have exercise price reset features and other anti-dilution protection clauses, were treated as derivatives for accounting purposes. The common stock purchase warrants were not issued with the intent of effectively hedging any future cash flow, fair value of any asset, liability or any net investment in a foreign operation. The warrants do not qualify for hedge accounting, and as such, all future changes in the fair value of these warrants were recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised, expire or the related rights have been waived. These common stock purchase warrants do not trade in an active securities market, and as such, we estimate the fair value of these warrants using a Probability Weighted Black-Scholes Model and the embedded conversion features using a Path-Dependent Monte Carlo Simulation Model.\nNovember and December 2018 Notes Payable\n\nOn March 15, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved to amend and restate the Company's Charter to affect a one-for-105 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, but not the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our Charter (the Reverse Split\u201d). The Annual Report, financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Additionally, any change in the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date, including changes from events after the acquisition date, such as changes in our estimate of relevant revenue or other targets, will be recognized in earnings in the period of the estimated fair value change. A change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration or the occurrence of events that cause results to differ from our estimates or assumptions could have a material effect on the consolidated statements of operations, financial position and cash flows in the period of the change in the estimate.", "item_7_text": "In connection with the September 2018 5% Notes Payable, the Company issued the investor restricted shares of common stock totaling 9,524 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the September 2018 5% Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $130,000. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Note.\nSales and Marketing\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate assets for potential impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and fair value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held-for-sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet, if material.\nOctober 2018 5% Notes Payable\nAs discussed, we currently have four main sales and marketing channels making up the Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform acquired in March 2016, which has resulted in the significant revenue growth to $24.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $8.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. We feel that these channels complement each other to enhance the Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. brand and awareness of our customers and provide us with the ability to use our sales and marketing in the most efficient way possible in acquiring new customers and maintaining those current customers.\nPrint and Direct Mail Marketing\nReverse Stock Split\nCooperative Marketing Revenue: During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a contract with a broker to allow other companies to rent addresses from our list for their own marketing purposes. These companies do not obtain access to such lists, but rather the process is managed by a third-party broker. Only upon an individual purchasing a customer's product would the customer have visibility of the individual's information. In accordance with the contract, the broker will present an offer to us to rent certain lists from us. Upon our written approval, the broker will execute the rental and arrange for the requested marketing materials to be sent, which we consider the performance obligation. We recognize revenue when the rental is executed as indicated by the broker. Collection is managed by the broker and we apply judgment in determining the customer's ability and intention to pay.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities was approximately $494,000, which consisted of the purchase of property and equipment for the corporate office as well as the cash used for the acquisitions in 2018. Cash used in investing activities in 2017 was approximately $58,000, which consisted of the purchase of property and equipment for our new corporate office location in December 2017, as well as a contingent royalty payment to Semprae for Zestra\u00ae product sales in 2016.\nRetail/Wholesale\nNet Cash Flows (dollars in thousands)\nProduct Sales: Our principal activities from which we generate our revenue are product sales. We ship products directly to consumers pursuant to phone or online orders and to our wholesale and retail customers pursuant to purchase agreements or sales orders. The contract is based on either the acceptance of standard terms and conditions on the websites for e-commerce customers and via telephone with our third-party call center for our print media and direct mail customers, or the execution of terms and conditions contracts with retailers, distributors and wholesalers. These contracts define each party's rights, payment terms and other contractual terms and conditions of the sale. Consideration is typically paid prior to shipment via credit card or check when our products are sold direct to consumers or approximately 30 days from the time control is transferred when sold to wholesalers, distributors and retailers. We apply judgment in determining the customer's ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer's historical payment experience and, in some circumstances, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. We have concluded the sale of bottled finished goods and related shipping and handling are accounted for as the single performance obligation. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods to the customer. We issue refunds to e-commerce and print media customers, upon request, within 30 days of delivery. We estimate the amount of potential refunds at each reporting period using a portfolio approach of historical data, adjusted for changes in expected customer experience, including seasonality and changes in economic factors. For retailers, distributors and wholesalers, we do not offer a right of return or refund and revenue is recognized at the time products are shipped to customers. In all cases, judgment is required in estimating these reserves. Actual claims for returns could be materially different from the estimates. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation in a contract by transferring control over a product to a customer when product is shipped. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of product sales.\nAs used in this discussion and analysis, unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the Company,\u201d Innovus,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, consisting of Novalere, Inc. (Novalere), Semprae Laboratories, Inc. (Semprae), FasTrack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (FasTrack), Supplement Hunt, Inc. (Supplement Hunt), and Prime Savings Club, Inc. (Prime Savings Club).\nSources of Capital\nOur principle debt instruments include the following:\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer. A contract with a customer exists when we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to the customer. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or service that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods or service to the customer.\nOn November 6, 2018, November 8, 2018 and December 12, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with three unrelated third-party investors, pursuant to which the investors loaned the Company gross proceeds of $1.25 million pursuant to 0% promissory notes ( November and December 2018 Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $270,000 and require aggregate payments of $1.52 million in principal. The notes bear interest at the rate of 0% per annum.\nSales Allowances\nIn connection with the November and December 2018 Notes Payable, the Company issued the investors restricted shares of our common stock totaling 14,763 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the November and December 2018 Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $374,000 in November 2018 and $125,000 in December 2018. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the November and December 2018 Notes Payable.\nWe recognized research and development expense of approximately $160,000 and $39,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was a result in additional cost for research of new products, quality testing of products, and additional clinical trials expense incurred in 2018 primarily related to Musclin.\nOn October 22, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party investor in which the investor loaned the Company gross proceeds of $500,000 pursuant to 5% promissory notes ( October 2018 5% Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $50,000 and require payments of $550,000 in principal. The notes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and the principal amount and interest are payable at maturity on May 1, 2019.\nOn November 30, 2018, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement with one of the February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable holders. In connection with the securities exchange agreement, the Company issued a total of 20,940 shares of common stock in exchange for the settlement of principal due totaling $143,000. The fair value of the shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of the securities exchange agreements was determined to be $231,000. Due to the settlement of the principal balance of $143,000 into shares of common stock, the transaction was recorded as a debt extinguishment and the fair value of the shares of common stock issued in excess of the settled principal balance totaling $88,000 was recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two unrelated third-party investors in which the investors loaned the Company gross proceeds of $1.0 million pursuant to a 0% promissory note ( August 2018 Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $200,000 and require twelve payments of $100,000 in principal per month through August 2019. The August 2018 Notes Payable bear no interest per annum. The effective interest rate is 20% per annum for the notes.\nFebruary and March 2018 5% Notes Payable\nSales and Marketing Channels\nDerivative Liabilities\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The new guidance sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model, which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in U.S. GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance.\nIn connection with the note, the Company issued the investor restricted shares of common stock totaling 15,239 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the note. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in the Company recording a debt discount of $226,000. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the note.\nIn all cases, judgment is required in estimating these reserves. Actual claims for rebates and returns and promotional discounts could be materially different from the estimates.\nOn January 8, 2018, January 30, 2018, March 1, 2018 and March 2, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with three unrelated third-party investors, pursuant to which the investors loaned the Company gross proceeds of $678,000 in January 2018 and $550,000 in March 2018 pursuant to 0% promissory notes ( January and March 2018 Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an Original Issue Discount ( OID\u201d) of $269,000 and bear interest at the rate of 0% per annum. The principal amount of $1.5 million is to be repaid in twelve equal monthly installments. Monthly installments of $68,000 began in February 2018 and are due through January 2019 and monthly installments of $56,000 began in April 2018 and are due through March 2019. The effective interest rate is 22% per annum for the January and March 2018 Notes Payable.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands)\n 1. Developing a diversified product portfolio of exclusive, unique and patented non-prescription OTC and branded ANDA drugs, devices, consumer health products, and clinical supplements through: (a) the introduction of line extensions and reformulations of either our or third-party currently marketed products; (b) the development of new proprietary OTC products, supplements and devices; and (c) the acquisition of products or obtaining exclusive licensing rights to market such products; and 2. Building an innovative, U.S. and global sales and marketing model through direct to consumer approaches such as our proprietary Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform, the addition of new online platforms such as Amazon\u00ae, eBay\u00ae, Wish.com, Sears.com, Walmart.com\u00ae and Walgreens.com and commercial partnerships with established international complementary partners that: (a) generates revenue, and (b) requires a lower cost structure compared to traditional pharmaceutical companies, thereby increasing our gross margins. 3. Developing and acquiring on-line marketplaces such as Supplementhunt.com and Primesavingsclub.com that focus on certain market segments such as lower priced, soon to expire supplement business with the Supplementhunt.com acquisition and with the select consumer product business through Primesavingsclub.com among others in which we sell third party, brand or non-branded products. \nOur Products\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe recognized general and administrative expense of approximately $8.0 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation, investor relation expense, legal, accounting, public reporting costs and other infrastructure expense related to the launch of our products. Additionally, our general and administrative expense includes professional fees, insurance premiums and general corporate expense. The increase is primarily due to the increase in employee headcount from 12 full-time employees as of December 31, 2017 to 27 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018 resulting in an increase in compensation expenses of approximately $1.1 million, an increase of approximately $1.0 million in merchant fees and third-party e-commerce fees as result of the significant increase in revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, and general increases in insurance premiums, legal expenses, rent expense due to our larger office space lease.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nE-Commerce\nOur product returns accrual is primarily based on estimates of future product returns over the period customers have a right of return, which is in turn based in part on estimates of the remaining shelf-life of products when sold to customers. Future product returns are estimated primarily based on historical sales and return rates. We estimate our volume rebates and promotional discounts accrual based on its estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain subject to these discounts. The estimate of the level of products in the distribution channel is based primarily on data provided by our customers.\nAs of March 29, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 million in cash and $0.6 million held by processors. Although no assurances can be given, we currently plan to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities. We expect, however, that our existing capital resources, the proceeds received from the private placement offering and issuance of notes payable in the first quarter of 2019 totaling $2.7 million (see Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), revenue from sales of our products and upcoming new product launches and sales milestone payments from the commercial partners signed for our products, and equity instruments available to pay certain vendors and consultants, will be sufficient to allow us to continue our operations, commence the product development process and launch selected products through at least the next 12 months. In addition, the Company's CEO, who is also a significant shareholder, has deferred the remaining payment of his salary earned through June 30, 2016 of $1.2 million and will continue to defer such compensation if payment would jeopardize the ability of the Company to continue its operations.\nWe continue to work with our exclusive commercial partners outside of the U.S. that would be responsible for sales and marketing in those territories. We evaluate the performance of each of these partners to ensure a steady flow of consumer activity for each of our products. Our strategy outside the U.S. is to partner with companies who can effectively market and sell our products in their countries through their direct marketing and sales teams. The strategy of using our partners to commercialize our products is designed to limit our expenses and fix our cost structure, enabling us to increase our reach while minimizing our incremental spending.\nAsset Purchase Agreement\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in this annual report on Form 10-K (Annual Report). Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared and, unless otherwise stated, the information derived therefrom as presented in this discussion and analysis is presented, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon our current views, expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, among others, the risks described in the Risk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIn connection with the sale of the Units, the Company granted certain registration rights with respect to the Shares and shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Investor Warrants, pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement by and between us and the Investor (the Registration Rights Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to file a registration statement no later than 30 days after the Closing Date in order to register the Shares and shares of common stock underlying the Investor Warrants sold and issued in connection with the Private Placement which was filed on January 14, 2019 and declared effective on February 12, 2019. We also agreed to register the shares of common stock underlying the Placement Agent Warrants issued to the Placement Agent's designees as compensation for its services in connection with the Private Placement.\nThe following represents the number of units of our top products shipped in North America during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nNet Revenue\nResults of Operations\nService Revenue: During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a contract with a customer to provide sales, marketing, customer service, fulfillment, and storage services for a certain product which they have the rights to sell in Canada. The contract indicates that each of the services are provided as needed or as requested by the customer. The performance obligation is a promise to perform each of these services individually and therefore each service is considered to be distinct in the context of the contract. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and therefore revenue is recognized as the services are performed.\nStep 2. If further analysis is required, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and its liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nCost of Product Sales\nOverview\nAugust 2018 Notes Payable\nIncome Taxes\nThrough our Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform, we have access to advertise in the vast majority of newspapers and magazines on a regular basis. We have developed our own proprietary algorithm which allows us to target customers looking for specific health products allowing us to increase the return on our investment and reduce the cost to acquire new customers. During 2018, we were able to expand our reach to Canada with the approval of twelve of our products by Health Canada and successfully expand our Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform.\nWe recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss on debt extinguishment was the result of the securities exchange agreement entered into with a certain 2016 and 2017 Notes Payable holder, as well as, the required prepayment of the 2016 Notes from the cash proceeds received through the public equity offering in March 2017. In exchange for the settlement of approximately $0.7 million in principal and interest, we issued 108,884 shares of our common stock to such holder with an aggregate fair value of $1.1 million. As a result, the remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $17,000 and the fair value of the common stock issued in excess of the debt settled of approximately $0.4 million were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2017. Under the terms of the 2016 Notes Payable, we were required to prepay the outstanding principal and interest of the convertible debentures with the cash proceeds received from an equity offering with an offering price less than the current conversion price of the debentures of $0.25 per share, as well as incur a 10% prepayment penalty. As a result of the prepayment, the remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $0.4 million, the prepayment penalty of $0.1 million and the extinguishment of the embedded conversion feature derivative liability of $0.2 million were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity and issuance of debt instruments and revenues generated from the launch of our products and commercial partnerships signed for the sale and distribution of our products domestic and internationally. These funds have provided us with the resources to operate our business, sell and support our products, attract and retain key personnel and add new products to our portfolio. We have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $43.9 million and a working capital deficit of $2.3 million.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $8.3 million, or $(4.16) basic and diluted net loss per share, compared to a net loss for the same period in 2017 of $6.5 million, or $(4.32) basic and diluted net loss per share.\nWe test our goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred, by comparing our reporting unit's carrying value to its implied fair value. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process as follows:\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The loss on debt extinguishment was the result of the securities exchange agreements entered into with certain Notes Payable holders. In exchange for the settlement of approximately $1.9 million in principal and interest, we issued 195,185 shares of our common stock to such holders, with an aggregate fair value of $2.9 million. As a result, the remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $0.3 million and the fair value of the common stock issued in excess of the debt settled of approximately $1.0 million were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to fifteen years. The useful life of the intangible asset is evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life.\nSince our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.\nRecent Developments\nWe account for business combinations by recognizing the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair values on the acquisition date. The final purchase price may be adjusted up to one year from the date of the acquisition. Identifying the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired requires the use of estimates by management and was based upon currently available data. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, and acquired developed technologies and patents and discount rates utilized in valuation estimates.\nOn February 28, 2018 and March 28, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two unrelated third-party investors, pursuant to which the investors loaned the Company gross proceeds of $650,000 pursuant to 5% promissory notes ( February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $70,000 and require aggregate payments of $720,000 in principal. The notes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and the principal amount and interest are payable at maturity on October 28, 2018 for the note issued in February 2018 and in three installments on October 1, 2018, January 1, 2019 and April 1, 2019 for the note issued in March 2018.\nNet Loss\nOur Strategy\nInternational Distribution\nWe recognized a gain from the fair value adjustment for contingent consideration of approximately $0.2 million for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Fair value adjustment for contingent consideration consists primarily of the change in the fair value of the contingent ANDA shares of common stock issuable to individual members of Novalere Holdings, LLC in connection with our acquisition in 2015 and the royalty contingent consideration to Semprae.\nIn connection with the January and March 2018 Notes Payable, we issued the investors restricted shares of our common stock totaling 27,211 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the January and March 2018 Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $227,000 in January 2018 and $188,000 in March 2018. In connection with the financing, we issued 5,918 restricted shares of our common stock in January 2018, and 2,998 restricted shares of common stock in March 2018 to a third-party consultant. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued of $68,000 in January 2018 and $55,000 in March 2018 was recorded as a debt discount to the carrying value of the January and March 2018 Notes Payable. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the January and March 2018 Notes Payable.\nOur actual needs will depend on numerous factors, including timing of introducing our products to the marketplace, our ability to attract additional Ex-U.S. distributors for our products and our ability to in-license in non-partnered territories and/or develop new product candidates. In addition, we continue to seek new licensing agreements from third-party vendors to commercialize our products in territories outside the U.S., which could result in upfront, milestone, royalty and/or other payments.\nIn May 2017, we entered into a commercial agreement with West-Ward Pharmaceuticals International Limited ( WWPIL\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC ( Hikma\u201d) (LSE: HIK) (NASDAQ Dubai: HIK) (OTC: HKMPY). Pursuant to the commercial agreement, WWPIL provided us with the rights to launch our branded, fluticasone propionate nasal spray USP, 50 mcg per spray (FlutiCare\u00ae), under WWPIL's FDA approved ANDA No. 207957 in the U.S. in mid-November 2017. The initial term of the commercial agreement is for two years, and upon expiration of the initial term, the agreement will automatically renew for subsequent one-year terms unless either party notifies the other party in writing of its desire not to renew at least 90 days prior to the end of the then current term. The agreement requires us to meet certain minimum product batch purchase requirements in order for the agreement to continue to be in effect. In the first quarter of 2019 we placed another purchase order and are currently in compliance with our minimum product batch purchase requirements required to maintain the agreement.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOur business model leverages our ability to (a) develop and build our current pipeline of proprietary products, and (b) to also acquire outright or in-license commercial products that are supported by scientific and/or clinical evidence, place them through our existing supply chain, retail and on-line (including our Amazon\u00ae, eBay\u00ae, Wish.com, Walmart.com\u00ae, and Walgreens.com on-line stores and our own product websites and platforms among other e-commerce business platforms) channels to tap new markets and drive demand for such products and to establish physician relationships.\nWe recognized sales and marketing expense of approximately $17.2 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of print advertisements, direct mail marketing and sales and marketing support. The increase in sales and marketing expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is due to the increase in the number of products we integrated into the Beyond Human\u00ae sales and marketing platform. Additionally, our expansion of sales into the Canadian market, specifically in the second half of 2018, resulted in an increase in marketing expenses, as we introduced new products to that market.\nOn July 19, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party investor in which the investor loaned the Company gross proceeds of $500,000 pursuant to 5% promissory notes ( July 2018 5% Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $50,000 and require payments of $550,000 in principal. The notes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and the principal amount and interest are payable at maturity on February 19, 2019.\nIn connection with the August 2018 Notes Payable, we issued the investors restricted shares of common stock totaling 9,524 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the August 2018 Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $435,000. In connection with the financing, we issued 6,086 restricted shares to a third-party consultant. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued of $100,000 was recorded as a debt discount to the carrying value of the August 2018 Notes Payable. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the August 2018 Notes Payable.\nOur accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows FASB guidance. As such, the value of the applicable stock-based compensation is periodically remeasured, and income or expense is recognized during the vesting terms of the equity instruments. The measurement date for the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued is the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the estimated fair value of the equity instrument is primarily recognized over the term of the consulting agreement. According to FASB guidance, an asset acquired in exchange for the issuance of fully vested, nonforfeitable equity instruments should not be presented or classified as an offset to equity on the grantor's balance sheet once the equity instrument is granted for accounting purposes. Accordingly, we record the estimated fair value of nonforfeitable equity instruments issued for future consulting services as prepaid expense and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFinancing Activities\nOn July 31, 2018, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement with two of the January and March 2018 Notes Payable holders. In connection with the securities exchange agreement, the Company issued a total of 27,211 shares of common stock in exchange for the settlement of principal due totaling $300,000. The fair value of the shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of the securities exchange agreements was determined to be $440,000. Due to the settlement of the principal balance of $300,000 into shares of common stock, the transaction was recorded as a debt extinguishment and the fair value of the shares of common stock issued in excess of the settled principal balance totaling $140,000 and the unamortized debt discount as of the date of settlement of $100,000 were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nMarketed Products\nItem 7.\nOn November 6, 2018, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement with one of the January and March 2018 Notes Payable holders. In connection with the securities exchange agreement, the Company issued a total of 11,905 shares of common stock in exchange for the settlement of principal due totaling $100,000. The fair value of the shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of the securities exchange agreements, and was determined to be $133,000. Due to the settlement of the principal balance of $100,000 into shares of common stock, the transaction was recorded as a debt extinguishment and the fair value of the shares of common stock issued in excess of the settled principal balance totaling $33,000 and the unamortized debt discount as of the date of settlement of $24,000 were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n 1.

Of the total Purchase Price, the Company acquired $313,000 of inventory. Prime Consultants, LLC is an e-commerce business with sales of products primarily through the Amazon platform generating approximately $2.8 million in revenue in 2018.\nWe are an emerging over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) consumer goods and specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the commercialization, licensing and development of safe and effective non-prescription medicine, consumer care products, supplements and medical devices to improve men's and women's health and vitality. Our products currently focus in six main categories including sexual health, pain management, general muscle health, respiratory, sleep, and diabetic care. We deliver innovative and unique health solutions of OTC medicines, devices, consumer and health products, and clinical supplements through four general channels including Direct to Consumer Marketing, E-Commerce, Retail/Wholesale, and International Distribution. Collectively these channels make up our proprietary Beyond Human\u00ae Sales & Marketing Platform, which was acquired 2016, and significantly expanded through the development of proprietary algorithms to target consumers and improve efficiency and return in 2018. We are dedicated to being a leader in developing and marketing new OTC and branded Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA\u201d) products, supplements and medical devices. We are actively pursuing opportunities where existing prescription drugs have recently, or are expected to, change from prescription (or Rx) to OTC. These Rx-to-OTC switches\u201d require Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) approval through a process initiated by the New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) holder.\nExcept for transactions with employees and directors that are within the scope of FASB ASC 718, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nLicense Revenue: The license agreements we enter into normally generate three separate components of revenue: (1) an initial payment due on signing or when certain specific conditions are met; (2) royalties that are earned on an ongoing basis as sales are made or a pre-agreed transfer price, and (3) sales-based milestone payments that are earned when cumulative sales reach certain levels. Revenue from the initial nonrefundable payments or licensing fee is recognized when all required conditions are met. If the consideration for the initial license fee is for the right to sell the licensed product in the respective territory with no other required conditions to be met, such type of nonrefundable license fee arrangement for the right to sell the licensed product in the territory is recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement. For arrangements with licenses that include sales-based royalties, including sales-based milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize royalty revenue and sales-based milestones at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied. The achievement of the sales-based milestone underlying the payment to be received predominantly relates to the licensee's performance of future commercial activities.\nImpairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of the acquired business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other circumstances. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, it is required to record a write-down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the acquired assets. Changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact those judgments in the future and require an adjustment to the recorded balances.\nWe accrue for product returns, volume rebates and promotional discounts in the same period the related sale is recognized.\nOn September 12, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party investor in which the investor loaned the Company gross proceeds of $350,000 pursuant to 5% promissory notes ( September 2018 5% Notes Payable\u201d). The notes have an OID of $40,000 and require payments of $390,000 in principal. The notes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and the principal amount and interest are payable in three installments on March 12, 2019, June 12, 2019 and September 12, 2019 for the note.\nWe currently intend to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities to provide additional working capital, for further expansion and development of our business, and to meet current obligations, although no assurances can be given. If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and the newly issued equity or debt securities may have more favorable terms or rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we raise funds by incurring additional debt, we may be required to pay significant interest expense and our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization may increase. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming they would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments and may impose restrictions on our activities, such as financial and operating covenants. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing transactions, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expense and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expense in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which would adversely impact our financial results. We may be unable to obtain financing when necessary as a result of, among other things, our performance, general economic conditions, conditions in the pharmaceuticals industries, or our operating history. In addition, the fact that we are not and have never been profitable could further impact the availability or cost to us of future financings. As a result, sufficient funds may not be available when needed from any source or, if available, such funds may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise funds to satisfy our capital needs when needed, then we may need to forego pursuit of potentially valuable development or acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan, which would require us to modify our operations to reduce spending to a sustainable level by, among other things, delaying, scaling back or eliminating some or all of our ongoing or planned investments in corporate infrastructure, business development, sales and marketing and other activities, or we may be forced to discontinue our operations entirely.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. This ASU requires that when determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity's own stock. As a result, a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments, the amendments require entities that present earnings per share to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic earnings per share. The Company elected to use the modified retrospective transition method, where the cumulative effect of the initial application is recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption of this ASU, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated statement of financial position as of January 1, 2018 of $59,000 for the warrants previously classified as a derivative liability due to a down round provision included in the terms of the warrant agreement. Therefore, the cumulative-effect adjustment was recorded as a reduction in accumulated deficit and derivative liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations.\nThe Investor Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance, subject to an issuance limitation set forth therein equal to the number of authorized and unreserved shares of our common stock available for issuance on the date thereof, and shall terminate as follows: (i) the Series A Warrants shall terminate 18-months from the date of the Reverse Split, (ii) the Series B Warrants shall terminate five and a half years from the date of the Reverse Split, and (iii) the Series C Warrants shall terminate at such time that they are exercised in full. In addition, each of the Investor Warrants contains a 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation, which may be increased up to 9.99% at the sole option of the Investor upon 61 day prior notice to the Company (the Beneficial Ownership Limitation\u201d), and which prevents the Investor from exercising the Investor Warrants in the event such exercise would cause the Investor's beneficial ownership of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock to exceed the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.\ufeff\nStep 1. We compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including the existing goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation analysis. The carrying amount of each reporting unit is determined by specifically identifying and allocating the assets and liabilities to each reporting unit based on headcount, relative revenue or other methods as deemed appropriate by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and we then perform the second step of the impairment test. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required.\nOther Income and Expense\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional recent accounting pronouncements.\nWe recognized cost of product sales of approximately $4.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cost of product sales includes the cost of inventory, shipping, internal and external fulfillment expenses and royalties. The increase in cost of product sales by 134% is a direct result in the overall percentage increase in product sales of 160% in comparing the fiscal 2018 and 2017. The increase in the gross margin of product sales to 81.1% in 2018 compared to 79.0% in 2017 is due to the transition of our fulfillment services from utilizing third party providers in 2017 to managing the process internally in 2018 as well as improvements in the cost of products negotiated with our manufacturers during the period. Additionally, the increase in our print and direct mail marketing spend during fiscal 2018 resulted in customers purchasing more units per order when compared to the typical purchases that occur on e-commerce platforms which results in a decrease in shipping expense per unit on average.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by financing activities was approximately $6.3 million, consisting primarily of the net proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $2.9 million and notes payable and short-term loans payable of $5.8 million, offset by the repayment of notes payable and short-term loans payable of approximately $2.3 million. Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 was approximately $3.2 million, consisting primarily of the net proceeds from the public equity offering of $3.3 million and notes payable of $1.7 million, offset by the repayment of convertible debentures of approximately $1.2 million, notes payable and short-term loans payable of $0.5 million, and the prepayment penalty on the repayment of the convertible debentures of $0.1 million.\nWe currently market and sell over 35 products in the U.S. and more than 10 in multiple countries around the world through our 12 international commercial partners. We have five core products which we define as having more than $1.0 million in annual sales or rapidly growing product. The following represents these core products:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates\nIn addition, we currently expect to launch in the U.S. the following products in 2019, subject to the applicable regulatory approvals, if required:\nHistorically, we have funded losses from operations through the sale of equity and issuance of debt instruments. Combined with revenue, these funds have provided us with the capital to operate our business, to sell and support our products, attract and retain key personnel, and add new products to our portfolio. To date, we have experienced net losses each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $43.9 million and a working capital deficit of $2.3 million.\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Stock Based Compensation. All stock-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, warrants, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and restricted stock, are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based upon their estimated fair values. We use Black-Scholes to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards. The estimated fair value is determined at the date of grant. FASB ASC 718 requires that stock-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest. As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 as of January 1, 2017, we have made an entity-wide accounting policy election to account for forfeitures when they occur. There is no cumulative-effect adjustment as a result of the adoption of this ASU as our estimated forfeiture rate prior to adoption of this ASU was 0%.\nOperating Activities\nIn connection with the October 2018 5% Notes Payable, the Company issued the investor restricted shares of common stock totaling 15,239 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the October 2018 5% Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $176,000. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Note.\nOn January 3, 2019, the Company completed a sale of common stock and warrants under a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of 431,490 units ( Units\u201d) for $7.35 per unit, with each Unit consisting of (i) one share of common stock ( Shares\u201d), (ii) one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.35 per share ( Series A Warrant\u201d), and (iii) one warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.40 per share ( Series B Warrant\u201d) (the Private Placement\u201d); provided, however, that in order to ensure that the Investor's beneficial ownership did not exceed 9.99% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the Investor elected to exercise its right to purchase 200,637 prefunded warrants ( Series C Warrants,\u201d and together with the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, the Investor Warrants\u201d) in lieu of Shares as part of the Units, which Series C Warrants have a nominal exercise price of $0.105 per share. In addition, the Company issued Series B Warrants to purchase 32,362 shares of common stock, an amount equal to 7.5% of the aggregate number of Shares, including Series C Warrants, sold in the Private Placement, at an exercise price of $9.19 per share (the Placement Agent Warrants\u201d) to the designees of H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (the Placement Agent\u201d), the Company's sole placement agent, as compensation for its services in connection with the Private Placement.\n</table>\nWe are continuously introducing our products to varieties of retail and wholesale partners to enhance the brand and product awareness for our customers. In 2018, we significantly increased our advertising expenses specifically in the Print and Direct Mail Marketing channel which, in turn, has had a direct positive impact to the success of products in retail. We intend to continue to demonstrate to our retail and wholesale partners the advantages of incorporating our products in their stores, especially due to our proprietary consumer targeted marketing approach that our print advertising allows us to achieve.\n\nWe have an extensive on-line media channel through our Amazon\u00ae, NewEgg\u00ae, Walmart.com\u00ae, eBay\u00ae, Wish.com, and Walgreens.com sites in addition to our own InnovusPharma.com site along with sites for each of our products individually. Our expertise allows us to successfully drive product sales through proper marketing campaigns through third-party sites as well as through email marketing campaigns to increase traffic to our own sites. Additionally, we have recognized that maintaining a proper e-commerce presence allows those customers who read our advertisements in the newspapers and magazine or receive our direct mail another avenue to purchase products.\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td>\nSeptember 2018 5% Notes Payable\nOur corporate strategy focuses on two primary objectives:\nPrivate Placement\nJanuary and March 2018 Notes Payable\n\nWest-Ward Pharmaceuticals Commercial Agreement\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was approximately $6.1 million compared with cash used in operating activities of approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in the cash used by operating activities of approximately $3.7 million is due primarily from an increase in the net loss of $1.8 million, a net reduction in working capital of $2.4 million and a reduction in stock compensation expenses issued to employees, the board of directors and consultants of $0.6 million offset by increases of $1.2 million consisting primarily from additional loss on the extinguishment of debt and the amortization of debt discount both relating to our issued notes payable.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nInvesting Activities\nOn October 8, 2018, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement with one of the February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable holders. In connection with the securities exchange agreement, the Company issued a total of 40,481 shares of common stock in exchange for the settlement of principal due totaling $340,000. The fair value of the shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of the securities exchange agreements was determined to be $485,000. Due to the settlement of the principal balance of $340,000 into shares of common stock, the transaction was recorded as a debt extinguishment and the fair value of the shares of common stock issued in excess of the settled principal balance totaling $145,000 and the unamortized debt discount as of the date of settlement of $3,000 were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n</td> </tr>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nResearch and Development\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve the use of more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and any changes in the assumptions used in making the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nJuly 2018 5% Note Payable\nWe recognized interest expense of approximately $1.4 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest expense primarily includes interest related to our debt, amortization of debt discounts and the fair value of the embedded conversion feature derivative liability in excess of the proceeds allocated to the debt in 2017 (see Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report). Due to the shares, warrants and cash discounts provided to our lenders, the effective interest rate is significantly higher than the coupon rate. The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 is due to the increase in the note agreements entered into during the year to enable us to increase the sales and marketing throughout the period.\nWe recognized net revenue of approximately $24.0 million and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in net revenue in 2018 was primarily the result of new product launches in late 2017 and 2018 as well as an increase in marketing spend through the sales and marketing platform acquired in the Beyond Human\u00ae asset acquisition in March 2016. Diabasens\u00ae was launched in the first quarter of 2018, and we recognized net sales of approximately $5.5 million during the fiscal year and established a subscription base of approximately $108,000 monthly as of December 31, 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2016 we launched UriVarx\u00ae and during 2017 we launched ProstaGorx\u00ae, Apeaz\u00ae and ArthriVarx\u00ae, three of the four of which were core products in fiscal 2018 and collectively recognized net sales of approximately $9.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $4.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and established a subscription base of approximately $137,000 monthly as of December 31, 2018. Two of our historical products, Vesele\u00ae and Sensum+\u00ae, also recognized continued growth in the year ended December 31, 2018, generating net revenue of $5.4 million compared with $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn connection with the February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable, we issued the investors restricted shares of our common stock totaling 14,143 shares. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable. The allocation of the proceeds received to the restricted shares of common stock based on their relative fair value and the OID resulted in us recording a debt discount of $94,000 in February 2018 and $129,000 in March 2018. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the February and March 2018 5% Notes Payable.\nWe have raised funds through the issuance of debt and the sale of common stock. We have also issued equity instruments in certain circumstances to pay for services from vendors and consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately $2.9 million in funds from the exercise of warrants and an aggregate of $5.8 million from the issuance of notes payable and short-term loans payable. These funds were primarily utilized for working capital purposes. The outstanding notes payable and short-term loans payable principal balance at December 31, 2018 was approximately $3.3 million.\nGeneral and Administrative\nEquity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Services\nThe SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management's view, important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and demanding of management's judgment. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.\nWe recognized a provision for income taxes of $0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe provide a customer satisfaction warranty on all of our products to customers for a specified amount of time after product delivery. Estimated return costs are based on historical experience and estimated and recorded when the related sales are recognized. Any additional costs are recorded when incurred or when they can reasonably be estimated.\nWe reviewed all contracts at the date of initial application and elected to use the modified retrospective transition method, where the cumulative effect of the initial application is recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018. Therefore, comparative prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, ( ASC 605\u201d). The adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance was immaterial to our condensed consolidated statements of operations, balance sheet, and cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCertain of our embedded conversion features on debt and issued and outstanding common stock purchase warrants, which have exercise price reset features and other anti-dilution protection clauses, were treated as derivatives for accounting purposes. The common stock purchase warrants were not issued with the intent of effectively hedging any future cash flow, fair value of any asset, liability or any net investment in a foreign operation. The warrants do not qualify for hedge accounting, and as such, all future changes in the fair value of these warrants were recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised, expire or the related rights have been waived. These common stock purchase warrants do not trade in an active securities market, and as such, we estimate the fair value of these warrants using a Probability Weighted Black-Scholes Model and the embedded conversion features using a Path-Dependent Monte Carlo Simulation Model.\nNovember and December 2018 Notes Payable\n\nOn March 15, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved to amend and restate the Company's Charter to affect a one-for-105 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, but not the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our Charter (the Reverse Split\u201d). The Annual Report, financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Additionally, any change in the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date, including changes from events after the acquisition date, such as changes in our estimate of relevant revenue or other targets, will be recognized in earnings in the period of the estimated fair value change.
