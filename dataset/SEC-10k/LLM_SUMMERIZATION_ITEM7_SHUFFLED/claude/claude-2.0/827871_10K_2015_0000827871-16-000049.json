Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d For information on risks and uncertainties related to our business that may make past performance not indicative of future\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nresults, or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing injectable products utilizing the FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Our business model is to develop proprietary innovations to FDA-approved, injectable drugs that offer longer commercial duration at attractive prices. For each of our products, we intend to enter the market no later than the first generic drug, allowing us to substantially convert the market to our product by addressing the needs of stakeholders who ultimately use our products. We believe we can further extend commercial duration through new intellectual property protection and/or orphan drug exclusivity and three years of regulatory exclusivity as provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act, as applicable.\nOur product portfolio now includes five approved products: EP-1101 (argatroban) ( EP-1101\u201d), Ryanodex\u00ae (dantrolene sodium) ( Ryanodex\u201d), docetaxel injection, non-alcohol formulation ( Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection\u201d), diclofenac-misoprostol, and EP-3102 (rapidly infused bendamustine RTD) ( EP-3102 Bendeka\u201d). We have three commercial partners: Teva, who markets EP-3102 Bendeka and The Medicines Company ( MDCO\u201d) and Sandoz Inc. ( Sandoz\u201d), who pursuant to separate agreements market EP-1101. Our recently approved EP-3102 Bendeka was commercially launched by Teva in January 2016.\nWe intend to market and commercialize our products through our recent co-promotion agreement with Spectrum while continuing to grow our commercial organization.\nWe currently have four product candidates in advanced stages of development, and/or under review for approval by the FDA. Additionally, we have other exploratory candidates under a collaborative agreement entered into in January 2016 with Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (\"AMRI\"). Our four advanced candidates are EP-6101 Kangio\u2122 ready-to-use (\"RTU\") bivalirudin, currently under review for approval by the FDA, EP-4104 (dantrolene sodium) ( EP-4104\u201d) for exertional heat stroke (\"EHS\"), and EP-5101 (pemetrexed) ( EP-5101\u201d). Our leading near-term product candidate is Kangio\u2122, a patented liquid intravenous form of Angiomax for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. EP-3101 is tentatively approved and we may begin commercializing in May 2016. Both EP-5101 and the potential label expansion of Ryanodex into EHS may address unmet medical needs in major specialty markets.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 18, 2014 we closed our initial public offering whereby we sold 3,350,000 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and expenses. On March 18, 2014 the underwriters exercised an over-allotment option granted in connection with the offering of 100,000 shares of common stock at the initial public offering price, less the underwriter discount. The aggregate net proceeds received from the offering were approximately $46.1 million.\nOn March 14, 2014 we received FDA approval of our Abbreviated New Drug Application for diclofenac-misoprostol tablets. In May 2014, we submitted additional data to the FDA with respect to manufacturing procedures of the product and final approval was achieved in June 2014.\nOn July 2, 2014, we were granted tentative approval for EP-3101 (bendamustine RTD) ( EP-3101 RTD\u201d). Due to orphan drug exclusivity held by Cephalon, the tentative approval received in July 2014 may not convert to final approval until May 2016, unless, we are able to demonstrate at an earlier date that our bendamustine product, which has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA, is clinically superior to Cephalon's currently-marketed formulation. We believe that bendamustine represents a domestic market opportunity of over $700 million. The EP-3101 RTD NDA was filed with the FDA on September 6, 2013.\nOn July 22, 2014 we received FDA approval for Ryanodex for injectable suspension indicated for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia (\"MH\"), for which an NDA was filed with the FDA on January 17, 2014. We launched in August 2014 and incurred expenses associated with marketing and other launch efforts.\nOn August 8, 2014, we settled the lawsuit with Hikma related to the APA (See Note 10 Asset Sales\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the settlement we will retain ownership of diclofenac-misoprostol including the rights to launch and commercialize the product and we will pay to Hikma a percentage of Net Profits after recovery of certain expenses.\nOn August 29, 2014, we successfully executed the product launch of Ryanodex. We contracted a third party logistics partner who stores our inventory, fulfills sales orders and provides detailed real time reporting. Additionally, we contracted with a third party sales force comprised of 20 representatives who are focusing their promotional activities on important stakeholders within the hospital setting. To compliment these efforts, we have also engaged group purchasing organizations and wholesalers in contracting discussions.\nIn November 2014 we received positive results from the clinical trial with EP-3102 Bendeka, in which the dose was delivered in a 50mL admixture in ten minutes versus a 500mL admixture in the 60-minute infusion required for Treanda\u00ae (bendamustine HCl). In this study, EP-3102 Bendeka was found to be bioequivalent to Treanda\u00ae, which was the primary endpoint of the study. The incidence and profile of adverse events, both infusion-related and general, for EP-3102 Bendeka was comparable to Treanda\u00ae. This is particularly important because EP-3102 Bendeka delivers the same amount of active ingredient as Treanda\u00ae but with a lower admixture volume, which enables our product to be administered more quickly.\nOn January 20, 2015, our board of directors authorized a change in our fiscal year end from September 30, 2014 to December 31, 2014. The change was intended to better align our fiscal year with the business cycles of other specialty pharmaceutical companies. As a result of the change in fiscal year, our 2015 fiscal year began on January 1, 2015 and ended on December 31, 2015.\nOn February 13, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for EP-3102 Bendeka which was approved by the FDA on December 8, 2015. Also, on February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon License with Cephalon, Inc. for U.S. and Canadian rights to EP-3102 Bendeka for treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL. Pursuant to the terms of the Cephalon License, Cephalon is responsible for all U.S. commercial activities for the product including promotion and distribution, and we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals and conducting post-approval clinical studies. Additionally, under the terms of the Cephalon License, we received an upfront cash payment of $30 million, received a $15 million milestone in January 2016, related to the FDA approval of EP-3102 Bendeka in December 2015 and are currently eligible to receive up to $65 million in additional milestone payments. In addition, we are entitled to receive royalty payments of 20% of net sales of the product. In connection with the Cephalon License, we have entered into a supply agreement with Cephalon, pursuant to which we will be responsible for supplying product to Cephalon for a specified period.\nIn connection with the Cephalon License, on February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon Settlement Agreement with Cephalon, pursuant to which the parties agreed to settle the pending patent infringement claims against each other regarding Cephalon's US Patent No. 8,791,270, under which we agreed to enter into a Consent Judgment regarding the \u2018270 patent. As part of the Cephalon Settlement Agreement, Cephalon has agreed to waive its orphan drug exclusivities for the treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL with EP-3102 Bendeka.\nOn March 20, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering (the \"Follow-on Offering\") of 1,518,317 shares of common stock, including the exercise by the underwriters of a 30-day option to purchase an additional 198,041 shares of common stock. Of the shares sold, 1,388,517 shares were issued and offered by the Company and 129,800 shares were offered by certain selling stockholders. All of the shares were offered at a price to the public of $42.00 per share. The net proceeds from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $54.3 million. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling stockholders. The securities described above were offered by us pursuant to a shelf registration statement declared effective by the SEC on March 13, 2015.\nOn April 7, 2015 and May 19, 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO\u201d) granted us Patents No. 9,000,021 and No. 9,034,908 for our rapid infusion bendamustine, for treating patients requiring restricted fluid and/or sodium intake. These patents extend to March 2033.\nOn May 20, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for our ready-to-use Bivalirudin product which was accepted for filing by the FDA. The FDA action date for this NDA is March 19, 2016.\nOn September 29, 2015, the USPTO granted us Patent No. 9,144,568, which pertains to the use of EP-3102 Bendeka. The patent extends to March 2033.\nOn October 13, 2015, we entered into the Teikoku Agreement, whereby Teikoku granted to us a royalty-bearing, exclusive right and license under and to Teikoku's patent rights and know how to make, use, market, commercialize, and offer for sale Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection described in NDA 205934. Pursuant to the agreement, and after the FDA's approval of NDA 205934 which happened on December 22, 2015, Teikoku also assigned NDA 205934 to us. In consideration for the license and assignment, we made an upfront payment to Teikoku upon signing and an additional milestone payment of $4.85 million upon Teikoku's submission of the NDA transfer letter to the FDA in February 2016. In addition, commencing with the first commercial sale of the product, we will pay to Teikoku a royalty based on the gross margin generated by the product. The royalty owed to Teikoku will be reduced by a double-digit percentage for any sales in a period during which the product is not covered by a valid claim within the Teikoku patent rights.\nOn November 4, 2015, we entered into the Spectrum Agreement under which the Spectrum 32-person Corporate Accounts Sales Team will dedicate 80% of its time to selling and marketing up to six of the Company's products over a period of at least 18 months. The Company will pay Spectrum a base fee of $12.8 million over 18 months, and additional payments of up to $9 million if\nspecified targets for annual net sales of our products are met during the initial term of the Spectrum Agreement, for a potential total payment of up to $22 million during the initial term. We may extend the initial term of this agreement by six months to December 31, 2017 at our sole election. Any extensions after December 31, 2017 require mutual consent and will be for six months per extension.\nAs part of the Spectrum Agreement and long-term strategy to build an internal commercial team, we will also hire approximately 20 direct sales representatives that will be a part of our independent commercial organization. These representatives will be managed under the Spectrum sales team infrastructure for the duration of the Spectrum Agreement.\nOn January 11, 2016, we entered into an agreement with AMRI to jointly develop and manufacture several select and complex parenteral drug products for registration and subsequent commercialization in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, AMRI will develop and initially provide cGMP manufacturing and analytical support for the registration of the new product candidates. We will be responsible for advancing the product candidates through clinical trials and regulatory submissions.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nRevenue includes product sales, royalty income and license and other income. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nWe recognize revenues from product sales of Ryanodex, EP-1101 and diclofenac-misoprostol. Ryanodex and diclofenac-misoprostol, launched in January 2015, are sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers through a third party logistics partner and EP-1101 is sold directly to our commercial partners. Sales to our commercial partners are typically made at little or no profit for resale. We expect that our 2016 product sales will also include EP-3102 Bendeka and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, both launched in January 2016.\nRoyalty Income. We recognize revenue from royalties based on our commercial partners' net sales of EP-1101, typically calculated as a percentage of the net selling price, which is net of discounts, returns and allowances incurred by our commercial partners. Royalty income is recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms when it can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. We expect that our 2016 royalty income to include royalties on sales of EP-3102 Bendeka from Teva.\nLicense and other income. We recognize license revenue from Teva related to Bendeka. Other income resulted from FDA approval of diclofenac-misoprostol related to the asset sale agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals.\nOur revenues may either be in the form of the recognition of deferred revenues upon milestone achievement for which cash has already been received or recognition of revenue upon milestone achievement, the payment for which is reasonably assured to be received in the future.\nCurrently, our product sales are from EP-1101, Ryanodex and diclofenac-misoprostol, and royalty income is derived from the sale of EP-1101to, and the resale by, two commercial partners, Sandoz and MDCO. The primary factors that determine our revenues derived from EP-1101 are:\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the level of orders submitted by our commercial partners, Sandoz and MDCO;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the level of orders submitted by our commercial partners, Sandoz and The Medicines Company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the level of institutional demand for EP-1101;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unit sales prices; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount of gross-to-net sales adjustments realized by our marketing partners.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The primary factors that may determine our revenues derived from Ryanodex\u00ae and our future products are:\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the effectiveness of our contracted sales force and co-promotion partner, Spectrum;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the level of orders submitted by wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the level of institutional demand for our products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unit sales prices; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount of gross-to-net sales and chargebacks.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Chargebacks. We typically enter into agreements with group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their hospital members, in connection with the hospitals' purchases of products. Based on these agreements, most of our hospital customers have the right\nto receive a discounted price for products and volume-based rebates on product purchases. In the case of discounted pricing, we typically receive a chargeback, representing the difference between the contract acquisition list price and the discounted price.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of the costs associated with producing our products for our commercial partners. In particular, our cost of revenue includes production costs of our products paid to a contract manufacturing organization coupled with shipping and customs charges, as well as royalty expense. Cost of revenue may also include the effects of product recalls, if applicable.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in developing, testing, manufacturing and seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates, including: expenses associated with regulatory submissions, clinical trials and manufacturing, including additional expenses in preparing for the commercial manufacture of products including Ryanodex (launched in August 2014), EP-4104, EP-5101, and Kangio\u2122 and EP-3102 Bendeka and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection (both launched in early 2016); payments made to third-party clinical research organizations, contract laboratories and independent contractors; payments made to consultants who perform research and development on our behalf and assist us in the preparation of regulatory filings; payments made to third-party investigators who perform research and development on our behalf and clinical sites where such research and development is conducted; expenses incurred to maintain technology licenses; and facility, maintenance, allocated rent, utilities, depreciation and amortization and other related expenses. Additionally, costs include salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for research and development personnel.\nClinical trial expenses for our product candidates are and will be a significant component of our research and development expenses. Product candidates in later stage clinical development generally have higher research and development expenses than those in earlier stages of development. We coordinate clinical trials through a number of contracted investigational sites and recognize the associated expense based on a number of factors, including actual and estimated subject enrollment and visits, direct pass-through costs and other clinical site fees.\nWe expect to incur additional research and development expenses as we accelerate the development of our product portfolio, both internally and through our joint development agreement with AMRI, as applicable. These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties regarding timing and cost to completion. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for executive, finance, selling and operations personnel. Included in selling costs are expenses related to our contracted sales organization and marketing related to the product launch of Ryanodex\u00ae in August 2014, and most recently Docetaxel injection in early 2016. General and administrative expenses include facility and related costs, professional fees for legal, consulting, tax and accounting services, insurance, selling, market research, advisory board and key opinion leaders, depreciation and general corporate expenses.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase with the potential further commercialization of our product candidates particularly as we begin to commercialize our products through our co-promotion agreement with Spectrum and continue to grow our commercial organization.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income, interest expense and changes in value of our warrant liability. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash interest costs related to our issuance of convertible notes, including the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of our New Jersey state net operating losses which is net of any minimum state taxes paid.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2014\nRevenues\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty income\n</td> <td>8,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,449\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and other income\n</td> <td>45,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased $47.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $66.2 million as compared to $19.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2014.\nProduct sales increased approximately $8.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $13.0 million as compared to $4.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2014. This increase was due to $2.2 million in net product sales of diclofenac-misoprostol (launched in January 2015), an increase of $5.9 million in net product sales of Ryanodex (launched in August 2014), and an increase in EP-1101 product sales of $0.2 million.\nRoyalty income decreased $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $8.3 million as compared to $10.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 as a result of return adjustments passed through to Eagle by one of our commercial partners.\nLicense and other income increased $41.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $45.0 million as compared to $3.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2014, as a result of the licensing agreement with Cephalon. Other income in the year ended September 30, 2014 resulted from FDA approval of diclofenac-misoprostol related to the asset sale agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue increased $3.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $15.6 million as compared to $11.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2014, as a result of increased product sales, an increase in royalty expense and inventory write-offs. The cost of revenue increase related to product sales was due to $1.2 million in cost of revenue for diclofenac-misoprostol (launched in January 2015), and a $2.3 million increase in cost of revenue for Ryanodex (launched in August 2014), offset by a $0.6 million decrease in cost of revenue for EP-1101 resulting from additional product testing incurred in the prior period. In addition, SciDose royalty expense increased $2.2 million due to the licensing agreement with Cephalon and cost of revenue further increased due to $1.1 million of inventory write-offs attributable to expiring Ryanodex inventory. These increases were further offset by a $2.3 million decrease in EP-1101 royalty expense due the returns adjustment passed through to Eagle from our commercial partner.\nResearch and Development\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-6101 Kangio\u2122 (bivalirudin)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-3101 (bendamustine RTD)\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,855\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-3102 (bendamustine rapid infusion)\n</td> <td>6,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ryanodex\u00ae (dantrolene sodium) EHS\n</td> <td>2,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-5101 (pemetrexed)\n</td> <td>4,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diclofenac-misoprostol\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(961\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other projects\n</td> <td>2,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salary and other personnel related expenses\n</td> <td>6,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased approximately $11.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $27.9 million as compared to $16.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2014.\nResearch and development expenses incurred in the year ended December 31, 2015 were higher than in the year ended September 30, 2014 mainly as a result of increased project spending for EP-5101 related to registration batches, technical transfer and manufacturing services, for EP-3102 Bendeka related to pre-launch inventory write-offs and certain professional expenses, and for Kangio\u2122 related to FDA filling fees, legal costs and development costs to support product approval. In addition, there was increased spending for the successful completion of the clinical treatment portion of the safety and efficacy study of Ryanodex for EHS. Salary and other personnel-related expenses increased due to increased staffing and higher overall compensation costs.

Royalty related to EP-1101 increased by $4.1 million due to an increase in royalty expense to both SciDose and MDCO. Under the terms of our revenue sharing arrangement with SciDose, we retain all revenue from the sale of a product commercialized under a 505(b)(2) application until we have recouped our expenses related to the development of that product. Once our expenses are recouped, we are required to split the net proceeds from royalty income received equally with SciDose. Expenses related to the development of EP-1101 were recouped during the quarter ended September 30, 2013. As a result, we recognized an increase of $3.4 million in royalty expense in the year ended September 30, 2014 that was not recognized in the year ended September 30, 2013. Additionally, as a result of the Hikma settlement we incurred $0.3 million related to a one-time royalty due to diclofenac-misoprostol expenses. Royalty expense related to Ryanodex, launched in August 2014, was approximately $35 thousand.\nWith respect to EP-1101 product sales we experienced a net decrease in the cost of revenue of approximately $(0.2) million in the year ended September 30, 2014 over the year ended September 30, 2013. This net decrease is comprised of a $0.6 million increase in testing costs offset by an $(0.9) million decrease in product costs. The volume of product shipped in year ended September 30, 2014, excluding the product recall was approximately 18% less than product shipped in the year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease also correlates to the decrease in product revenue. We experienced a product recall in the October through December 2012 period and experienced fewer shipments in the April through September 2014 period due to longer lead times in procuring materials for manufacturing. Cost of revenue related to Ryanodex was approximately $0.2 million, of which $20 thousand was related to product sales and $0.1 million for other expenses incurred including predominantly certain regulatory and other expenses to our third party logistics partner.\nWe would expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of product sales and royalty income to remain consistent with the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2014.\nResearch and Development\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-6101 (bivalirudin)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-3102 (bendamustine rapid infusion)\n</td> <td>4,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ryanodex\u00ae (dantrolene for MH)\n</td> <td>1,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(208\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-3101 (bendamustine RTD)\n</td> <td>2,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>diclofenac-misoprostol\n</td> <td>978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>978\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-4104 (dantrolene for EHS)\n</td> <td>199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other projects\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,905\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salary and other personnel related expenses\n</td> <td>3,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased $7.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $16.8 million as compared to $9.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2013.\nResearch and development expenses incurred in the year ended September 30, 2014 were higher than in the year ended September 30, 2013 as a result of increased project spending for EP-6101 (bivalirudin) related to registration batches, and technical transfer and manufacturing services, EP-3102 Bendeka related to spending on the PK (pharmacokinetic) study related to support of product approval and certain legal and professional expenses. Spending increase on diclofenac-misoprostol was related to legal costs and development costs to support product approval.

The fiscal 2013 other income and expense primarily includes interest expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount related to the convertible notes that were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the recognition of the change in value of the warrant liability and the settlement related to the MDCO arbitration.\nState Income Tax Benefit\nIn the years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 we realized proceeds from the sale of our New Jersey state net operating losses of $1.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 was $(18.0) million and $(6.0) million, respectively, as a result of the factors described above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn February 18, 2014, we closed our initial public offering whereby 3,350,000 shares of common stock were sold, at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and expenses. On March 18, 2014, the underwriters exercised an over-allotment option granted in connection with the offering of 100,000 shares of common stock at the initial public offering price, less the underwriter discount. The aggregate net proceeds received from the offering were approximately $46.1 million.\nOn March 20, 2015, we completed the Follow-on Offering described above under the heading \"Recent Developments\". As previously indicated, the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $54.3 million.\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund working capital requirements, product development costs and operating expenses. Historically, we have funded our operations primarily through public offerings of common stock and private placements of preferred stock and convertible notes and out-licensing product rights. Cash and cash equivalents were $79.1 million, $34.9 million and $22.7 million as of December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2014, respectively. In addition, short term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills were $20.0 million at September 30, 2014.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized net income of $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital surplus of $88.0 million. For the year ended September 30, 2014, we incurred a net loss of $18.0 million. We have sustained significant losses since our inception on January 2, 2007 and had accumulated a deficit of $107.1 million as of December 31, 2015.\nWe believe that future cash flows from operations, together with proceeds from the initial and follow-on public offering will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital requirements through mid-year 2017. No assurance can be given that operating results will improve, out-licensing of products will be successful or that additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us.\nOperating Activities:\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $9.7 million. Net income for the period was $2.6 million adjusted by non-cash adjustments of approximately $4.4 million from depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, retirement of fixed assets and lessor contributions for leasehold improvements. Net changes in working capital decreased cash from operating activities by approximately $16.7 million, due to an increase in accounts receivable of $14.3 million, an increase in inventories of $13.8 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.2 million, an increase in other assets of $0.1 million, an increase in accounts payable of $0.4 million and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $11.9 million. We experienced a decrease in deferred revenue of $0.5 million. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued royalties, accrued cost of revenue, accrued inventory purchases, and accrued research and development. Inventories increased significantly in preparation for the launch of EP-3102 Bendeka in January 2016. Accounts receivable increased primarily due to the $15.0 million milestone royalty earned under the Cephalon License agreement. The total amount of accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 was approximately $26.3 million, which included approximately $2.0 million of product sales and approximately $24.2 million of royalty income, all with payment terms of 45 days and approximately $0.1 million of other receivables. For royalty income, the 45-day period starts at the end of the quarter upon receipt of the royalty statement detailing the amount of sales in the prior completed quarter, and, for product sales, the period starts upon delivery of product.\nAt December 31, 2015, our cumulative receivables related to royalty income consist of approximately $9.2 million in receivables from MDCO and $15.0 million from Cephalon.\nBased on our agreement with MDCO, our cumulative receivables related to that agreement will continue to aggregate in future periods. Our agreement with MDCO does not contemplate the ability for the parties to net settle amounts receivable or payable. Notwithstanding this, we have periodically collected from MDCO amounts that would be equal to the net amount of receivables due from MDCO, but, because it is unclear whether such cash receipt is intended to be settlement of the net receivable or only a partial payment towards the gross receivable, we have presented these receivables and payables in gross amounts on its\nfinancial statements. As a result, the cumulative receivable from MDCO, as reduced by the cash received from MDCO, aggregates from period-to-period and has never been fully offset by those actual cash payments. At December 31, 2015, we recorded a receivable of approximately $9.2 million and a payable of $7.0 million to MDCO (based upon a 50% revenue split on Sandoz sales). The net receivable due from MDCO as of December 31, 2015 therefore is $2.2 million. The receivable of $2.2 million from MDCO as of December 31, 2015 therefore represents our net cumulative receivable.\nWe believe that our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015, after taking into account netting of receivables and payables related to MDCO, are reasonably collectible, and given the payment terms, will be collected in approximately 90 days, and thus would not have a material effect on our liquidity.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2014 was $(7.9) million. Net loss for the period was $(5.5) million offset by non-cash adjustments of approximately $0.3 million from depreciation and stock-based compensation expense. Net changes in working capital decreased cash from operating activities by approximately $(2.7) million, due to a decrease in inventories of $0.1 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.1 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $(0.6) million, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $(0.1) million. We experienced an increase in accounts receivable of $(4.7) million and an increase in accrued expenses of $2.5 million. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued royalties. The total amount of accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 was approximately $12.0 million, which included approximately $1.8 million of product sales and approximately $10.1 million of royalty income, all with payment terms of 45 days and approximately $0.1 million of other receivables. For royalty income, the 45-day period starts at the end of the quarter upon receipt of the royalty statement detailing the amount of sales in the prior completed quarter, and, for product sales, the period starts upon delivery of product.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2014 was $(13.8) million. Net loss for the period was $(18.0) million offset by non-cash adjustments of approximately $1.3 million from the change in the value of the warrant liability, depreciation and stock-based compensation expense. Net changes in working capital increased cash from operating activities by approximately $2.9 million, due to a decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.2 million related to prepaid insurance, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $(3.4) million. We experienced an increase in accounts receivable of $(2.2) million, an increase of $(1.3) million in inventory and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $9.6 million. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued royalties. The total amount of accounts receivable at September 30, 2014 was approximately $7.3 million, which included approximately $0.7 million of product sales and approximately $6.2 million of royalty income, all with payment terms of 45 days, and approximately $0.4 million of other receivables. For royalty income, the 45-day period starts at the end of the quarter upon receipt of the royalty statement detailing the amount of sales in the prior completed quarter, and, for product sales, the period starts upon delivery of product.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2013 was $(5.9) million and resulted primarily from $(6.0) million of net loss for the period. Non-cash adjustments amounted to $3.0 million in depreciation, amortization, interest, stock-based compensation expense and the change in value of warrant liability. Net changes in working capital decreased cash from operating activities by approximately $(2.8) million, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $(3.5) million from the higher product revenues of EP-1101, an increase in prepaid expenses of $(1.4) million ($0.7 million for prepaid product costs and $0.8 million for FDA user fees, offset by decreases of $0.1 million in other prepaid expenses) and a decrease in accounts payable of $(0.3) million offset by an increase of $1.7 million in accrued expenses ($2.2 million in royalties due to MDCO and SciDose offset by $0.5 million of reductions in other accrued expenses) and an increase in deferred revenue of $0.5 million.\nInvesting Activities:\nIn fiscal 2015, the transition period, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, we invested $1,881, $11, $46 and $41 thousand, respectively, for the purchase of property and equipment.\nIn fiscal 2015, the transition period, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we invested $106.0 million, $0, $20.0 million and $0, respectively, in U.S. Treasury securities, and we redeemed $106.0 million, $20.0 million, $0 and $1.5 million, respectively, of short- term investments.\nFinancing Activities:\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $55.8 million primarily resulting from the issuance of Common Stock from the follow-on offering and proceeds from stock options exercised of $1.5 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2014 was $34 thousand resulting from proceeds of stock options exercised.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2014 was $46.2 million primarily resulting from the issuance of Common Stock from the initial public offering and the exercise of warrants of $21 thousand and proceeds from stock options exercised of $65 thousand.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2013 was $9.8 million resulting from the issuance of Series C Preferred Stock.\nContractual Obligations\nOur future material contractual obligations include the following (in thousands):\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.\nIn July 2015, the FASB finalized a one year delay in the effective date of this standard, which will now be effective for us on January 1, 2018, however early adoption is permitted any time after the original effective date, which for us is January 1, 2017. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which revises the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes and require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. The guidance is to be applied either prospectively or retrospectively, and is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2016 for public companies. Early adoption is permitted. The implementation of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which revises the guidance in ASC 825-10, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, and provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. The guidance is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.\nThe new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.\nWe are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our financial statements.\nNo accounting standards or interpretations issued recently are expected to have a material impact on our financial position, operation or cash flow.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nImpact of Inflation\nWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In addition, our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard.\nWe regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate\u201d where:\n\u2022the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and\n\u2022the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to our financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Not all of these significant accounting policies, however, require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates.\u201d We have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition, accounting for fair value of warrant liabilities and share-based compensation described below are critical accounting estimates.\u201d\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses, such as commissions and royalties. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Royalty revenues, based on net sales by licensees, are recorded as revenue for the period in which those sales are made by the licensees. License fees are recorded over the life of the license. Deferred revenue is recognized upon the achievement of milestones. Other deferred revenue is amortized over the life of the underlying agreement.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.\nProduct sales. We recognize net revenues from products manufactured and supplied to our commercial partners, when the following four basic revenue recognition criteria under the related accounting guidance are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Prior to the shipment of our manufactured products, we conduct initial product release and stability testing in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. Our commercial partners can return the products within contracted specified timeframes if the products do not meet the applicable inspection tests. We estimate our return reserves based on our experience with historical return rates. Historically, our product returns have not been material.\nRoyalty income. We recognize revenue from royalties based on our commercial partners' net sales of products. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms when they can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. Our commercial partners are obligated to report their net product sales and the resulting royalty due to us within 60 days from the end of each quarter. Based on historical product sales, royalty receipts and other relevant information, we accrue royalty revenue each quarter and subsequently true-up when we receive royalty reports from our commercial partners.\nCollaborative arrangements. We recognize revenue from reimbursements received in connection with feasibility studies and development work for third parties when our contractual services are performed, provided collectability is reasonably assured. Our principal costs under these arrangements include our personnel conducting research and development, and our allocated overhead, as well as research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants.\nWe recognize revenues from non-refundable up-front license fees received under collaboration arrangements ratably over the performance period as determined under the collaboration agreement (estimated development period in the case of development arrangements, and contract period or longest patent life in the case of supply and distribution arrangements). If the estimated performance period is subsequently modified, we will modify the period over which the up-front license fee is recognized accordingly on a prospective basis. Upon termination of a collaboration agreement, any remaining non-refundable license fees received by us, which had been deferred, are generally recognized in full. All such recognized revenues are included in collaborative licensing and development revenue in our statements of operations. We recognize revenue from milestone payments received\nunder collaboration arrangements when earned, provided that the milestone event is substantive, its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement, we have no further performance obligations relating to the event and collectability is reasonably assured. If these criteria are not met, we recognize milestone payments ratably over the remaining period of our performance obligations under the collaboration agreement.\nStock-based compensation. We account for stock-based compensation under ASC, 718 \"Accounting for Stock Based Compensation.\" All stock-based awards granted to non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with ASC 718, and ASC 505, \" Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services,\" under which compensation expense is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of fair values of stock options as of the grant date.\nWe account for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all stock-based payments made to employees and directors based on estimated grant date fair values. We use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, or Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the calculation of expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. The risk-free interest rate was determined with the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options.", "item_7_truncated": "Comparison of Years Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing injectable products utilizing the FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.

Net changes in working capital decreased cash from operating activities by approximately $(2.8) million, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $(3.5) million from the higher product revenues of EP-1101, an increase in prepaid expenses of $(1.4) million ($0.7 million for prepaid product costs and $0.8 million for FDA user fees, offset by decreases of $0.1 million in other prepaid expenses) and a decrease in accounts payable of $(0.3) million offset by an increase of $1.7 million in accrued expenses ($2.2 million in royalties due to MDCO and SciDose offset by $0.5 million of reductions in other accrued expenses) and an increase in deferred revenue of $0.5 million.\nWe would expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of product sales and royalty income to remain consistent with the year ended\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund working capital requirements, product development costs and operating expenses.

Cost of revenue related to Ryanodex was approximately $0.2 million, of which $20 thousand was related to product sales and $0.1 million for other expenses incurred including predominantly certain regulatory and other expenses to our third party logistics partner.\n \u2022 the effectiveness of our contracted sales force and co-promotion partner, Spectrum; \n\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-6101 KangioTM (bivalirudin)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-3101 (bendamustine RTD)\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,855\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-3102 (bendamustine rapid infusion)\n</td> <td>6,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ryanodex\u00ae (dantrolene sodium) EHS\n</td> <td>2,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EP-5101 (pemetrexed)\n</td> <td>4,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diclofenac-misoprostol\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(961\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other projects\n</td> <td>2,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salary and other personnel related expenses\n</td> <td>6,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $3 thousand based upon its estimated federal AMT and state tax liability.\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(135\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 unit sales prices; and \nand other expenses to our third party logistics partner.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d For information on risks and uncertainties related to our business that may make past performance not indicative of future\nOn February 18, 2014, we closed our initial public offering whereby 3,350,000 shares of common stock were sold, at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and expenses. On March 18, 2014, the underwriters exercised an over-allotment option granted in connection with the offering of 100,000 shares of common stock at the initial public offering price, less the underwriter discount. The aggregate net proceeds received from the offering were approximately $46.1 million.\nspecified targets for annual net sales of our products are met during the initial term of the Spectrum Agreement, for a potential total payment of up to $22 million during the initial term. We may extend the initial term of this agreement by six months to December 31, 2017 at our sole election. Any extensions after December 31, 2017 require mutual consent and will be for six months per extension.\nAs part of the Spectrum Agreement and long-term strategy to build an internal commercial team, we will also hire approximately 20 direct sales representatives that will be a part of our independent commercial organization. These representatives will be managed under the Spectrum sales team infrastructure for the duration of the Spectrum Agreement.\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalty income increased $0.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $4.1 million as compared to $3.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013, as a result of increased end use sales of EP-1101 by our commercial partners.\nResearch and Development\nThe net increase in total revenue was offset by a decrease in product sales of $(0.7) million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $4.6 million as compared to $5.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2013. This net decrease in product sales was due to longer lead times in procuring materials for manufacturing EP-1101, partially offset by the August 2014 launch of Ryanodex which resulted in net product sales of $0.2 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe expect to incur additional research and development expenses as we accelerate the development of our product portfolio, both internally and through our joint development agreement with AMRI, as applicable. These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties regarding timing and cost to completion. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in developing, testing, manufacturing and seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates, including: expenses associated with regulatory submissions, clinical trials and manufacturing, including additional expenses in preparing for the commercial manufacture of products including Ryanodex (launched in August 2014), EP-4104, EP-5101, and KangioTM and EP-3102 Bendeka and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection (both launched in early 2016); payments made to third-party clinical research organizations, contract laboratories and independent contractors; payments made to consultants who perform research and development on our behalf and assist us in the preparation of regulatory filings; payments made to third-party investigators who perform research and development on our behalf and clinical sites where such research and development is conducted; expenses incurred to maintain technology licenses; and facility, maintenance, allocated rent, utilities, depreciation and amortization and other related expenses. Additionally, costs include salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for research and development personnel.\nOther Income and Expense\nCurrently, our product sales are from EP-1101, Ryanodex and diclofenac-misoprostol, and royalty income is derived from the sale of EP-1101to, and the resale by, two commercial partners, Sandoz and MDCO. The primary factors that determine our revenues derived from EP-1101 are:\n\nOther Income (Expense)\nResults of Operations\nCollaborative arrangements. We recognize revenue from reimbursements received in connection with feasibility studies and development work for third parties when our contractual services are performed, provided collectability is reasonably assured. Our principal costs under these arrangements include our personnel conducting research and development, and our allocated overhead, as well as research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThis increase is related to a $2.4 million increase in marketing related to the August 2014 launch of Ryanodex. As a result of our public offering in February 2014 and operating as a publicly traded company, overall compensation related expense increased by $1.4 million and we experienced an increase of $0.5 million of insurance and professional fees. We experienced a $0.1 million net increase in various other expenses without material concentrations.\nCost of Revenue\nOur future material contractual obligations include the following (in thousands):\nRoyalty income increased $2.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $10.7 million as compared to $8.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2013 as a result of increased end use sales of EP-1101 by our commercial partners earlier in the period offset by decreased end-use sales of argatroban that may be related to market competition.\nfinancial statements. As a result, the cumulative receivable from MDCO, as reduced by the cash received from MDCO, aggregates from period-to-period and has never been fully offset by those actual cash payments. At December 31, 2015, we recorded a receivable of approximately $9.2 million and a payable of $7.0 million to MDCO (based upon a 50% revenue split on Sandoz sales). The net receivable due from MDCO as of December 31, 2015 therefore is $2.2 million. The receivable of $2.2 million from MDCO as of December 31, 2015 therefore represents our net cumulative receivable.\n\nRoyalty income decreased $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $8.3 million as compared to $10.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 as a result of return adjustments passed through to Eagle by one of our commercial partners.\nto receive a discounted price for products and volume-based rebates on product purchases. In the case of discounted pricing, we typically receive a chargeback, representing the difference between the contract acquisition list price and the discounted price.\nOther income and (expense) increased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to income of $14 thousand as compared to an expense of $0.5 million for year ended September 31, 2014. The fiscal 2014 amount consists primarily of the recognition of the change in value of the warrant liability.\nOn March 20, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering (the \"Follow-on Offering\") of 1,518,317 shares of common stock, including the exercise by the underwriters of a 30-day option to purchase an additional 198,041 shares of common stock. Of the shares sold, 1,388,517 shares were issued and offered by the Company and 129,800 shares were offered by certain selling stockholders. All of the shares were offered at a price to the public of $42.00 per share. The net proceeds from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $54.3 million. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling stockholders. The securities described above were offered by us pursuant to a shelf registration statement declared effective by the SEC on March 13, 2015.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nCost of revenue increased $3.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $15.6 million as compared to $11.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2014, as a result of increased product sales, an increase in royalty expense and inventory write-offs. The cost of revenue increase related to product sales was due to $1.2 million in cost of revenue for diclofenac-misoprostol (launched in January 2015), and a $2.3 million increase in cost of revenue for Ryanodex (launched in August 2014), offset by a $0.6 million decrease in cost of revenue for EP-1101 resulting from additional product testing incurred in the prior period. In addition, SciDose royalty expense increased $2.2 million due to the licensing agreement with Cephalon and cost of revenue further increased due to $1.1 million of inventory write-offs attributable to expiring Ryanodex inventory. These increases were further offset by a $2.3 million decrease in EP-1101 royalty expense due the returns adjustment passed through to Eagle from our commercial partner.\nRoyalty income. We recognize revenue from royalties based on our commercial partners' net sales of products. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms when they can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. Our commercial partners are obligated to report their net product sales and the resulting royalty due to us within 60 days from the end of each quarter. Based on historical product sales, royalty receipts and other relevant information, we accrue royalty revenue each quarter and subsequently true-up when we receive royalty reports from our commercial partners.\nIn fiscal 2015, the transition period, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we invested $106.0 million, $0, $20.0 million and $0, respectively, in U.S. Treasury securities, and we redeemed $106.0 million, $20.0 million, $0 and $1.5 million, respectively, of short- term investments.\nOther Income and Expense\nNet Income\nContractual Obligations\nIn the year ended September 30, 2014 we realized proceeds from the sale of our New Jersey state net operating losses of $1.3 million.\n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by our commercial partners, Sandoz and MDCO; \n\nSeptember 30, 2014.\nOn March 20, 2015, we completed the Follow-on Offering described above under the heading \"Recent Developments\". As previously indicated, the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $54.3 million.\n\nState Income Tax Benefit\n\nProduct sales decreased $(0.7) million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $1.5 million as compared to $2.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013. This net decrease in product sales was due to longer lead times in procuring materials for manufacturing EP-1101, partially offset by Ryanodex, launched in August 2014, which resulted in net product sales of $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014.\nWe believe that our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015, after taking into account netting of receivables and payables related to MDCO, are reasonably collectible, and given the payment terms, will be collected in approximately 90 days, and thus would not have a material effect on our liquidity.\nRecent Developments\nThis increase is related to a $4.8 million increase in selling, general and administrative salary and personnel related expenses, $2.3 million of professional fees, a $2.2 million increase in marketing mainly related to Ryanodex, $0.4 million increase in office expenses, $0.3 million increase in facilities expenses, $0.3 million increase in dues and subscriptions, and a $0.5 million increase in miscellaneous expenses.\nOn July 2, 2014, we were granted tentative approval for EP-3101 (bendamustine RTD) ( EP-3101 RTD\u201d). Due to orphan drug exclusivity held by Cephalon, the tentative approval received in July 2014 may not convert to final approval until May 2016, unless, we are able to demonstrate at an earlier date that our bendamustine product, which has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA, is clinically superior to Cephalon's currently-marketed formulation. We believe that bendamustine represents a domestic market opportunity of over $700 million. The EP-3101 RTD NDA was filed with the FDA on September 6, 2013.\n\n\n\nOn February 13, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for EP-3102 Bendeka which was approved by the FDA on December 8, 2015. Also, on February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon License with Cephalon, Inc. for U.S. and Canadian rights to EP-3102 Bendeka for treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL. Pursuant to the terms of the Cephalon License, Cephalon is responsible for all U.S. commercial activities for the product including promotion and distribution, and we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals and conducting post-approval clinical studies. Additionally, under the terms of the Cephalon License, we received an upfront cash payment of $30 million, received a $15 million milestone in January 2016, related to the FDA approval of EP-3102 Bendeka in December 2015 and are currently eligible to receive up to $65 million in additional milestone payments. In addition, we are entitled to receive royalty payments of 20% of net sales of the product. In connection with the Cephalon License, we have entered into a supply agreement with Cephalon, pursuant to which we will be responsible for supplying product to Cephalon for a specified period.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In addition, our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard.\nIn fiscal 2015, the transition period, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, we invested $1,881, $11, $46 and $41 thousand, respectively, for the purchase of property and equipment.\nCost of revenue consists of the costs associated with producing our products for our commercial partners. In particular, our cost of revenue includes production costs of our products paid to a contract manufacturing organization coupled with shipping and customs charges, as well as royalty expense. Cost of revenue may also include the effects of product recalls, if applicable.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income, interest expense and changes in value of our warrant liability. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash interest costs related to our issuance of convertible notes, including the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs.\nRevenues\nBased on our agreement with MDCO, our cumulative receivables related to that agreement will continue to aggregate in future periods. Our agreement with MDCO does not contemplate the ability for the parties to net settle amounts receivable or payable. Notwithstanding this, we have periodically collected from MDCO amounts that would be equal to the net amount of receivables due from MDCO, but, because it is unclear whether such cash receipt is intended to be settlement of the net receivable or only a partial payment towards the gross receivable, we have presented these receivables and payables in gross amounts on its\nFinancing Activities:\nInvesting Activities:\nOn August 29, 2014, we successfully executed the product launch of Ryanodex. We contracted a third party logistics partner who stores our inventory, fulfills sales orders and provides detailed real time reporting. Additionally, we contracted with a third party sales force comprised of 20 representatives who are focusing their promotional activities on important stakeholders within the hospital setting. To compliment these efforts, we have also engaged group purchasing organizations and wholesalers in contracting discussions.\n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers; \n \u2022 the amount of gross-to-net sales and chargebacks.  Chargebacks. We typically enter into agreements with group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their hospital members, in connection with the hospitals' purchases of products. Based on these agreements, most of our hospital customers have the right\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.6 million as compared to a net loss of $18.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2014, as a result of the factors discussed above.\nResearch and Development\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized net income of $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital surplus of $88.0 million. For the year ended September 30, 2014, we incurred a net loss of $18.0 million. We have sustained significant losses since our inception on January 2, 2007 and had accumulated a deficit of $107.1 million as of December 31, 2015.\nOn July 22, 2014 we received FDA approval for Ryanodex for injectable suspension indicated for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia (\"MH\"), for which an NDA was filed with the FDA on January 17, 2014. We launched in August 2014 and incurred expenses associated with marketing and other launch efforts.\nOur revenues may either be in the form of the recognition of deferred revenues upon milestone achievement for which cash has already been received or recognition of revenue upon milestone achievement, the payment for which is reasonably assured to be received in the future.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.\nResearch and Development\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2014 was $34 thousand resulting from proceeds of stock options exercised.\n \u2022 the level of institutional demand for EP-1101; \nWith respect to EP-1101 product sales we experienced a net decrease in the cost of revenue of approximately $(0.8) million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 over the three months ended December 31, 2013. This net decrease is comprised of a $(0.6) million decrease in testing costs and a $(0.8) million decrease in product costs offset by a $0.7 million increase in royalty expense. Cost of revenue related to Ryanodex\u00ae was approximately $0.7 million, of which $0.1 million was for royalty expense, $0.4 million was related to product sales and $0.2 million for other expenses incurred including predominantly certain regulatory\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.\nResearch and development expenses incurred in the year ended September 30, 2014 were higher than in the year ended September 30, 2013 as a result of increased project spending for EP-6101 (bivalirudin) related to registration batches, and technical transfer and manufacturing services, EP-3102 Bendeka related to spending on the PK (pharmacokinetic) study related to support of product approval and certain legal and professional expenses. Spending increase on diclofenac-misoprostol was related to legal costs and development costs to support product approval. These increases were offset by a reduction in spending on other projects that have been delayed or will no longer be pursued. Salary and other personnel related expenses increased due to increased staffing and higher overall compensation costs.\nOther Income and Expense\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues from non-refundable up-front license fees received under collaboration arrangements ratably over the performance period as determined under the collaboration agreement (estimated development period in the case of development arrangements, and contract period or longest patent life in the case of supply and distribution arrangements). If the estimated performance period is subsequently modified, we will modify the period over which the up-front license fee is recognized accordingly on a prospective basis. Upon termination of a collaboration agreement, any remaining non-refundable license fees received by us, which had been deferred, are generally recognized in full. All such recognized revenues are included in collaborative licensing and development revenue in our statements of operations. We recognize revenue from milestone payments received\nTotal revenue increased $0.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $5.6 million as compared to $5.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013.\nIn November 2014 we received positive results from the clinical trial with EP-3102 Bendeka, in which the dose was delivered in a 50mL admixture in ten minutes versus a 500mL admixture in the 60-minute infusion required for Treanda\u00ae (bendamustine HCl). In this study, EP-3102 Bendeka was found to be bioequivalent to Treanda\u00ae, which was the primary endpoint of the study. The incidence and profile of adverse events, both infusion-related and general, for EP-3102 Bendeka was comparable to Treanda\u00ae. This is particularly important because EP-3102 Bendeka delivers the same amount of active ingredient as Treanda\u00ae but with a lower admixture volume, which enables our product to be administered more quickly.\nProduct sales increased approximately $8.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $13.0 million as compared to $4.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2014. This increase was due to $2.2 million in net product sales of diclofenac-misoprostol (launched in January 2015), an increase of $5.9 million in net product sales of Ryanodex (launched in August 2014), and an increase in EP-1101 product sales of $0.2 million.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which revises the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes and require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. The guidance is to be applied either prospectively or retrospectively, and is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2016 for public companies. Early adoption is permitted. The implementation of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $10.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $20.1 million as compared to $9.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2014.\nOn April 7, 2015 and May 19, 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO\u201d) granted us Patents No. 9,000,021 and No. 9,034,908 for our rapid infusion bendamustine, for treating patients requiring restricted fluid and/or sodium intake. These patents extend to March 2033.\nRevenue\nOn February 18, 2014 we closed our initial public offering whereby we sold 3,350,000 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and expenses. On March 18, 2014 the underwriters exercised an over-allotment option granted in connection with the offering of 100,000 shares of common stock at the initial public offering price, less the underwriter discount. The aggregate net proceeds received from the offering were approximately $46.1 million.\nIncome tax benefit primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of our New Jersey state net operating losses which is net of any minimum state taxes paid.\nNet Loss\nSelling, General and Administrative\nCost of net revenues decreased $(0.1) million to $4.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 from $4.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013. This $(0.1) million net decrease in cost of revenues was mainly attributable to a decrease in product sales of EP-1101 offset by an increase in royalty expense to both SciDose and MDCO. We recognized $2.7 million and $2.0 million in royalty expense for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nImpact of Inflation\nRevenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses, such as commissions and royalties. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Royalty revenues, based on net sales by licensees, are recorded as revenue for the period in which those sales are made by the licensees. License fees are recorded over the life of the license. Deferred revenue is recognized upon the achievement of milestones. Other deferred revenue is amortized over the life of the underlying agreement.\nOther income and (expense) decreased to $(0.5) million for the year ended September 30, 2014 from income of $1.5 million for year ended September 30, 2013. The fiscal 2014 amount consists primarily of the recognition of the change in value of the warrant liability. The fiscal 2013 other income and expense primarily includes interest expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount related to the convertible notes that were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the recognition of the change in value of the warrant liability and the settlement related to the MDCO arbitration.\nNet loss for years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 was $(18.0) million and $(6.0) million, respectively, as a result of the factors described above.\nRevenues\nSelling, general and administrative costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for executive, finance, selling and operations personnel. Included in selling costs are expenses related to our contracted sales organization and marketing related to the product launch of Ryanodex\u00ae in August 2014, and most recently Docetaxel injection in early 2016. General and administrative expenses include facility and related costs, professional fees for legal, consulting, tax and accounting services, insurance, selling, market research, advisory board and key opinion leaders, depreciation and general corporate expenses.\n\nState Income Tax Benefit\nResearch and development expenses increased $7.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $16.8 million as compared to $9.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2013.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2014\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe recognize revenues from product sales of Ryanodex, EP-1101 and diclofenac-misoprostol. Ryanodex and diclofenac-misoprostol, launched in January 2015, are sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers through a third party logistics partner and EP-1101 is sold directly to our commercial partners. Sales to our commercial partners are typically made at little or no profit for resale. We expect that our 2016 product sales will also include EP-3102 Bendeka and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, both launched in January 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $55.8 million primarily resulting from the issuance of Common Stock from the follow-on offering and proceeds from stock options exercised of $1.5 million.\nNo accounting standards or interpretations issued recently are expected to have a material impact on our financial position, operation or cash flow.\nLicense and other income. We recognize license revenue from Teva related to Bendeka. Other income resulted from FDA approval of diclofenac-misoprostol related to the asset sale agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals.\nClinical trial expenses for our product candidates are and will be a significant component of our research and development expenses. Product candidates in later stage clinical development generally have higher research and development expenses than those in earlier stages of development. We coordinate clinical trials through a number of contracted investigational sites and recognize the associated expense based on a number of factors, including actual and estimated subject enrollment and visits, direct pass-through costs and other clinical site fees.\nWe intend to market and commercialize our products through our recent co-promotion agreement with Spectrum while continuing to grow our commercial organization.\nThe new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.\n \u2022 the level of institutional demand for our products; \nWe regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate\u201d where:\nSelling, General and Administrative\nResearch and development expenses increased $1.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $4.0 million as compared to $2.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013. Expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2014 were higher than in the three months ended December 31, 2013 as a result of an increase in project spending for EP-3101, EP-3102 Bendeka, EP-6101, and salaries and other personnel-related expenses, offset by a decrease in project spending for Ryanodex.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $4.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $9.3 million as compared to $5.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2013.\nAt December 31, 2015, our cumulative receivables related to royalty income consist of approximately $9.2 million in receivables from MDCO and $15.0 million from Cephalon.\n \u2022 the amount of gross-to-net sales adjustments realized by our marketing partners.  The primary factors that may determine our revenues derived from Ryanodex\u00ae and our future products are:\n\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $9.7 million. Net income for the period was $2.6 million adjusted by non-cash adjustments of approximately $4.4 million from depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, retirement of fixed assets and lessor contributions for leasehold improvements. Net changes in working capital decreased cash from operating activities by approximately $16.7 million, due to an increase in accounts receivable of $14.3 million, an increase in inventories of $13.8 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.2 million, an increase in other assets of $0.1 million, an increase in accounts payable of $0.4 million and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $11.9 million. We experienced a decrease in deferred revenue of $0.5 million. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued royalties, accrued cost of revenue, accrued inventory purchases, and accrued research and development. Inventories increased significantly in preparation for the launch of EP-3102 Bendeka in January 2016. Accounts receivable increased primarily due to the $15.0 million milestone royalty earned under the Cephalon License agreement. The total amount of accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 was approximately $26.3 million, which included approximately $2.0 million of product sales and approximately $24.2 million of royalty income, all with payment terms of 45 days and approximately $0.1 million of other receivables. For royalty income, the 45-day period starts at the end of the quarter upon receipt of the royalty statement detailing the amount of sales in the prior completed quarter, and, for product sales, the period starts upon delivery of product.\nIncome tax benefit increased $1.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to a benefit of $1.1 million as compared to a benefit of $0.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013 due to the timing of sales of our New Jersey State net operating losses.\nCost of revenue increased $4.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $11.7 million as compared to $7.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2013 mainly as a result of the increase in royalty expense associated with EP-1101 and our commercial marketing partners. Royalty related to EP-1101 increased by $4.1 million due to an increase in royalty expense to both SciDose and MDCO. Under the terms of our revenue sharing arrangement with SciDose, we retain all revenue from the sale of a product commercialized under a 505(b)(2) application until we have recouped our expenses related to the development of that product. Once our expenses are recouped, we are required to split the net proceeds from royalty income received equally with SciDose. Expenses related to the development of EP-1101 were recouped during the quarter ended September 30, 2013. As a result, we recognized an increase of $3.4 million in royalty expense in the year ended September 30, 2014 that was not recognized in the year ended September 30, 2013. Additionally, as a result of the Hikma settlement we incurred $0.3 million related to a one-time royalty due to diclofenac-misoprostol expenses. Royalty expense related to Ryanodex, launched in August 2014, was approximately $35 thousand.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2014 was $(7.9) million. Net loss for the period was $(5.5) million offset by non-cash adjustments of approximately $0.3 million from depreciation and stock-based compensation expense. Net changes in working capital decreased cash from operating activities by approximately $(2.7) million, due to a decrease in inventories of $0.1 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.1 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $(0.6) million, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $(0.1) million. We experienced an increase in accounts receivable of $(4.7) million and an increase in accrued expenses of $2.5 million. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued royalties. The total amount of accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 was approximately $12.0 million, which included approximately $1.8 million of product sales and approximately $10.1 million of royalty income, all with payment terms of 45 days and approximately $0.1 million of other receivables. For royalty income, the 45-day period starts at the end of the quarter upon receipt of the royalty statement detailing the amount of sales in the prior completed quarter, and, for product sales, the period starts upon delivery of product.\nCost of Revenue\n\u2022the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nComparison of Three Months Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nWe are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOther income increased by $3.8 million primarily as a result of the FDA approval of diclofenac-misoprostol related to the asset sale agreement with Hikma Pharmaceutical for $3.5 million. Additionally, we recognized a final milestone of $0.3 million. There were no revenues from collaborative arrangements in the periods presented.\nIn July 2015, the FASB finalized a one year delay in the effective date of this standard, which will now be effective for us on January 1, 2018, however early adoption is permitted any time after the original effective date, which for us is January 1, 2017. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our financial statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2013 was $9.8 million resulting from the issuance of Series C Preferred Stock.\nOperating Activities:\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase with the potential further commercialization of our product candidates particularly as we begin to commercialize our products through our co-promotion agreement with Spectrum and continue to grow our commercial organization.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nWe believe that future cash flows from operations, together with proceeds from the initial and follow-on public offering will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital requirements through mid-year 2017. No assurance can be given that operating results will improve, out-licensing of products will be successful or that additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us.\nOn August 8, 2014, we settled the lawsuit with Hikma related to the APA (See Note 10 Asset Sales\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the settlement we will retain ownership of diclofenac-misoprostol including the rights to launch and commercialize the product and we will pay to Hikma a percentage of Net Profits after recovery of certain expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2014 was $(5.5) million as compared to net loss of $(3.3) million in the three months ended December 31, 2013, as a result of the factors discussed above.\nOverview\nCost of Revenue\nNet Loss\nOn January 11, 2016, we entered into an agreement with AMRI to jointly develop and manufacture several select and complex parenteral drug products for registration and subsequent commercialization in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, AMRI will develop and initially provide cGMP manufacturing and analytical support for the registration of the new product candidates. We will be responsible for advancing the product candidates through clinical trials and regulatory submissions.\nunder collaboration arrangements when earned, provided that the milestone event is substantive, its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement, we have no further performance obligations relating to the event and collectability is reasonably assured. If these criteria are not met, we recognize milestone payments ratably over the remaining period of our performance obligations under the collaboration agreement.\nOn September 29, 2015, the USPTO granted us Patent No. 9,144,568, which pertains to the use of EP-3102 Bendeka. The patent extends to March 2033.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal revenue increased $47.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $66.2 million as compared to $19.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2014.\nIn the years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 we realized proceeds from the sale of our New Jersey state net operating losses of $1.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.\nWe currently have four product candidates in advanced stages of development, and/or under review for approval by the FDA. Additionally, we have other exploratory candidates under a collaborative agreement entered into in January 2016 with Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (\"AMRI\"). Our four advanced candidates are EP-6101 KangioTM ready-to-use (\"RTU\") bivalirudin, currently under review for approval by the FDA, EP-4104 (dantrolene sodium) ( EP-4104\u201d) for exertional heat stroke (\"EHS\"), and EP-5101 (pemetrexed) ( EP-5101\u201d). Our leading near-term product candidate is KangioTM, a patented liquid intravenous form of Angiomax for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. EP-3101 is tentatively approved and we may begin commercializing in May 2016. Both EP-5101 and the potential label expansion of Ryanodex into EHS may address unmet medical needs in major specialty markets.\nTotal revenue increased $5.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $19.1 million as compared to $13.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2013.\nProduct sales. We recognize net revenues from products manufactured and supplied to our commercial partners, when the following four basic revenue recognition criteria under the related accounting guidance are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Prior to the shipment of our manufactured products, we conduct initial product release and stability testing in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. Our commercial partners can return the products within contracted specified timeframes if the products do not meet the applicable inspection tests. We estimate our return reserves based on our experience with historical return rates. Historically, our product returns have not been material.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which revises the guidance in ASC 825-10, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, and provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. The guidance is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on our financial position and results of operations.\n \u2022 unit sales prices; and \nWe account for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all stock-based payments made to employees and directors based on estimated grant date fair values. We use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, or Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the calculation of expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. The risk-free interest rate was determined with the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options.\nResearch and development expenses incurred in the year ended December 31, 2015 were higher than in the year ended September 30, 2014 mainly as a result of increased project spending for EP-5101 related to registration batches, technical transfer and manufacturing services, for EP-3102 Bendeka related to pre-launch inventory write-offs and certain professional expenses, and for KangioTM related to FDA filling fees, legal costs and development costs to support product approval. In addition, there was increased spending for the successful completion of the clinical treatment portion of the safety and efficacy study of Ryanodex for EHS. Salary and other personnel-related expenses increased due to increased staffing and higher overall compensation costs. These increases were offset by a reduction in project spending for EP-3101RTD due to the timing of research and development activities for diclofenac-misoprostol due to product approval.\nOn March 14, 2014 we received FDA approval of our Abbreviated New Drug Application for diclofenac-misoprostol tablets. In May 2014, we submitted additional data to the FDA with respect to manufacturing procedures of the product and final approval was achieved in June 2014.\n\n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by our commercial partners, Sandoz and The Medicines Company; \nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to our financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Not all of these significant accounting policies, however, require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates.\u201d We have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition, accounting for fair value of warrant liabilities and share-based compensation described below are critical accounting estimates.\u201d\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2014 was $(13.8) million. Net loss for the period was $(18.0) million offset by non-cash adjustments of approximately $1.3 million from the change in the value of the warrant liability, depreciation and stock-based compensation expense. Net changes in working capital increased cash from operating activities by approximately $2.9 million, due to a decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.2 million related to prepaid insurance, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $(3.4) million. We experienced an increase in accounts receivable of $(2.2) million, an increase of $(1.3) million in inventory and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $9.6 million. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued royalties. The total amount of accounts receivable at September 30, 2014 was approximately $7.3 million, which included approximately $0.7 million of product sales and approximately $6.2 million of royalty income, all with payment terms of 45 days, and approximately $0.4 million of other receivables. For royalty income, the 45-day period starts at the end of the quarter upon receipt of the royalty statement detailing the amount of sales in the prior completed quarter, and, for product sales, the period starts upon delivery of product.\nresults, or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nIncome Tax Benefit\nRevenues\nOur product portfolio now includes five approved products: EP-1101 (argatroban) ( EP-1101\u201d), Ryanodex\u00ae (dantrolene sodium) ( Ryanodex\u201d), docetaxel injection, non-alcohol formulation ( Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection\u201d), diclofenac-misoprostol, and EP-3102 (rapidly infused bendamustine RTD) ( EP-3102 Bendeka\u201d). We have three commercial partners: Teva, who markets EP-3102 Bendeka and The Medicines Company ( MDCO\u201d) and Sandoz Inc. ( Sandoz\u201d), who pursuant to separate agreements market EP-1101. Our recently approved EP-3102 Bendeka was commercially launched by Teva in January 2016.\n\u2022the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and", "item_7_text": "Comparison of Years Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing injectable products utilizing the FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Our business model is to develop proprietary innovations to FDA-approved, injectable drugs that offer longer commercial duration at attractive prices. For each of our products, we intend to enter the market no later than the first generic drug, allowing us to substantially convert the market to our product by addressing the needs of stakeholders who ultimately use our products. We believe we can further extend commercial duration through new intellectual property protection and/or orphan drug exclusivity and three years of regulatory exclusivity as provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act, as applicable.\nLicense and other income increased $41.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $45.0 million as compared to $3.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2014, as a result of the licensing agreement with Cephalon. Other income in the year ended September 30, 2014 resulted from FDA approval of diclofenac-misoprostol related to the asset sale agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2013 was $(5.9) million and resulted primarily from $(6.0) million of net loss for the period. Non-cash adjustments amounted to $3.0 million in depreciation, amortization, interest, stock-based compensation expense and the change in value of warrant liability. Net changes in working capital decreased cash from operating activities by approximately $(2.8) million, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $(3.5) million from the higher product revenues of EP-1101, an increase in prepaid expenses of $(1.4) million ($0.7 million for prepaid product costs and $0.8 million for FDA user fees, offset by decreases of $0.1 million in other prepaid expenses) and a decrease in accounts payable of $(0.3) million offset by an increase of $1.7 million in accrued expenses ($2.2 million in royalties due to MDCO and SciDose offset by $0.5 million of reductions in other accrued expenses) and an increase in deferred revenue of $0.5 million.\nWe would expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of product sales and royalty income to remain consistent with the year ended\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund working capital requirements, product development costs and operating expenses. Historically, we have funded our operations primarily through public offerings of common stock and private placements of preferred stock and convertible notes and out-licensing product rights. Cash and cash equivalents were $79.1 million, $34.9 million and $22.7 million as of December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2014, respectively. In addition, short term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills were $20.0 million at September 30, 2014.\nOther income and (expense) decreased by $(0.2) million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $0.0 as compared to an expense of $0.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in other income and (expense) was due to the recognition of the change in value of the warrant liability during three months ended December 31, 2013. These convertible notes and warrants converted to common stock in connection with the initial public offering in February 2014.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2014 was $46.2 million primarily resulting from the issuance of Common Stock from the initial public offering and the exercise of warrants of $21 thousand and proceeds from stock options exercised of $65 thousand.\nRevenue includes product sales, royalty income and license and other income. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\n\nOn May 20, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for our ready-to-use Bivalirudin product which was accepted for filing by the FDA. The FDA action date for this NDA is March 19, 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $3.7 million as compared to $1.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013. This increase is related to a $1.5 million increase in marketing related to the launch of Ryanodex, increase of $0.5 million of professional fees, insurance and miscellaneous expenses and $0.4 million increase in general and administrative salary and personnel-related expenses.\nOn November 4, 2015, we entered into the Spectrum Agreement under which the Spectrum 32-person Corporate Accounts Sales Team will dedicate 80% of its time to selling and marketing up to six of the Company's products over a period of at least 18 months. The Company will pay Spectrum a base fee of $12.8 million over 18 months, and additional payments of up to $9 million if\nIn connection with the Cephalon License, on February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon Settlement Agreement with Cephalon, pursuant to which the parties agreed to settle the pending patent infringement claims against each other regarding Cephalon's US Patent No. 8,791,270, under which we agreed to enter into a Consent Judgment regarding the \u2018270 patent. As part of the Cephalon Settlement Agreement, Cephalon has agreed to waive its orphan drug exclusivities for the treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL with EP-3102 Bendeka.\nRoyalty Income. We recognize revenue from royalties based on our commercial partners' net sales of EP-1101, typically calculated as a percentage of the net selling price, which is net of discounts, returns and allowances incurred by our commercial partners. Royalty income is recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms when it can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. We expect that our 2016 royalty income to include royalties on sales of EP-3102 Bendeka from Teva.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nOn January 20, 2015, our board of directors authorized a change in our fiscal year end from September 30, 2014 to December 31, 2014. The change was intended to better align our fiscal year with the business cycles of other specialty pharmaceutical companies. As a result of the change in fiscal year, our 2015 fiscal year began on January 1, 2015 and ended on December 31, 2015.\nResearch and development expenses increased approximately $11.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $27.9 million as compared to $16.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2014.\nStock-based compensation. We account for stock-based compensation under ASC, 718 \"Accounting for Stock Based Compensation.\" All stock-based awards granted to non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with ASC 718, and ASC 505, \" Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services,\" under which compensation expense is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of fair values of stock options as of the grant date.\nOn October 13, 2015, we entered into the Teikoku Agreement, whereby Teikoku granted to us a royalty-bearing, exclusive right and license under and to Teikoku's patent rights and know how to make, use, market, commercialize, and offer for sale Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection described in NDA 205934. Pursuant to the agreement, and after the FDA's approval of NDA 205934 which happened on December 22, 2015, Teikoku also assigned NDA 205934 to us. In consideration for the license and assignment, we made an upfront payment to Teikoku upon signing and an additional milestone payment of $4.85 million upon Teikoku's submission of the NDA transfer letter to the FDA in February 2016. In addition, commencing with the first commercial sale of the product, we will pay to Teikoku a royalty based on the gross margin generated by the product. The royalty owed to Teikoku will be reduced by a double-digit percentage for any sales in a period during which the product is not covered by a valid claim within the Teikoku patent rights.\nWith respect to EP-1101 product sales we experienced a net decrease in the cost of revenue of approximately $(0.2) million in the year ended September 30, 2014 over the year ended September 30, 2013. This net decrease is comprised of a $0.6 million increase in testing costs offset by an $(0.9) million decrease in product costs. The volume of product shipped in year ended September 30, 2014, excluding the product recall was approximately 18% less than product shipped in the year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease also correlates to the decrease in product revenue. We experienced a product recall in the October through December 2012 period and experienced fewer shipments in the April through September 2014 period due to longer lead times in procuring materials for manufacturing. Cost of revenue related to Ryanodex was approximately $0.2 million, of which $20 thousand was related to product sales and $0.1 million for other expenses incurred including predominantly certain regulatory and other expenses to our third party logistics partner.\n \u2022 the effectiveness of our contracted sales force and co-promotion partner, Spectrum; \n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $3 thousand based upon its estimated federal AMT and state tax liability.\n \u2022 unit sales prices; and \nand other expenses to our third party logistics partner.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d For information on risks and uncertainties related to our business that may make past performance not indicative of future\nOn February 18, 2014, we closed our initial public offering whereby 3,350,000 shares of common stock were sold, at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and expenses. On March 18, 2014, the underwriters exercised an over-allotment option granted in connection with the offering of 100,000 shares of common stock at the initial public offering price, less the underwriter discount. The aggregate net proceeds received from the offering were approximately $46.1 million.\nspecified targets for annual net sales of our products are met during the initial term of the Spectrum Agreement, for a potential total payment of up to $22 million during the initial term. We may extend the initial term of this agreement by six months to December 31, 2017 at our sole election. Any extensions after December 31, 2017 require mutual consent and will be for six months per extension.\nAs part of the Spectrum Agreement and long-term strategy to build an internal commercial team, we will also hire approximately 20 direct sales representatives that will be a part of our independent commercial organization. These representatives will be managed under the Spectrum sales team infrastructure for the duration of the Spectrum Agreement.\nRoyalty income increased $0.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $4.1 million as compared to $3.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013, as a result of increased end use sales of EP-1101 by our commercial partners.\nResearch and Development\nThe net increase in total revenue was offset by a decrease in product sales of $(0.7) million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $4.6 million as compared to $5.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2013. This net decrease in product sales was due to longer lead times in procuring materials for manufacturing EP-1101, partially offset by the August 2014 launch of Ryanodex which resulted in net product sales of $0.2 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe expect to incur additional research and development expenses as we accelerate the development of our product portfolio, both internally and through our joint development agreement with AMRI, as applicable. These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties regarding timing and cost to completion. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in developing, testing, manufacturing and seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates, including: expenses associated with regulatory submissions, clinical trials and manufacturing, including additional expenses in preparing for the commercial manufacture of products including Ryanodex (launched in August 2014), EP-4104, EP-5101, and KangioTM and EP-3102 Bendeka and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection (both launched in early 2016); payments made to third-party clinical research organizations, contract laboratories and independent contractors; payments made to consultants who perform research and development on our behalf and assist us in the preparation of regulatory filings; payments made to third-party investigators who perform research and development on our behalf and clinical sites where such research and development is conducted; expenses incurred to maintain technology licenses; and facility, maintenance, allocated rent, utilities, depreciation and amortization and other related expenses. Additionally, costs include salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for research and development personnel.\nOther Income and Expense\nCurrently, our product sales are from EP-1101, Ryanodex and diclofenac-misoprostol, and royalty income is derived from the sale of EP-1101to, and the resale by, two commercial partners, Sandoz and MDCO. The primary factors that determine our revenues derived from EP-1101 are:\n\nOther Income (Expense)\nResults of Operations\nCollaborative arrangements. We recognize revenue from reimbursements received in connection with feasibility studies and development work for third parties when our contractual services are performed, provided collectability is reasonably assured. Our principal costs under these arrangements include our personnel conducting research and development, and our allocated overhead, as well as research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThis increase is related to a $2.4 million increase in marketing related to the August 2014 launch of Ryanodex. As a result of our public offering in February 2014 and operating as a publicly traded company, overall compensation related expense increased by $1.4 million and we experienced an increase of $0.5 million of insurance and professional fees. We experienced a $0.1 million net increase in various other expenses without material concentrations.\nCost of Revenue\nOur future material contractual obligations include the following (in thousands):\nRoyalty income increased $2.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $10.7 million as compared to $8.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2013 as a result of increased end use sales of EP-1101 by our commercial partners earlier in the period offset by decreased end-use sales of argatroban that may be related to market competition.\nfinancial statements. As a result, the cumulative receivable from MDCO, as reduced by the cash received from MDCO, aggregates from period-to-period and has never been fully offset by those actual cash payments. At December 31, 2015, we recorded a receivable of approximately $9.2 million and a payable of $7.0 million to MDCO (based upon a 50% revenue split on Sandoz sales). The net receivable due from MDCO as of December 31, 2015 therefore is $2.2 million. The receivable of $2.2 million from MDCO as of December 31, 2015 therefore represents our net cumulative receivable.\n\nRoyalty income decreased $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $8.3 million as compared to $10.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 as a result of return adjustments passed through to Eagle by one of our commercial partners.\nto receive a discounted price for products and volume-based rebates on product purchases. In the case of discounted pricing, we typically receive a chargeback, representing the difference between the contract acquisition list price and the discounted price.\nOther income and (expense) increased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to income of $14 thousand as compared to an expense of $0.5 million for year ended September 31, 2014. The fiscal 2014 amount consists primarily of the recognition of the change in value of the warrant liability.\nOn March 20, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering (the \"Follow-on Offering\") of 1,518,317 shares of common stock, including the exercise by the underwriters of a 30-day option to purchase an additional 198,041 shares of common stock. Of the shares sold, 1,388,517 shares were issued and offered by the Company and 129,800 shares were offered by certain selling stockholders. All of the shares were offered at a price to the public of $42.00 per share. The net proceeds from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $54.3 million. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling stockholders. The securities described above were offered by us pursuant to a shelf registration statement declared effective by the SEC on March 13, 2015.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nCost of revenue increased $3.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $15.6 million as compared to $11.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2014, as a result of increased product sales, an increase in royalty expense and inventory write-offs. The cost of revenue increase related to product sales was due to $1.2 million in cost of revenue for diclofenac-misoprostol (launched in January 2015), and a $2.3 million increase in cost of revenue for Ryanodex (launched in August 2014), offset by a $0.6 million decrease in cost of revenue for EP-1101 resulting from additional product testing incurred in the prior period. In addition, SciDose royalty expense increased $2.2 million due to the licensing agreement with Cephalon and cost of revenue further increased due to $1.1 million of inventory write-offs attributable to expiring Ryanodex inventory. These increases were further offset by a $2.3 million decrease in EP-1101 royalty expense due the returns adjustment passed through to Eagle from our commercial partner.\nRoyalty income. We recognize revenue from royalties based on our commercial partners' net sales of products. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms when they can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. Our commercial partners are obligated to report their net product sales and the resulting royalty due to us within 60 days from the end of each quarter. Based on historical product sales, royalty receipts and other relevant information, we accrue royalty revenue each quarter and subsequently true-up when we receive royalty reports from our commercial partners.\nIn fiscal 2015, the transition period, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we invested $106.0 million, $0, $20.0 million and $0, respectively, in U.S. Treasury securities, and we redeemed $106.0 million, $20.0 million, $0 and $1.5 million, respectively, of short- term investments.\nOther Income and Expense\nNet Income\nContractual Obligations\nIn the year ended September 30, 2014 we realized proceeds from the sale of our New Jersey state net operating losses of $1.3 million.\n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by our commercial partners, Sandoz and MDCO; \n\nSeptember 30, 2014.\nOn March 20, 2015, we completed the Follow-on Offering described above under the heading \"Recent Developments\". As previously indicated, the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $54.3 million.\n\nState Income Tax Benefit\n\nProduct sales decreased $(0.7) million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $1.5 million as compared to $2.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013. This net decrease in product sales was due to longer lead times in procuring materials for manufacturing EP-1101, partially offset by Ryanodex, launched in August 2014, which resulted in net product sales of $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014.\nWe believe that our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015, after taking into account netting of receivables and payables related to MDCO, are reasonably collectible, and given the payment terms, will be collected in approximately 90 days, and thus would not have a material effect on our liquidity.\nRecent Developments\nThis increase is related to a $4.8 million increase in selling, general and administrative salary and personnel related expenses, $2.3 million of professional fees, a $2.2 million increase in marketing mainly related to Ryanodex, $0.4 million increase in office expenses, $0.3 million increase in facilities expenses, $0.3 million increase in dues and subscriptions, and a $0.5 million increase in miscellaneous expenses.\nOn July 2, 2014, we were granted tentative approval for EP-3101 (bendamustine RTD) ( EP-3101 RTD\u201d). Due to orphan drug exclusivity held by Cephalon, the tentative approval received in July 2014 may not convert to final approval until May 2016, unless, we are able to demonstrate at an earlier date that our bendamustine product, which has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA, is clinically superior to Cephalon's currently-marketed formulation. We believe that bendamustine represents a domestic market opportunity of over $700 million. The EP-3101 RTD NDA was filed with the FDA on September 6, 2013.\n\n\n\nOn February 13, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for EP-3102 Bendeka which was approved by the FDA on December 8, 2015. Also, on February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon License with Cephalon, Inc. for U.S. and Canadian rights to EP-3102 Bendeka for treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL. Pursuant to the terms of the Cephalon License, Cephalon is responsible for all U.S. commercial activities for the product including promotion and distribution, and we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals and conducting post-approval clinical studies. Additionally, under the terms of the Cephalon License, we received an upfront cash payment of $30 million, received a $15 million milestone in January 2016, related to the FDA approval of EP-3102 Bendeka in December 2015 and are currently eligible to receive up to $65 million in additional milestone payments. In addition, we are entitled to receive royalty payments of 20% of net sales of the product. In connection with the Cephalon License, we have entered into a supply agreement with Cephalon, pursuant to which we will be responsible for supplying product to Cephalon for a specified period.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In addition, our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard.\nIn fiscal 2015, the transition period, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, we invested $1,881, $11, $46 and $41 thousand, respectively, for the purchase of property and equipment.\nCost of revenue consists of the costs associated with producing our products for our commercial partners. In particular, our cost of revenue includes production costs of our products paid to a contract manufacturing organization coupled with shipping and customs charges, as well as royalty expense. Cost of revenue may also include the effects of product recalls, if applicable.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income, interest expense and changes in value of our warrant liability. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash interest costs related to our issuance of convertible notes, including the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs.\nRevenues\nBased on our agreement with MDCO, our cumulative receivables related to that agreement will continue to aggregate in future periods. Our agreement with MDCO does not contemplate the ability for the parties to net settle amounts receivable or payable. Notwithstanding this, we have periodically collected from MDCO amounts that would be equal to the net amount of receivables due from MDCO, but, because it is unclear whether such cash receipt is intended to be settlement of the net receivable or only a partial payment towards the gross receivable, we have presented these receivables and payables in gross amounts on its\nFinancing Activities:\nInvesting Activities:\nOn August 29, 2014, we successfully executed the product launch of Ryanodex. We contracted a third party logistics partner who stores our inventory, fulfills sales orders and provides detailed real time reporting. Additionally, we contracted with a third party sales force comprised of 20 representatives who are focusing their promotional activities on important stakeholders within the hospital setting. To compliment these efforts, we have also engaged group purchasing organizations and wholesalers in contracting discussions.\n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers; \n \u2022 the amount of gross-to-net sales and chargebacks.  Chargebacks. We typically enter into agreements with group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their hospital members, in connection with the hospitals' purchases of products. Based on these agreements, most of our hospital customers have the right\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.6 million as compared to a net loss of $18.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2014, as a result of the factors discussed above.\nResearch and Development\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized net income of $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital surplus of $88.0 million. For the year ended September 30, 2014, we incurred a net loss of $18.0 million. We have sustained significant losses since our inception on January 2, 2007 and had accumulated a deficit of $107.1 million as of December 31, 2015.\nOn July 22, 2014 we received FDA approval for Ryanodex for injectable suspension indicated for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia (\"MH\"), for which an NDA was filed with the FDA on January 17, 2014. We launched in August 2014 and incurred expenses associated with marketing and other launch efforts.\nOur revenues may either be in the form of the recognition of deferred revenues upon milestone achievement for which cash has already been received or recognition of revenue upon milestone achievement, the payment for which is reasonably assured to be received in the future.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.\nResearch and Development\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2014 was $34 thousand resulting from proceeds of stock options exercised.\n \u2022 the level of institutional demand for EP-1101; \nWith respect to EP-1101 product sales we experienced a net decrease in the cost of revenue of approximately $(0.8) million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 over the three months ended December 31, 2013. This net decrease is comprised of a $(0.6) million decrease in testing costs and a $(0.8) million decrease in product costs offset by a $0.7 million increase in royalty expense. Cost of revenue related to Ryanodex\u00ae was approximately $0.7 million, of which $0.1 million was for royalty expense, $0.4 million was related to product sales and $0.2 million for other expenses incurred including predominantly certain regulatory\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.\nResearch and development expenses incurred in the year ended September 30, 2014 were higher than in the year ended September 30, 2013 as a result of increased project spending for EP-6101 (bivalirudin) related to registration batches, and technical transfer and manufacturing services, EP-3102 Bendeka related to spending on the PK (pharmacokinetic) study related to support of product approval and certain legal and professional expenses. Spending increase on diclofenac-misoprostol was related to legal costs and development costs to support product approval. These increases were offset by a reduction in spending on other projects that have been delayed or will no longer be pursued. Salary and other personnel related expenses increased due to increased staffing and higher overall compensation costs.\nOther Income and Expense\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues from non-refundable up-front license fees received under collaboration arrangements ratably over the performance period as determined under the collaboration agreement (estimated development period in the case of development arrangements, and contract period or longest patent life in the case of supply and distribution arrangements). If the estimated performance period is subsequently modified, we will modify the period over which the up-front license fee is recognized accordingly on a prospective basis. Upon termination of a collaboration agreement, any remaining non-refundable license fees received by us, which had been deferred, are generally recognized in full. All such recognized revenues are included in collaborative licensing and development revenue in our statements of operations. We recognize revenue from milestone payments received\nTotal revenue increased $0.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $5.6 million as compared to $5.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013.\nIn November 2014 we received positive results from the clinical trial with EP-3102 Bendeka, in which the dose was delivered in a 50mL admixture in ten minutes versus a 500mL admixture in the 60-minute infusion required for Treanda\u00ae (bendamustine HCl). In this study, EP-3102 Bendeka was found to be bioequivalent to Treanda\u00ae, which was the primary endpoint of the study. The incidence and profile of adverse events, both infusion-related and general, for EP-3102 Bendeka was comparable to Treanda\u00ae. This is particularly important because EP-3102 Bendeka delivers the same amount of active ingredient as Treanda\u00ae but with a lower admixture volume, which enables our product to be administered more quickly.\nProduct sales increased approximately $8.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $13.0 million as compared to $4.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2014. This increase was due to $2.2 million in net product sales of diclofenac-misoprostol (launched in January 2015), an increase of $5.9 million in net product sales of Ryanodex (launched in August 2014), and an increase in EP-1101 product sales of $0.2 million.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which revises the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes and require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. The guidance is to be applied either prospectively or retrospectively, and is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2016 for public companies. Early adoption is permitted. The implementation of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $10.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $20.1 million as compared to $9.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2014.\nOn April 7, 2015 and May 19, 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO\u201d) granted us Patents No. 9,000,021 and No. 9,034,908 for our rapid infusion bendamustine, for treating patients requiring restricted fluid and/or sodium intake. These patents extend to March 2033.\nRevenue\nOn February 18, 2014 we closed our initial public offering whereby we sold 3,350,000 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and expenses. On March 18, 2014 the underwriters exercised an over-allotment option granted in connection with the offering of 100,000 shares of common stock at the initial public offering price, less the underwriter discount. The aggregate net proceeds received from the offering were approximately $46.1 million.\nIncome tax benefit primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of our New Jersey state net operating losses which is net of any minimum state taxes paid.\nNet Loss\nSelling, General and Administrative\nCost of net revenues decreased $(0.1) million to $4.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 from $4.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013. This $(0.1) million net decrease in cost of revenues was mainly attributable to a decrease in product sales of EP-1101 offset by an increase in royalty expense to both SciDose and MDCO. We recognized $2.7 million and $2.0 million in royalty expense for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nImpact of Inflation\nRevenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses, such as commissions and royalties. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Royalty revenues, based on net sales by licensees, are recorded as revenue for the period in which those sales are made by the licensees. License fees are recorded over the life of the license. Deferred revenue is recognized upon the achievement of milestones. Other deferred revenue is amortized over the life of the underlying agreement.\nOther income and (expense) decreased to $(0.5) million for the year ended September 30, 2014 from income of $1.5 million for year ended September 30, 2013. The fiscal 2014 amount consists primarily of the recognition of the change in value of the warrant liability. The fiscal 2013 other income and expense primarily includes interest expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount related to the convertible notes that were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the recognition of the change in value of the warrant liability and the settlement related to the MDCO arbitration.\nNet loss for years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 was $(18.0) million and $(6.0) million, respectively, as a result of the factors described above.\nRevenues\nSelling, general and administrative costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for executive, finance, selling and operations personnel. Included in selling costs are expenses related to our contracted sales organization and marketing related to the product launch of Ryanodex\u00ae in August 2014, and most recently Docetaxel injection in early 2016. General and administrative expenses include facility and related costs, professional fees for legal, consulting, tax and accounting services, insurance, selling, market research, advisory board and key opinion leaders, depreciation and general corporate expenses.\n\nState Income Tax Benefit\nResearch and development expenses increased $7.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $16.8 million as compared to $9.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2013.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2014\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe recognize revenues from product sales of Ryanodex, EP-1101 and diclofenac-misoprostol. Ryanodex and diclofenac-misoprostol, launched in January 2015, are sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers through a third party logistics partner and EP-1101 is sold directly to our commercial partners. Sales to our commercial partners are typically made at little or no profit for resale. We expect that our 2016 product sales will also include EP-3102 Bendeka and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, both launched in January 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $55.8 million primarily resulting from the issuance of Common Stock from the follow-on offering and proceeds from stock options exercised of $1.5 million.\nNo accounting standards or interpretations issued recently are expected to have a material impact on our financial position, operation or cash flow.\nLicense and other income. We recognize license revenue from Teva related to Bendeka. Other income resulted from FDA approval of diclofenac-misoprostol related to the asset sale agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals.\nClinical trial expenses for our product candidates are and will be a significant component of our research and development expenses. Product candidates in later stage clinical development generally have higher research and development expenses than those in earlier stages of development. We coordinate clinical trials through a number of contracted investigational sites and recognize the associated expense based on a number of factors, including actual and estimated subject enrollment and visits, direct pass-through costs and other clinical site fees.\nWe intend to market and commercialize our products through our recent co-promotion agreement with Spectrum while continuing to grow our commercial organization.\nThe new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.\n \u2022 the level of institutional demand for our products; \nWe regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate\u201d where:\nSelling, General and Administrative\nResearch and development expenses increased $1.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $4.0 million as compared to $2.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013. Expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2014 were higher than in the three months ended December 31, 2013 as a result of an increase in project spending for EP-3101, EP-3102 Bendeka, EP-6101, and salaries and other personnel-related expenses, offset by a decrease in project spending for Ryanodex.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $4.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $9.3 million as compared to $5.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2013.\nAt December 31, 2015, our cumulative receivables related to royalty income consist of approximately $9.2 million in receivables from MDCO and $15.0 million from Cephalon.\n \u2022 the amount of gross-to-net sales adjustments realized by our marketing partners.  The primary factors that may determine our revenues derived from Ryanodex\u00ae and our future products are:\n\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $9.7 million. Net income for the period was $2.6 million adjusted by non-cash adjustments of approximately $4.4 million from depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, retirement of fixed assets and lessor contributions for leasehold improvements. Net changes in working capital decreased cash from operating activities by approximately $16.7 million, due to an increase in accounts receivable of $14.3 million, an increase in inventories of $13.8 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.2 million, an increase in other assets of $0.1 million, an increase in accounts payable of $0.4 million and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $11.9 million. We experienced a decrease in deferred revenue of $0.5 million. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued royalties, accrued cost of revenue, accrued inventory purchases, and accrued research and development. Inventories increased significantly in preparation for the launch of EP-3102 Bendeka in January 2016. Accounts receivable increased primarily due to the $15.0 million milestone royalty earned under the Cephalon License agreement. The total amount of accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 was approximately $26.3 million, which included approximately $2.0 million of product sales and approximately $24.2 million of royalty income, all with payment terms of 45 days and approximately $0.1 million of other receivables. For royalty income, the 45-day period starts at the end of the quarter upon receipt of the royalty statement detailing the amount of sales in the prior completed quarter, and, for product sales, the period starts upon delivery of product.\nIncome tax benefit increased $1.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2014 to a benefit of $1.1 million as compared to a benefit of $0.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013 due to the timing of sales of our New Jersey State net operating losses.\nCost of revenue increased $4.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $11.7 million as compared to $7.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2013 mainly as a result of the increase in royalty expense associated with EP-1101 and our commercial marketing partners. Royalty related to EP-1101 increased by $4.1 million due to an increase in royalty expense to both SciDose and MDCO. Under the terms of our revenue sharing arrangement with SciDose, we retain all revenue from the sale of a product commercialized under a 505(b)(2) application until we have recouped our expenses related to the development of that product. Once our expenses are recouped, we are required to split the net proceeds from royalty income received equally with SciDose. Expenses related to the development of EP-1101 were recouped during the quarter ended September 30, 2013. As a result, we recognized an increase of $3.4 million in royalty expense in the year ended September 30, 2014 that was not recognized in the year ended September 30, 2013. Additionally, as a result of the Hikma settlement we incurred $0.3 million related to a one-time royalty due to diclofenac-misoprostol expenses. Royalty expense related to Ryanodex, launched in August 2014, was approximately $35 thousand.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2014 was $(7.9) million. Net loss for the period was $(5.5) million offset by non-cash adjustments of approximately $0.3 million from depreciation and stock-based compensation expense. Net changes in working capital decreased cash from operating activities by approximately $(2.7) million, due to a decrease in inventories of $0.1 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.1 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $(0.6) million, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $(0.1) million. We experienced an increase in accounts receivable of $(4.7) million and an increase in accrued expenses of $2.5 million. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued royalties. The total amount of accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 was approximately $12.0 million, which included approximately $1.8 million of product sales and approximately $10.1 million of royalty income, all with payment terms of 45 days and approximately $0.1 million of other receivables. For royalty income, the 45-day period starts at the end of the quarter upon receipt of the royalty statement detailing the amount of sales in the prior completed quarter, and, for product sales, the period starts upon delivery of product.\nCost of Revenue\n\u2022the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nComparison of Three Months Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nWe are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOther income increased by $3.8 million primarily as a result of the FDA approval of diclofenac-misoprostol related to the asset sale agreement with Hikma Pharmaceutical for $3.5 million. Additionally, we recognized a final milestone of $0.3 million. There were no revenues from collaborative arrangements in the periods presented.\nIn July 2015, the FASB finalized a one year delay in the effective date of this standard, which will now be effective for us on January 1, 2018, however early adoption is permitted any time after the original effective date, which for us is January 1, 2017. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our financial statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2013 was $9.8 million resulting from the issuance of Series C Preferred Stock.\nOperating Activities:\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase with the potential further commercialization of our product candidates particularly as we begin to commercialize our products through our co-promotion agreement with Spectrum and continue to grow our commercial organization.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nWe believe that future cash flows from operations, together with proceeds from the initial and follow-on public offering will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital requirements through mid-year 2017. No assurance can be given that operating results will improve, out-licensing of products will be successful or that additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us.\nOn August 8, 2014, we settled the lawsuit with Hikma related to the APA (See Note 10 Asset Sales\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the settlement we will retain ownership of diclofenac-misoprostol including the rights to launch and commercialize the product and we will pay to Hikma a percentage of Net Profits after recovery of certain expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2014 was $(5.5) million as compared to net loss of $(3.3) million in the three months ended December 31, 2013, as a result of the factors discussed above.\nOverview\nCost of Revenue\nNet Loss\nOn January 11, 2016, we entered into an agreement with AMRI to jointly develop and manufacture several select and complex parenteral drug products for registration and subsequent commercialization in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, AMRI will develop and initially provide cGMP manufacturing and analytical support for the registration of the new product candidates. We will be responsible for advancing the product candidates through clinical trials and regulatory submissions.\nunder collaboration arrangements when earned, provided that the milestone event is substantive, its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement, we have no further performance obligations relating to the event and collectability is reasonably assured. If these criteria are not met, we recognize milestone payments ratably over the remaining period of our performance obligations under the collaboration agreement.\nOn September 29, 2015, the USPTO granted us Patent No. 9,144,568, which pertains to the use of EP-3102 Bendeka. The patent extends to March 2033.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal revenue increased $47.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $66.2 million as compared to $19.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2014.\nIn the years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 we realized proceeds from the sale of our New Jersey state net operating losses of $1.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.\nWe currently have four product candidates in advanced stages of development, and/or under review for approval by the FDA. Additionally, we have other exploratory candidates under a collaborative agreement entered into in January 2016 with Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (\"AMRI\"). Our four advanced candidates are EP-6101 KangioTM ready-to-use (\"RTU\") bivalirudin, currently under review for approval by the FDA, EP-4104 (dantrolene sodium) ( EP-4104\u201d) for exertional heat stroke (\"EHS\"), and EP-5101 (pemetrexed) ( EP-5101\u201d). Our leading near-term product candidate is KangioTM, a patented liquid intravenous form of Angiomax for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. EP-3101 is tentatively approved and we may begin commercializing in May 2016. Both EP-5101 and the potential label expansion of Ryanodex into EHS may address unmet medical needs in major specialty markets.\nTotal revenue increased $5.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 to $19.1 million as compared to $13.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2013.\nProduct sales. We recognize net revenues from products manufactured and supplied to our commercial partners, when the following four basic revenue recognition criteria under the related accounting guidance are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Prior to the shipment of our manufactured products, we conduct initial product release and stability testing in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. Our commercial partners can return the products within contracted specified timeframes if the products do not meet the applicable inspection tests. We estimate our return reserves based on our experience with historical return rates. Historically, our product returns have not been material.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which revises the guidance in ASC 825-10, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, and provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. The guidance is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on our financial position and results of operations.\n \u2022 unit sales prices; and \nWe account for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all stock-based payments made to employees and directors based on estimated grant date fair values. We use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, or Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the calculation of expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. The risk-free interest rate was determined with the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options.\nResearch and development expenses incurred in the year ended December 31, 2015 were higher than in the year ended September 30, 2014 mainly as a result of increased project spending for EP-5101 related to registration batches, technical transfer and manufacturing services, for EP-3102 Bendeka related to pre-launch inventory write-offs and certain professional expenses, and for KangioTM related to FDA filling fees, legal costs and development costs to support product approval. In addition, there was increased spending for the successful completion of the clinical treatment portion of the safety and efficacy study of Ryanodex for EHS. Salary and other personnel-related expenses increased due to increased staffing and higher overall compensation costs. These increases were offset by a reduction in project spending for EP-3101RTD due to the timing of research and development activities for diclofenac-misoprostol due to product approval.\nOn March 14, 2014 we received FDA approval of our Abbreviated New Drug Application for diclofenac-misoprostol tablets. In May 2014, we submitted additional data to the FDA with respect to manufacturing procedures of the product and final approval was achieved in June 2014.\n\n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by our commercial partners, Sandoz and The Medicines Company; \nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to our financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Not all of these significant accounting policies, however, require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates.\u201d We have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition, accounting for fair value of warrant liabilities and share-based compensation described below are critical accounting estimates.\u201d\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2014 was $(13.8) million. Net loss for the period was $(18.0) million offset by non-cash adjustments of approximately $1.3 million from the change in the value of the warrant liability, depreciation and stock-based compensation expense. Net changes in working capital increased cash from operating activities by approximately $2.9 million, due to a decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.2 million related to prepaid insurance, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $(3.4) million. We experienced an increase in accounts receivable of $(2.2) million, an increase of $(1.3) million in inventory and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $9.6 million. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued royalties. The total amount of accounts receivable at September 30, 2014 was approximately $7.3 million, which included approximately $0.7 million of product sales and approximately $6.2 million of royalty income, all with payment terms of 45 days, and approximately $0.4 million of other receivables. For royalty income, the 45-day period starts at the end of the quarter upon receipt of the royalty statement detailing the amount of sales in the prior completed quarter, and, for product sales, the period starts upon delivery of product.\nresults, or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nIncome Tax Benefit\nRevenues\nOur product portfolio now includes five approved products: EP-1101 (argatroban) ( EP-1101\u201d), Ryanodex\u00ae (dantrolene sodium) ( Ryanodex\u201d), docetaxel injection, non-alcohol formulation ( Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection\u201d), diclofenac-misoprostol, and EP-3102 (rapidly infused bendamustine RTD) ( EP-3102 Bendeka\u201d). We have three commercial partners: Teva, who markets EP-3102 Bendeka and The Medicines Company ( MDCO\u201d) and Sandoz Inc. ( Sandoz\u201d), who pursuant to separate agreements market EP-1101. Our recently approved EP-3102 Bendeka was commercially launched by Teva in January 2016.\n\u2022the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment
