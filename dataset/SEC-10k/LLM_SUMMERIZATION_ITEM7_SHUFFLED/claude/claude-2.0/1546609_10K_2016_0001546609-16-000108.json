MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Also see Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nOverview\nMVP REIT, Inc. (the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d) was incorporated on April 3, 2012 as a Maryland corporation, and has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Pursuant to its initial public offering, which closed in September 2015, the Company received net consideration of approximately $97.3 million for the issuance of its common stock. Of this amount, approximately $19.5 million of common shares were issued in consideration of the contribution of commercial properties to the Company. The Company has also registered up to $50 million for the issuance of common stock pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the DRIP\u201d) under which common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock.\nThe Company's investment strategy was to invest available net proceeds from its offering in direct investments in real property and real estate secured loans that meet the Company's investment objectives and strategies. In March 2014, the Company's board of directors approved a plan to increase the focus of the Company's investment strategy on parking and self-storage facilities located throughout the United States as the Company's core assets. In June 2014, the Company's board decided to further focus its efforts primarily on parking facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had acquired, 18 properties with the purchase price totaling approximately $87.4 million, including closing costs, which includes a 30% minority interest held by third parties on one property. The Company has a 100% ownership interest in each of the other acquired properties. These acquisitions were funded by the initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities.\nDuring January 2015, the Company acquired 100% interest in a parking facility located in Denver CO. The Company purchased the property for approximately $0.6 million.\nOn March 16, 2015, the Company closed on its $23.3 million purchase of a multi-level parking garage. The parking garage consists of 1,013 parking spaces and approximately 11,828 square feet of office space. The parking garage is located in Fort Worth, Texas. The purchase price included assumption of the existing financing which has a maturity date of August 2021, a balance of approximately $12.2 million, and an interest rate of 5.59% per annum. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction.\nOn March 31, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of 54 parking spaces, located in Milwaukee, WI, for a purchase price of $1 million. The property is leased to SP Plus Corporation, a nationwide parking operator. During the company's due diligence of the property it was discovered that the soil and ground water at the subject property had been impacted by the site's historical use as a printing press as well as neighboring property uses. As a result, the company has retained a local environmental engineer to seek a closure letter or similar certificate of no further action from the State of Wisconsin due to the Company's use of the property as a parking lot. As of December 31, 2015 management does not anticipate a material adverse effect related to this environmental matter.\nOn May 13, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot with 55,021 square feet and has 221 parking spaces located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of approximately $2.6 million. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction. The parking garage is leased to SP Plus Corporation.\nOn May 28, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot with 90,750 square feet and has 265 parking spaces located in Houston, TX, for approximately $8.4 million. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction. The parking garage is leased to iPark Services, LLC.\nOn June 29, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot located in St. Louis, MO, for approximately $3.5 million. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction. The parking lot consists of 46,683 square feet, has 202 parking spaces, zoned I (CBD) and allows for a maximum building height of 200 feet. The parking lot is leased by SP Plus Corporation.\nOn June 30, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot located in Milwaukee, WI, for approximately $3.9 million. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction. The parking lot consists of 41,487 square feet and has 95 spaces, zoned C9-E, and allows for a maximum building height of 40 feet. The parking lot is leased by PCAM, LLC.\nOn July 10, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot located in Wildwood, NJ, for approximately $1.0 million in cash ( parking lot #1\u201d). Parking lot #1 consists of 11,250 square feet and has 45 parking spaces. At closing, parking lot #1 was managed by SP Plus Corporation. On December 16, 2015, the Company purchased an adjacent lot for approximately $0.6 million in cash. The parking lot is located at 401 East Glenwood Ave, Wildwood, NJ ( parking lot #2\u201d). Parking lot #2 consists of 13,500 square feet and has 50 spaces. Through the acquisition of the second lot, the management agreement with SP+ has been cancelled and a lease for the two parking lots has been executed.\nOn October 5, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking garage for approximately $10.5 million. The parking garage is located at 120 East Washington Street, Indianapolis, Indiana. The parking garage consists of approximately 52,650 square feet and has approximately 370 parking spaces.

The parking lot is located at 1109 Cherry Street, Kansas City, Missouri. The parking lot consists of approximately 26,304 square feet and has approximately 84 parking spaces. The parking lot is zoned UR. The parking lot is leased by SP Plus.\nOn October 29, 2015, the Company closed on a purchase of a parking lot for approximately $5.0 million in cash. The parking lot is located at 301 E. Washington Street, Indianapolis, IN 46204. The parking lot consists of approximately 46,403 square feet and has approximately 149 parking spaces. The parking lot is leased by Denison Parking Inc., an Indianapolis parking operator.\nOn May 6, 2015, the Company sold the storage unit asset located in Nevada to a non-related third party for approximately $5.4 million. Proceeds of approximately $2.7 million from this sale paid the promissory note for this property in full. The gain on sale is approximately $0.3 million.\nOn October 29, 2015, the Company also sold a 376-unit self-storage facility located in Cedar Park, TX owned by its wholly owned subsidiary, MVP MS Cedar Park 2012, LLC to Calico Industries-CP, LLC, a Texas limited liability company. The sale price was $4.3 million which sale price was paid at the closing, less customary closing costs. The gain on sale is approximately $1.0 million.\nOn January 2, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture with MVP REIT II, Inc. to purchase the membership interests of an entity that owns two parking lots located in Minneapolis for a purchase price of approximately $15,495,000 plus closing costs. The purchase will be accomplished through a limited liability company owned jointly by the Company and MVP REIT II, Inc. The Company's share of the purchase price is approximately $13,495,000 plus closing costs and the Company will own an 87.09% interest in the limited liability company. The first parking lot is located at 1022 Hennepin Avenue (the Hennepin lot\u201d). The Hennepin lot consists of approximately 90,658 square feet and has approximately 270 parking spaces. The second parking lot is located at 41 10th Street North (the 10th Street lot\u201d). The 10th street lot consists of approximately 107,952 square feet and has approximately 185 parking spaces. Both the Hennepin lot and 10th Street lot will be leased by SP Plus, under a net lease agreement where the Company and MVP REIT II, Inc. will be responsible for property taxes and SP Plus will pay for all insurance and maintenance costs.\nOn January 15, 2016, the Company through its wholly owned entity MVP Indianapolis Meridian Lot, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $1.7 million. The property is located at 239 S. Meridian Street, Indianapolis, Indiana. The parking lot consists of approximately 10,290 square feet and has approximately 39 parking spaces. The parking lot is leased to Denison Parking, Inc., an Indianapolis parking operator.\nOn January 20, 2016, the Company through its wholly owned entity MVP Milwaukee Clybourn, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $0.2 million. The property is located at 412 E. Clybourn Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The parking lot consists of 15 parking spaces and is leased to Secure Parking USA, LLC.\nOn February 1, 2016, the Company purchased a parking lot for approximately $3.9 million in cash. The property is located at 1124 N. Old World Third Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin (the Wisconsin parking lot\u201d). The parking lot consists of 38,606 square feet and has 75 parking spaces. The Wisconsin parking lot is leased by SP Plus Corporation.\nOn February 9, 2016, the Company through its wholly owned entity MVP Clarksburg Lot, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $0.6 million in cash. The parking lot is located at 327 Washington Avenue, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26301 (the parking lot\u201d). The parking lot is leased by ABM Parking Services Inc. (\"ABM\"), a national parking operator.\nOn February 12, 2016, the Company along with MVP REIT II through MVP Denver 1935 Sherman, LLC, (\"MVP Denver\"), a Nevada limited liability company, an entity owned 75.51% by MVP and 24.49% by MVP REIT II, closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $2.4 million in cash of which MVP's share was approximately $1.8 million. The parking lot is located at 1935 Sherman Avenue, Denver, Colorado (the Denver parking lot\u201d). The Denver parking lot is leased by SP Plus Corporation.\nOn January 20, 2016, the Company through various wholly owned subsidiaries entered into two loans with Keybank. The first loan is an $8,580,000 loan secured by the following properties in Indianapolis: 110-120 E. Washington Street, and 301 E. Washington Street. The loan has a term of 10 years, is amortized over 25 years and has an interest rate of 4.59% per annum. The second loan is a $3,490,000 loan secured by the following properties in Missouri: 1010 Convention Plaza, St. Louis, 901, 909, 925 Lucas Avenue and 900, 908, 910 & 916 Convention Plaza, St. Louis and 1109 Cherry Street, Kansas City. The loan has a term of 10 years, is amortized over 25 years and has an interest rate of 4.59% per annum.\nThe Company may, from time to time, invest in non-core assets, including investments in companies that manage real estate or mortgage investment companies; however, the Company anticipates that its core investments going forward will be predominantly in parking facilities. In addition, the Company has agreed that no more than 25% of the gross proceeds from its initial public offering will be used to invest in real properties other than parking facilities.\nThe Company operates as a real estate investment trust. The Company is not a mutual fund or an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor is the Company subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, however, our board has delegated to MVP Realty Advisors, LLC, our advisor, authority to manage our day-to-day business, in accordance with our investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. VRM II owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by VRM I; both are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC. The Company's sponsor is MVP Capital Partners, LLC ( MVPCP\u201d or the Sponsor\u201d), an entity owned and managed by Michael V. Shustek, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Michael Shustek owns a significant majority of Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, which is the manager of VRM I, VRM II and Vestin Fund III ( VF III\u201d).\nVRM I, an OTC Markets-listed company, and VRM II, a Nasdaq-listed company, are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Advisor Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate amount of fees and expense reimbursements waived by the Advisor was approximately $6.9 million. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company may compete against VRM I and VRM II for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. For additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\u201d and Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nResults of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had acquired 18 properties of which our share of the purchase price totaled $87.4 million, including closing costs. These acquisitions were funded by the proceeds from our initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities. We completed our initial public offering in September 2015, and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as we seek to deploy our offering proceeds. Many of our acquisitions were completed in 2015 and, as a result, we held many of our properties for less than a year. We expect that income and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets. As a result, the results of operations described below may not be indicative of future results of operations.\nComparison of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015, to the year ended December 31, 2014:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> Rental revenues (by property)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ft.

Increase in total rental revenues is mainly due to the additional properties owned and operated by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSee Note I - Acquisitions and Note J - Assets held for sale of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>910,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>775,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>678,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,649,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,898,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operation and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>987,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>422,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>799,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,023,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,374,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncrease in operating expenses is mainly due to the additional properties owned and operated by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.

Additionally, during June 2014, the Company's Board approved a sale of its interest in two additional office buildings to VRM I and VRM II. The net income from the office buildings is reported as discontinued operations. Subsequently, during January 2015, management entered into a plan to sell the storage unit assets resulting in the financial reporting of these assets, liabilities and results of operations related to the assets held for sale, as discontinued operations. The sale of the storage assets resulted in a gain on sale of investment in real estate held for sale of approximately $1.3 million.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe Advisor believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Additionally, publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, the Company believes that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nIn order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, adding back asset impairment write-downs, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, the Company believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, making comparisons less meaningful.\nThe Investment Program Association ( IPA\u201d) issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 (the IPA MFFO Guideline\u201d) on November 2, 2010, which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations ( MFFO\u201d). In computing MFFO, FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent, amortization of in-place lease valuations, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss), and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Management is responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk. To achieve our objectives, the Company may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments, if any, the Company may enter into interest rate cap agreements and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency exposure, if any, the Company may enter into foreign currency hedges. The Company views fair value adjustments of derivatives, impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations, assessments regarding general market conditions, and the specific performance of properties owned, which can change over time.\nNo less frequently than annually, the Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event.\nThe Company adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a helpful indicator of our on-going portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level. More specifically, MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT's operations. MFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends. By providing FFO and MFFO, the Company presents information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management's analysis of long-term operating activities. MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions, as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other non-traded REITs, as MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and the Company believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. As explained below, management's evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Straight-line rent. Most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting. As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Amortization of in-place lease valuation. As this item is a cash flow adjustment made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Acquisition-related costs. The Company was organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property and loans secured by real estate in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders. In the process, the Company incurs non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs, which in accordance with GAAP, are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income (loss) from operations and net income (loss).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from the offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate. If the Company acquires a property after all offering proceeds from the offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. In evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time, management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments' revenues and expenses. Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect our operating results, cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired, as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets. By excluding acquisition-related costs, MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made. However, it can provide an indication of our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after the Company ceases to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis, which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours. Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor all of these reasons, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO, in addition to income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO. Additionally, MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value. The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if the Company does not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed. However, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO. Therefore, FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other organization body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and the Company may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure.\nOur calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> Net Loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,212,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtract:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred rental assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (132,000)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of investment in real estate held for sale </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,260,000) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 799,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,805,000)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to non-affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 678,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,649,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MFFO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,522,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital and Liquidity Resources\nThe Company commenced operations on December 11, 2012 and acquired our first property on December 14, 2012.\nOur principal demand for funds will be for the acquisition of real estate assets, funding of loans secured by real estate, the payment of operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions to our stockholders. Over time, the Company intends to generally fund its operating expenses from its cash flow from operations. The cash required for acquisitions and investments in real estate will be funded primarily from the sale of shares through our distribution reinvestment plan, dispositions of properties in our portfolio and through third party financing and the assumption of debt on acquired properties.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.4 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses such as management fees, accounting fees, legal bills and expenses related to real estate owned held for sale. Operating cash flows were provided by the receipt of proceeds from our assets held for sale. Net cash used in investing activities consisted mainly of cash used in investment of real estate of approximately $48.6 million, deposits on future acquisitions of approximately $15.7 million and provided by proceeds from the sale of Red Mountain and Cedar Park of approximately $9.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of commissions of approximately $58.5 million and proceeds from a promissory note of approximately $3.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities consisted of payments on redeemed shares of approximately $0.4 million, payments on notes payable of approximately $0.7 million, payments on notes payable - held for sale of approximately $4.3 million and distributions to stockholders of approximately $2.9 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company has four promissory notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $29 million secured by our real estate. Our charter precludes us from borrowing more than the NASAA REIT Guidelines limit of 300% of our net assets, unless a majority of our independent directors approve any borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets and the justification for such excess borrowing is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report. The Company expects that it may use leverage for any senior debt or equity investments that the Company makes. The Company expects that our debt financing, if any, on such investments will not exceed 50% of the greater of the cost or fair market value of our overall investments.\nThe Company will experience a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate our assets and may experience a temporary, relative increase in liquidity if and when investments are sold, to the extent such sales generate proceeds that are available for additional investments. Our advisor may, but is not required to, establish working capital reserves from offering proceeds out of cash flow generated by our investments or out of proceeds from the sale of our investments. The Company does not anticipate establishing a general working capital reserve during the initial stages of the offering; however, we may establish capital reserves with respect to particular investments. The Company also may, but is not required to, establish reserves out of cash flow generated by investments or out of net sale proceeds in non-liquidating sale transactions. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions and major capital expenditures. Our lenders also may require working capital reserves.\nTo the extent that the working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash generated from operations or through short-term borrowing. In addition, subject to the limitations previously described in our prospectus, the Company may incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of any real estate asset, refinance the debt thereon, arrange for the leveraging of any previously unfinanced property or reinvest the proceeds of financing or refinancing in additional properties.\nIn addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, the Company expects to use its capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and the selling agent(s). During the organization and offering stage, these payments included payments to the selling agent(s) for selling commissions and payments to our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses. During the acquisition and development stage, the Company expects to make payments to our advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us. For a discussion of the compensation to be paid to our advisor, see Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company\u201d, included in Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our advisor and our board of directors.\nManagement Compensation Summary\nThe following table summarizes all compensation and fees incurred by us and paid or payable to our Advisor and its affiliates in connection with our organization, our initial public offering and our operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling Commissions - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition Fees - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,649,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,856,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset Management Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 500,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 350,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt Financing Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,215,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,237,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistributions\nThe Company intends to continue making regular cash distributions to its stockholders, typically on a monthly basis. The actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by our board of directors in its discretion and typically will depend on the amount of funds available for distribution, which is impacted by current and projected cash requirements, tax considerations and other factors. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company must make distributions equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income\u201d each year.\nOn October 3, 2012, the Company confirmed that its board of directors had approved a plan for payment of initial monthly cash distributions of $0.045 per share. On January 25, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors had approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.2 percent, or $0.558 per share annually and $0.0465 per share monthly, assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The distribution rate, which had previously been 6 percent, increased beginning with the January 2013 distribution. On June 4, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors has approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.7%, or $0.60 per share annually and $0.05025 monthly assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The Company anticipates paying future distributions monthly in arrears, with a record date on the 24th of each month and distributions paid on the 10th day of the following month (or the next business day if the 10th is not a business day).\nFrom inception through December 31, 2015, the Company has paid approximately $7.0 million in distributions including approximately $1.7 million in DRIP distributions to the Company's stockholders, all of which have constituted a return of capital. Our total distributions paid for the period presented, the sources of such distributions, the cash flows provided by (used in) operations and the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, are detailed below.\nTo date, all distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and represent a return of capital.\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions paid in Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions paid through DRIP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Distributions Paid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Operations (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1st Quarter, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>535,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>683,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(911,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2nd Quarter, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>623,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>888,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(436,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3rd Quarter, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>751,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>388,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,139,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(394,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4th Quarter 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,015,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>590,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,605,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(717,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,924,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,391,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,315,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,458,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions paid in Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distributions paid through DRIP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Distributions Paid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Operations (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1st Quarter, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 400,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 447,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (978,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2nd Quarter, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 422,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 60,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 482,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 498,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3rd Quarter, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 443,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 78,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 521,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,245,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4th Quarter, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 473,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 94,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 567,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,054,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,738,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 279,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,017,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,779,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions. All or a portion of the distributions may be paid from other sources, such as cash flows from financing activities, borrowings, cash advances from our Advisor, or by way of waiver or deferral of fees. The Company has not established any limit on the extent to which distributions could be funded from these other sources. Accordingly, the amount of distributions paid may not reflect current cash flow from operations and distributions may include a return of capital, rather than a return on capital. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted. The level of distributions will be determined by the board of directors and depend on a number of factors including current and projected liquidity requirements, anticipated operating cash flows and tax considerations, and other relevant items deemed applicable by the board of directors.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into agreements with affiliates of its Sponsor, whereby the Company will pay certain fees or reimbursements to the Advisor or its affiliates in connection with, among other things, acquisition and financing activities, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs. See Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nInflation\nThe Company expects to include provisions in its tenant leases designed to protect the Company from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is organized and conducts operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d) and to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with respect thereto. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income ( Taxable Income\u201d), which is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of Taxable Income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. Our Taxable Income may substantially exceed or be less than our net income as determined based on GAAP, because, differences in GAAP and taxable net income consist primarily of allowances for loan losses or doubtful account, write-downs on real estate held for sale, amortization of deferred financing cost, capital gains and losses, and deferred income.\nA tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation process, based on the technical merits. Based on our evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition on the financial statements. The net income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately zero.\nREIT Compliance\nThe Company filed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective for the year ended December 31, 2013: therefore, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to the stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, including and after the taxable year in which the Company initially elects to be taxed as a REIT, the Company will be subject to federal income taxes on the taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is denied. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect the Company's net income.\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company will be required to distribute at least 90% of the REIT taxable income to the stockholders. The Company must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. The Company will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact the REIT status. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal income taxes (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Company believes it has met all the required criteria to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes as of December 31, 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions is different, it is possible that different accounting policies will be applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses will be recorded, resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements or different amounts reported in the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers to be most critical once we commence significant operations. These policies require complex judgment in their application or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nReal Estate Investments\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nWe are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nWe are required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold, as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented. Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as held for sale\u201d on the balance sheet.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant. Factors considered by us in our analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we will include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period. Estimates of costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are also utilized.\nAbove-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease. The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases. In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, we initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option. The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.\nThe value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases. The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we will utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. We will also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nDeferred Costs\nDeferred costs may consist of deferred financing costs, deferred offering costs and deferred leasing costs. Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing. These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method. Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.\nDeferred offering costs represent professional fees, fees paid to various regulatory agencies, and other costs incurred in connection with registering to sell shares of our common stock.

The Company does not anticipate establishing a general working capital reserve during the initial stages of the offering; however, we may establish capital reserves with respect to particular investments. The Company also may, but is not required to, establish reserves out of cash flow generated by investments or out of net sale proceeds in non-liquidating sale transactions. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions and major capital expenditures. Our lenders also may require working capital reserves.\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> Rental revenues (by property)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ft.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions is different, it is possible that different accounting policies will be applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses will be recorded, resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements or different amounts reported in the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers to be most critical once we commence significant operations. These policies require complex judgment in their application or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nSee Note I - Acquisitions and Note J - Assets held for sale of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn July 10, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot located in Wildwood, NJ, for approximately $1.0 million in cash ( parking lot #1\u201d).

More specifically, MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT's operations. MFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends. By providing FFO and MFFO, the Company presents information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management's analysis of long-term operating activities. MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions, as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other non-traded REITs, as MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and the Company believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. As explained below, management's evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations:\nTo date, all distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and represent a return of capital.\n \u00b7 Amortization of in-place lease valuation. As this item is a cash flow adjustment made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio. \nIn addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, the Company expects to use its capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and the selling agent(s). During the organization and offering stage, these payments included payments to the selling agent(s) for selling commissions and payments to our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses. During the acquisition and development stage, the Company expects to make payments to our advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us. For a discussion of the compensation to be paid to our advisor, see Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company\u201d, included in Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our advisor and our board of directors.\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.\nThe Company commenced operations on December 11, 2012 and acquired our first property on December 14, 2012.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2015, the Company has paid approximately $7.0 million in distributions including approximately $1.7 million in DRIP distributions to the Company's stockholders, all of which have constituted a return of capital. Our total distributions paid for the period presented, the sources of such distributions, the cash flows provided by (used in) operations and the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, are detailed below.\nThe Company's investment strategy was to invest available net proceeds from its offering in direct investments in real property and real estate secured loans that meet the Company's investment objectives and strategies. In March 2014, the Company's board of directors approved a plan to increase the focus of the Company's investment strategy on parking and self-storage facilities located throughout the United States as the Company's core assets. In June 2014, the Company's board decided to further focus its efforts primarily on parking facilities.\nVRM I, an OTC Markets-listed company, and VRM II, a Nasdaq-listed company, are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Advisor Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate amount of fees and expense reimbursements waived by the Advisor was approximately $6.9 million. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nOn January 20, 2016, the Company through its wholly owned entity MVP Milwaukee Clybourn, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $0.2 million. The property is located at 412 E. Clybourn Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The parking lot consists of 15 parking spaces and is leased to Secure Parking USA, LLC.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.4 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses such as management fees, accounting fees, legal bills and expenses related to real estate owned held for sale. Operating cash flows were provided by the receipt of proceeds from our assets held for sale. Net cash used in investing activities consisted mainly of cash used in investment of real estate of approximately $48.6 million, deposits on future acquisitions of approximately $15.7 million and provided by proceeds from the sale of Red Mountain and Cedar Park of approximately $9.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of commissions of approximately $58.5 million and proceeds from a promissory note of approximately $3.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities consisted of payments on redeemed shares of approximately $0.4 million, payments on notes payable of approximately $0.7 million, payments on notes payable - held for sale of approximately $4.3 million and distributions to stockholders of approximately $2.9 million.\nAssets purchased in 2012 and 2013 were sold as of December 31, 2015 and income from those investments is reported as income (loss) from assets held for sale in the discontinued operations, net of income taxes section of our consolidated statements of operations. Increase in total rental revenues is mainly due to the additional properties owned and operated by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Also see Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nOn February 1, 2016, the Company purchased a parking lot for approximately $3.9 million in cash. The property is located at 1124 N. Old World Third Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin (the Wisconsin parking lot\u201d). The parking lot consists of 38,606 square feet and has 75 parking spaces. The Wisconsin parking lot is leased by SP Plus Corporation.\nOverview\nOur calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nInterest expense increased due to the assumption of debt through acquisitions and the financing of our Directors and Officers Liability Insurance. The interest expense will vary based on the amount of our borrowings, which will depend on the cost of borrowings and our ability to identify and acquire real estate and real estate-related assets that meet our investment objectives.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant. Factors considered by us in our analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we will include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period. Estimates of costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are also utilized.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had acquired 18 properties of which our share of the purchase price totaled $87.4 million, including closing costs. These acquisitions were funded by the proceeds from our initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities. We completed our initial public offering in September 2015, and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as we seek to deploy our offering proceeds. Many of our acquisitions were completed in 2015 and, as a result, we held many of our properties for less than a year. We expect that income and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets. As a result, the results of operations described below may not be indicative of future results of operations.\nREIT Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had acquired, 18 properties with the purchase price totaling approximately $87.4 million, including closing costs, which includes a 30% minority interest held by third parties on one property. The Company has a 100% ownership interest in each of the other acquired properties. These acquisitions were funded by the initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities.\n\nAbove-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease. The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases. In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, we initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option. The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.\nContractual Obligations\nIncome Taxes\n\nOn January 15, 2016, the Company through its wholly owned entity MVP Indianapolis Meridian Lot, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $1.7 million. The property is located at 239 S. Meridian Street, Indianapolis, Indiana. The parking lot consists of approximately 10,290 square feet and has approximately 39 parking spaces. The parking lot is leased to Denison Parking, Inc., an Indianapolis parking operator.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOn February 9, 2016, the Company through its wholly owned entity MVP Clarksburg Lot, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $0.6 million in cash. The parking lot is located at 327 Washington Avenue, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26301 (the parking lot\u201d). The parking lot is leased by ABM Parking Services Inc. (\"ABM\"), a national parking operator.\nThe Company may, from time to time, invest in non-core assets, including investments in companies that manage real estate or mortgage investment companies; however, the Company anticipates that its core investments going forward will be predominantly in parking facilities. In addition, the Company has agreed that no more than 25% of the gross proceeds from its initial public offering will be used to invest in real properties other than parking facilities.\n\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we will utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. We will also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nIn order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, adding back asset impairment write-downs, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, the Company believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, making comparisons less meaningful.\nWe are required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold, as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented. Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as held for sale\u201d on the balance sheet.\n\nComparison of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015, to the year ended December 31, 2014:\nA tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation process, based on the technical merits. Based on our evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition on the financial statements. The net income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately zero.\nDeferred costs may consist of deferred financing costs, deferred offering costs and deferred leasing costs. Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing. These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method. Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.\nOn October 29, 2015, the Company also sold a 376-unit self-storage facility located in Cedar Park, TX owned by its wholly owned subsidiary, MVP MS Cedar Park 2012, LLC to Calico Industries-CP, LLC, a Texas limited liability company. The sale price was $4.3 million which sale price was paid at the closing, less customary closing costs. The gain on sale is approximately $1.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company has four promissory notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $29 million secured by our real estate. Our charter precludes us from borrowing more than the NASAA REIT Guidelines limit of 300% of our net assets, unless a majority of our independent directors approve any borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets and the justification for such excess borrowing is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report. The Company expects that it may use leverage for any senior debt or equity investments that the Company makes. The Company expects that our debt financing, if any, on such investments will not exceed 50% of the greater of the cost or fair market value of our overall investments.\nThe Company commenced its initial public offering of its common stock on September 25, 2012 and terminated the offering in September 2015. As of March 29, 2016, the Company had accepted investors' subscriptions for, and issued, 11,068,487 shares of common stock, including shares issued pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan. The Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $75,348,000, additionally the Company issued shares valued at $19,484,000 for contributed properties.\nOn October 9, 2015, the Company closed on a purchase of a parking lot for approximately $0.5 million in cash. The parking lot is located at 1109 Cherry Street, Kansas City, Missouri. The parking lot consists of approximately 26,304 square feet and has approximately 84 parking spaces. The parking lot is zoned UR. The parking lot is leased by SP Plus.\nThe Company filed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective for the year ended December 31, 2013: therefore, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to the stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, including and after the taxable year in which the Company initially elects to be taxed as a REIT, the Company will be subject to federal income taxes on the taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is denied. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect the Company's net income.\nThe Company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions. All or a portion of the distributions may be paid from other sources, such as cash flows from financing activities, borrowings, cash advances from our Advisor, or by way of waiver or deferral of fees. The Company has not established any limit on the extent to which distributions could be funded from these other sources. Accordingly, the amount of distributions paid may not reflect current cash flow from operations and distributions may include a return of capital, rather than a return on capital. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted. The level of distributions will be determined by the board of directors and depend on a number of factors including current and projected liquidity requirements, anticipated operating cash flows and tax considerations, and other relevant items deemed applicable by the board of directors.\nSee Note K - Notes Payable of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur principal demand for funds will be for the acquisition of real estate assets, funding of loans secured by real estate, the payment of operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions to our stockholders. Over time, the Company intends to generally fund its operating expenses from its cash flow from operations. The cash required for acquisitions and investments in real estate will be funded primarily from the sale of shares through our distribution reinvestment plan, dispositions of properties in our portfolio and through third party financing and the assumption of debt on acquired properties.\nOn January 20, 2016, the Company through various wholly owned subsidiaries entered into two loans with Keybank. The first loan is an $8,580,000 loan secured by the following properties in Indianapolis: 110-120 E. Washington Street, and 301 E. Washington Street. The loan has a term of 10 years, is amortized over 25 years and has an interest rate of 4.59% per annum. The second loan is a $3,490,000 loan secured by the following properties in Missouri: 1010 Convention Plaza, St. Louis, 901, 909, 925 Lucas Avenue and 900, 908, 910 & 916 Convention Plaza, St. Louis and 1109 Cherry Street, Kansas City. The loan has a term of 10 years, is amortized over 25 years and has an interest rate of 4.59% per annum.\nThe following table summarizes all compensation and fees incurred by us and paid or payable to our Advisor and its affiliates in connection with our organization, our initial public offering and our operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nNo less frequently than annually, the Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event.\nOn May 13, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot with 55,021 square feet and has 221 parking spaces located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of approximately $2.6 million. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction. The parking garage is leased to SP Plus Corporation.\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company will be required to distribute at least 90% of the REIT taxable income to the stockholders. The Company must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. The Company will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact the REIT status. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal income taxes (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Company believes it has met all the required criteria to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes as of December 31, 2015.\nOn January 2, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture with MVP REIT II, Inc. to purchase the membership interests of an entity that owns two parking lots located in Minneapolis for a purchase price of approximately $15,495,000 plus closing costs. The purchase will be accomplished through a limited liability company owned jointly by the Company and MVP REIT II, Inc. The Company's share of the purchase price is approximately $13,495,000 plus closing costs and the Company will own an 87.09% interest in the limited liability company. The first parking lot is located at 1022 Hennepin Avenue (the Hennepin lot\u201d). The Hennepin lot consists of approximately 90,658 square feet and has approximately 270 parking spaces. The second parking lot is located at 41 10th Street North (the 10th Street lot\u201d). The 10th street lot consists of approximately 107,952 square feet and has approximately 185 parking spaces. Both the Hennepin lot and 10th Street lot will be leased by SP Plus, under a net lease agreement where the Company and MVP REIT II, Inc. will be responsible for property taxes and SP Plus will pay for all insurance and maintenance costs.\nThe Company intends to continue making regular cash distributions to its stockholders, typically on a monthly basis. The actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by our board of directors in its discretion and typically will depend on the amount of funds available for distribution, which is impacted by current and projected cash requirements, tax considerations and other factors. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company must make distributions equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income\u201d each year.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nOn June 30, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot located in Milwaukee, WI, for approximately $3.9 million. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction. The parking lot consists of 41,487 square feet and has 95 spaces, zoned C9-E, and allows for a maximum building height of 40 feet. The parking lot is leased by PCAM, LLC.\nResults of Operations\nThe Advisor believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Additionally, publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, the Company believes that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nMVP REIT, Inc. (the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d) was incorporated on April 3, 2012 as a Maryland corporation, and has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Pursuant to its initial public offering, which closed in September 2015, the Company received net consideration of approximately $97.3 million for the issuance of its common stock. Of this amount, approximately $19.5 million of common shares were issued in consideration of the contribution of commercial properties to the Company. The Company has also registered up to $50 million for the issuance of common stock pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the DRIP\u201d) under which common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock.\nDistributions\nOn May 6, 2015, the Company sold the storage unit asset located in Nevada to a non-related third party for approximately $5.4 million. Proceeds of approximately $2.7 million from this sale paid the promissory note for this property in full. The gain on sale is approximately $0.3 million.\nManagement Compensation Summary\nWe are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nOn February 12, 2016, the Company along with MVP REIT II through MVP Denver 1935 Sherman, LLC, (\"MVP Denver\"), a Nevada limited liability company, an entity owned 75.51% by MVP and 24.49% by MVP REIT II, closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $2.4 million in cash of which MVP's share was approximately $1.8 million. The parking lot is located at 1935 Sherman Avenue, Denver, Colorado (the Denver parking lot\u201d). The Denver parking lot is leased by SP Plus Corporation.\nDuring March 2014, the Company's Board approved a sale of its interest in four office buildings to VRM I and VRM II in exchange for VRM I and VRM II's interest in five parking facilities and a storage facility. Additionally, during June 2014, the Company's Board approved a sale of its interest in two additional office buildings to VRM I and VRM II. The net income from the office buildings is reported as discontinued operations. Subsequently, during January 2015, management entered into a plan to sell the storage unit assets resulting in the financial reporting of these assets, liabilities and results of operations related to the assets held for sale, as discontinued operations. The sale of the storage assets resulted in a gain on sale of investment in real estate held for sale of approximately $1.3 million.\nDuring January 2015, the Company acquired 100% interest in a parking facility located in Denver CO. The Company purchased the property for approximately $0.6 million.\nStatus of Offering\nDeferred offering costs represent professional fees, fees paid to various regulatory agencies, and other costs incurred in connection with registering to sell shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, such costs totaled approximately $2.1 million. As we effectively commenced operations on January 1, 2013, the offering costs previously deferred were being amortized to expense as offering costs over 12 months on a straight-line basis. These costs were fully amortized as of December 31, 2013.\n \u00b7 Straight-line rent. Most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting. As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio. \nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nOn March 31, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of 54 parking spaces, located in Milwaukee, WI, for a purchase price of $1 million. The property is leased to SP Plus Corporation, a nationwide parking operator. During the company's due diligence of the property it was discovered that the soil and ground water at the subject property had been impacted by the site's historical use as a printing press as well as neighboring property uses. As a result, the company has retained a local environmental engineer to seek a closure letter or similar certificate of no further action from the State of Wisconsin due to the Company's use of the property as a parking lot. As of December 31, 2015 management does not anticipate a material adverse effect related to this environmental matter.\n \u00b7 Acquisition-related costs. The Company was organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property and loans secured by real estate in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders. In the process, the Company incurs non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs, which in accordance with GAAP, are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). \nSubsequent Events\nRelated-Party Transactions and Arrangements\nThe Investment Program Association ( IPA\u201d) issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 (the IPA MFFO Guideline\u201d) on November 2, 2010, which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations ( MFFO\u201d). In computing MFFO, FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent, amortization of in-place lease valuations, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss), and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Management is responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk. To achieve our objectives, the Company may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments, if any, the Company may enter into interest rate cap agreements and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency exposure, if any, the Company may enter into foreign currency hedges. The Company views fair value adjustments of derivatives, impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations, assessments regarding general market conditions, and the specific performance of properties owned, which can change over time.\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, however, our board has delegated to MVP Realty Advisors, LLC, our advisor, authority to manage our day-to-day business, in accordance with our investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. VRM II owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by VRM I; both are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC. The Company's sponsor is MVP Capital Partners, LLC ( MVPCP\u201d or the Sponsor\u201d), an entity owned and managed by Michael V. Shustek, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Michael Shustek owns a significant majority of Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, which is the manager of VRM I, VRM II and Vestin Fund III ( VF III\u201d).\nIn addition, the Company may compete against VRM I and VRM II for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. For additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\u201d and Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Company operates as a real estate investment trust. The Company is not a mutual fund or an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor is the Company subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\n\nTo the extent that the working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash generated from operations or through short-term borrowing. In addition, subject to the limitations previously described in our prospectus, the Company may incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of any real estate asset, refinance the debt thereon, arrange for the leveraging of any previously unfinanced property or reinvest the proceeds of financing or refinancing in additional properties.\nReal Estate Investments\nFor all of these reasons, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO, in addition to income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO. Additionally, MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value. The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if the Company does not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed. However, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO. Therefore, FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n \u00b7 These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from the offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate. If the Company acquires a property after all offering proceeds from the offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. In evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time, management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments' revenues and expenses. Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect our operating results, cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired, as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets. By excluding acquisition-related costs, MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made. However, it can provide an indication of our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after the Company ceases to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis, which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours. Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management. \nCapital and Liquidity Resources\nIncrease in operating expenses is mainly due to the additional properties owned and operated by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation expense increased, and will continue to increase, as the Company builds its portfolio of properties.\nOn October 3, 2012, the Company confirmed that its board of directors had approved a plan for payment of initial monthly cash distributions of $0.045 per share. On January 25, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors had approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.2 percent, or $0.558 per share annually and $0.0465 per share monthly, assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The distribution rate, which had previously been 6 percent, increased beginning with the January 2013 distribution. On June 4, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors has approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.7%, or $0.60 per share annually and $0.05025 monthly assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The Company anticipates paying future distributions monthly in arrears, with a record date on the 24th of each month and distributions paid on the 10th day of the following month (or the next business day if the 10th is not a business day).\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other organization body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and the Company may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.\nDeferred Costs\nThe Company has entered into agreements with affiliates of its Sponsor, whereby the Company will pay certain fees or reimbursements to the Advisor or its affiliates in connection with, among other things, acquisition and financing activities, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs. See Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot located in St. Louis, MO, for approximately $3.5 million. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction. The parking lot consists of 46,683 square feet, has 202 parking spaces, zoned I (CBD) and allows for a maximum building height of 200 feet. The parking lot is leased by SP Plus Corporation.\nInflation\nOn October 29, 2015, the Company closed on a purchase of a parking lot for approximately $5.0 million in cash. The parking lot is located at 301 E. Washington Street, Indianapolis, IN 46204. The parking lot consists of approximately 46,403 square feet and has approximately 149 parking spaces. The parking lot is leased by Denison Parking Inc., an Indianapolis parking operator.\nThe Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015.", "item_7_text": "The Company will experience a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate our assets and may experience a temporary, relative increase in liquidity if and when investments are sold, to the extent such sales generate proceeds that are available for additional investments. Our advisor may, but is not required to, establish working capital reserves from offering proceeds out of cash flow generated by our investments or out of proceeds from the sale of our investments. The Company does not anticipate establishing a general working capital reserve during the initial stages of the offering; however, we may establish capital reserves with respect to particular investments. The Company also may, but is not required to, establish reserves out of cash flow generated by investments or out of net sale proceeds in non-liquidating sale transactions. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions and major capital expenditures. Our lenders also may require working capital reserves.\nThe Company expects to include provisions in its tenant leases designed to protect the Company from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market.\nOn May 28, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot with 90,750 square feet and has 265 parking spaces located in Houston, TX, for approximately $8.4 million. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction. The parking garage is leased to iPark Services, LLC.\n\nThe value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases. The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nThe Company is organized and conducts operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d) and to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with respect thereto. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income ( Taxable Income\u201d), which is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of Taxable Income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. Our Taxable Income may substantially exceed or be less than our net income as determined based on GAAP, because, differences in GAAP and taxable net income consist primarily of allowances for loan losses or doubtful account, write-downs on real estate held for sale, amortization of deferred financing cost, capital gains and losses, and deferred income.\nOn October 5, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking garage for approximately $10.5 million. The parking garage is located at 120 East Washington Street, Indianapolis, Indiana. The parking garage consists of approximately 52,650 square feet and has approximately 370 parking spaces. The parking garage is zoned CBD-1 and allows for a maximum building height of five stories. The parking garage is leased by ABM Onsite Services - Midwest, Inc., a subsidiary of ABM Industries, Inc., which trades on the New York Stock Exchange as ticker symbol ABM\u201d.\nThe Company's accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions is different, it is possible that different accounting policies will be applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses will be recorded, resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements or different amounts reported in the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers to be most critical once we commence significant operations. These policies require complex judgment in their application or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nSee Note I - Acquisitions and Note J - Assets held for sale of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn July 10, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot located in Wildwood, NJ, for approximately $1.0 million in cash ( parking lot #1\u201d). Parking lot #1 consists of 11,250 square feet and has 45 parking spaces. At closing, parking lot #1 was managed by SP Plus Corporation. On December 16, 2015, the Company purchased an adjacent lot for approximately $0.6 million in cash. The parking lot is located at 401 East Glenwood Ave, Wildwood, NJ ( parking lot #2\u201d). Parking lot #2 consists of 13,500 square feet and has 50 spaces. Through the acquisition of the second lot, the management agreement with SP+ has been cancelled and a lease for the two parking lots has been executed.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTotal rental revenue earned is from our 18 consolidated properties, which were acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nOn March 16, 2015, the Company closed on its $23.3 million purchase of a multi-level parking garage. The parking garage consists of 1,013 parking spaces and approximately 11,828 square feet of office space. The parking garage is located in Fort Worth, Texas. The purchase price included assumption of the existing financing which has a maturity date of August 2021, a balance of approximately $12.2 million, and an interest rate of 5.59% per annum. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction.\nThe Company adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a helpful indicator of our on-going portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level. More specifically, MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT's operations. MFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends. By providing FFO and MFFO, the Company presents information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management's analysis of long-term operating activities. MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions, as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other non-traded REITs, as MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and the Company believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. As explained below, management's evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations:\nTo date, all distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and represent a return of capital.\n \u00b7 Amortization of in-place lease valuation. As this item is a cash flow adjustment made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio. \nIn addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, the Company expects to use its capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and the selling agent(s). During the organization and offering stage, these payments included payments to the selling agent(s) for selling commissions and payments to our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses. During the acquisition and development stage, the Company expects to make payments to our advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us. For a discussion of the compensation to be paid to our advisor, see Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company\u201d, included in Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our advisor and our board of directors.\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.\nThe Company commenced operations on December 11, 2012 and acquired our first property on December 14, 2012.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2015, the Company has paid approximately $7.0 million in distributions including approximately $1.7 million in DRIP distributions to the Company's stockholders, all of which have constituted a return of capital. Our total distributions paid for the period presented, the sources of such distributions, the cash flows provided by (used in) operations and the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, are detailed below.\nThe Company's investment strategy was to invest available net proceeds from its offering in direct investments in real property and real estate secured loans that meet the Company's investment objectives and strategies. In March 2014, the Company's board of directors approved a plan to increase the focus of the Company's investment strategy on parking and self-storage facilities located throughout the United States as the Company's core assets. In June 2014, the Company's board decided to further focus its efforts primarily on parking facilities.\nVRM I, an OTC Markets-listed company, and VRM II, a Nasdaq-listed company, are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Advisor Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate amount of fees and expense reimbursements waived by the Advisor was approximately $6.9 million. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nOn January 20, 2016, the Company through its wholly owned entity MVP Milwaukee Clybourn, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $0.2 million. The property is located at 412 E. Clybourn Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The parking lot consists of 15 parking spaces and is leased to Secure Parking USA, LLC.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.4 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses such as management fees, accounting fees, legal bills and expenses related to real estate owned held for sale. Operating cash flows were provided by the receipt of proceeds from our assets held for sale. Net cash used in investing activities consisted mainly of cash used in investment of real estate of approximately $48.6 million, deposits on future acquisitions of approximately $15.7 million and provided by proceeds from the sale of Red Mountain and Cedar Park of approximately $9.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of commissions of approximately $58.5 million and proceeds from a promissory note of approximately $3.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities consisted of payments on redeemed shares of approximately $0.4 million, payments on notes payable of approximately $0.7 million, payments on notes payable - held for sale of approximately $4.3 million and distributions to stockholders of approximately $2.9 million.\nAssets purchased in 2012 and 2013 were sold as of December 31, 2015 and income from those investments is reported as income (loss) from assets held for sale in the discontinued operations, net of income taxes section of our consolidated statements of operations. Increase in total rental revenues is mainly due to the additional properties owned and operated by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Also see Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nOn February 1, 2016, the Company purchased a parking lot for approximately $3.9 million in cash. The property is located at 1124 N. Old World Third Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin (the Wisconsin parking lot\u201d). The parking lot consists of 38,606 square feet and has 75 parking spaces. The Wisconsin parking lot is leased by SP Plus Corporation.\nOverview\nOur calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nInterest expense increased due to the assumption of debt through acquisitions and the financing of our Directors and Officers Liability Insurance. The interest expense will vary based on the amount of our borrowings, which will depend on the cost of borrowings and our ability to identify and acquire real estate and real estate-related assets that meet our investment objectives.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant. Factors considered by us in our analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we will include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period. Estimates of costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are also utilized.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had acquired 18 properties of which our share of the purchase price totaled $87.4 million, including closing costs. These acquisitions were funded by the proceeds from our initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities. We completed our initial public offering in September 2015, and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as we seek to deploy our offering proceeds. Many of our acquisitions were completed in 2015 and, as a result, we held many of our properties for less than a year. We expect that income and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets. As a result, the results of operations described below may not be indicative of future results of operations.\nREIT Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had acquired, 18 properties with the purchase price totaling approximately $87.4 million, including closing costs, which includes a 30% minority interest held by third parties on one property. The Company has a 100% ownership interest in each of the other acquired properties. These acquisitions were funded by the initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities.\n\nAbove-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease. The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases. In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, we initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option. The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.\nContractual Obligations\nIncome Taxes\n\nOn January 15, 2016, the Company through its wholly owned entity MVP Indianapolis Meridian Lot, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $1.7 million. The property is located at 239 S. Meridian Street, Indianapolis, Indiana. The parking lot consists of approximately 10,290 square feet and has approximately 39 parking spaces. The parking lot is leased to Denison Parking, Inc., an Indianapolis parking operator.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOn February 9, 2016, the Company through its wholly owned entity MVP Clarksburg Lot, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $0.6 million in cash. The parking lot is located at 327 Washington Avenue, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26301 (the parking lot\u201d). The parking lot is leased by ABM Parking Services Inc. (\"ABM\"), a national parking operator.\nThe Company may, from time to time, invest in non-core assets, including investments in companies that manage real estate or mortgage investment companies; however, the Company anticipates that its core investments going forward will be predominantly in parking facilities. In addition, the Company has agreed that no more than 25% of the gross proceeds from its initial public offering will be used to invest in real properties other than parking facilities.\n\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we will utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. We will also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nIn order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, adding back asset impairment write-downs, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, the Company believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, making comparisons less meaningful.\nWe are required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold, as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented. Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as held for sale\u201d on the balance sheet.\n\nComparison of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015, to the year ended December 31, 2014:\nA tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation process, based on the technical merits. Based on our evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition on the financial statements. The net income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately zero.\nDeferred costs may consist of deferred financing costs, deferred offering costs and deferred leasing costs. Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing. These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method. Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.\nOn October 29, 2015, the Company also sold a 376-unit self-storage facility located in Cedar Park, TX owned by its wholly owned subsidiary, MVP MS Cedar Park 2012, LLC to Calico Industries-CP, LLC, a Texas limited liability company. The sale price was $4.3 million which sale price was paid at the closing, less customary closing costs. The gain on sale is approximately $1.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company has four promissory notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $29 million secured by our real estate. Our charter precludes us from borrowing more than the NASAA REIT Guidelines limit of 300% of our net assets, unless a majority of our independent directors approve any borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets and the justification for such excess borrowing is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report. The Company expects that it may use leverage for any senior debt or equity investments that the Company makes. The Company expects that our debt financing, if any, on such investments will not exceed 50% of the greater of the cost or fair market value of our overall investments.\nThe Company commenced its initial public offering of its common stock on September 25, 2012 and terminated the offering in September 2015. As of March 29, 2016, the Company had accepted investors' subscriptions for, and issued, 11,068,487 shares of common stock, including shares issued pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan. The Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $75,348,000, additionally the Company issued shares valued at $19,484,000 for contributed properties.\nOn October 9, 2015, the Company closed on a purchase of a parking lot for approximately $0.5 million in cash. The parking lot is located at 1109 Cherry Street, Kansas City, Missouri. The parking lot consists of approximately 26,304 square feet and has approximately 84 parking spaces. The parking lot is zoned UR. The parking lot is leased by SP Plus.\nThe Company filed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective for the year ended December 31, 2013: therefore, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to the stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, including and after the taxable year in which the Company initially elects to be taxed as a REIT, the Company will be subject to federal income taxes on the taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is denied. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect the Company's net income.\nThe Company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions. All or a portion of the distributions may be paid from other sources, such as cash flows from financing activities, borrowings, cash advances from our Advisor, or by way of waiver or deferral of fees. The Company has not established any limit on the extent to which distributions could be funded from these other sources. Accordingly, the amount of distributions paid may not reflect current cash flow from operations and distributions may include a return of capital, rather than a return on capital. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted. The level of distributions will be determined by the board of directors and depend on a number of factors including current and projected liquidity requirements, anticipated operating cash flows and tax considerations, and other relevant items deemed applicable by the board of directors.\nSee Note K - Notes Payable of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur principal demand for funds will be for the acquisition of real estate assets, funding of loans secured by real estate, the payment of operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions to our stockholders. Over time, the Company intends to generally fund its operating expenses from its cash flow from operations. The cash required for acquisitions and investments in real estate will be funded primarily from the sale of shares through our distribution reinvestment plan, dispositions of properties in our portfolio and through third party financing and the assumption of debt on acquired properties.\nOn January 20, 2016, the Company through various wholly owned subsidiaries entered into two loans with Keybank. The first loan is an $8,580,000 loan secured by the following properties in Indianapolis: 110-120 E. Washington Street, and 301 E. Washington Street. The loan has a term of 10 years, is amortized over 25 years and has an interest rate of 4.59% per annum. The second loan is a $3,490,000 loan secured by the following properties in Missouri: 1010 Convention Plaza, St. Louis, 901, 909, 925 Lucas Avenue and 900, 908, 910 & 916 Convention Plaza, St. Louis and 1109 Cherry Street, Kansas City. The loan has a term of 10 years, is amortized over 25 years and has an interest rate of 4.59% per annum.\nThe following table summarizes all compensation and fees incurred by us and paid or payable to our Advisor and its affiliates in connection with our organization, our initial public offering and our operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nNo less frequently than annually, the Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event.\nOn May 13, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot with 55,021 square feet and has 221 parking spaces located in St. Louis, Missouri, for a purchase price of approximately $2.6 million. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction. The parking garage is leased to SP Plus Corporation.\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company will be required to distribute at least 90% of the REIT taxable income to the stockholders. The Company must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. The Company will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact the REIT status. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal income taxes (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Company believes it has met all the required criteria to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes as of December 31, 2015.\nOn January 2, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture with MVP REIT II, Inc. to purchase the membership interests of an entity that owns two parking lots located in Minneapolis for a purchase price of approximately $15,495,000 plus closing costs. The purchase will be accomplished through a limited liability company owned jointly by the Company and MVP REIT II, Inc. The Company's share of the purchase price is approximately $13,495,000 plus closing costs and the Company will own an 87.09% interest in the limited liability company. The first parking lot is located at 1022 Hennepin Avenue (the Hennepin lot\u201d). The Hennepin lot consists of approximately 90,658 square feet and has approximately 270 parking spaces. The second parking lot is located at 41 10th Street North (the 10th Street lot\u201d). The 10th street lot consists of approximately 107,952 square feet and has approximately 185 parking spaces. Both the Hennepin lot and 10th Street lot will be leased by SP Plus, under a net lease agreement where the Company and MVP REIT II, Inc. will be responsible for property taxes and SP Plus will pay for all insurance and maintenance costs.\nThe Company intends to continue making regular cash distributions to its stockholders, typically on a monthly basis. The actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by our board of directors in its discretion and typically will depend on the amount of funds available for distribution, which is impacted by current and projected cash requirements, tax considerations and other factors. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company must make distributions equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income\u201d each year.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nOn June 30, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot located in Milwaukee, WI, for approximately $3.9 million. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction. The parking lot consists of 41,487 square feet and has 95 spaces, zoned C9-E, and allows for a maximum building height of 40 feet. The parking lot is leased by PCAM, LLC.\nResults of Operations\nThe Advisor believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Additionally, publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, the Company believes that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nMVP REIT, Inc. (the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d) was incorporated on April 3, 2012 as a Maryland corporation, and has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Pursuant to its initial public offering, which closed in September 2015, the Company received net consideration of approximately $97.3 million for the issuance of its common stock. Of this amount, approximately $19.5 million of common shares were issued in consideration of the contribution of commercial properties to the Company. The Company has also registered up to $50 million for the issuance of common stock pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the DRIP\u201d) under which common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock.\nDistributions\nOn May 6, 2015, the Company sold the storage unit asset located in Nevada to a non-related third party for approximately $5.4 million. Proceeds of approximately $2.7 million from this sale paid the promissory note for this property in full. The gain on sale is approximately $0.3 million.\nManagement Compensation Summary\nWe are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nOn February 12, 2016, the Company along with MVP REIT II through MVP Denver 1935 Sherman, LLC, (\"MVP Denver\"), a Nevada limited liability company, an entity owned 75.51% by MVP and 24.49% by MVP REIT II, closed on the purchase of a parking lot for approximately $2.4 million in cash of which MVP's share was approximately $1.8 million. The parking lot is located at 1935 Sherman Avenue, Denver, Colorado (the Denver parking lot\u201d). The Denver parking lot is leased by SP Plus Corporation.\nDuring March 2014, the Company's Board approved a sale of its interest in four office buildings to VRM I and VRM II in exchange for VRM I and VRM II's interest in five parking facilities and a storage facility. Additionally, during June 2014, the Company's Board approved a sale of its interest in two additional office buildings to VRM I and VRM II. The net income from the office buildings is reported as discontinued operations. Subsequently, during January 2015, management entered into a plan to sell the storage unit assets resulting in the financial reporting of these assets, liabilities and results of operations related to the assets held for sale, as discontinued operations. The sale of the storage assets resulted in a gain on sale of investment in real estate held for sale of approximately $1.3 million.\nDuring January 2015, the Company acquired 100% interest in a parking facility located in Denver CO. The Company purchased the property for approximately $0.6 million.\nStatus of Offering\nDeferred offering costs represent professional fees, fees paid to various regulatory agencies, and other costs incurred in connection with registering to sell shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, such costs totaled approximately $2.1 million. As we effectively commenced operations on January 1, 2013, the offering costs previously deferred were being amortized to expense as offering costs over 12 months on a straight-line basis. These costs were fully amortized as of December 31, 2013.\n \u00b7 Straight-line rent. Most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting. As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio. \nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nOn March 31, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot consisting of 54 parking spaces, located in Milwaukee, WI, for a purchase price of $1 million. The property is leased to SP Plus Corporation, a nationwide parking operator. During the company's due diligence of the property it was discovered that the soil and ground water at the subject property had been impacted by the site's historical use as a printing press as well as neighboring property uses. As a result, the company has retained a local environmental engineer to seek a closure letter or similar certificate of no further action from the State of Wisconsin due to the Company's use of the property as a parking lot. As of December 31, 2015 management does not anticipate a material adverse effect related to this environmental matter.\n \u00b7 Acquisition-related costs. The Company was organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property and loans secured by real estate in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders. In the process, the Company incurs non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs, which in accordance with GAAP, are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). \nSubsequent Events\nRelated-Party Transactions and Arrangements\nThe Investment Program Association ( IPA\u201d) issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 (the IPA MFFO Guideline\u201d) on November 2, 2010, which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations ( MFFO\u201d). In computing MFFO, FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent, amortization of in-place lease valuations, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss), and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Management is responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk. To achieve our objectives, the Company may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments, if any, the Company may enter into interest rate cap agreements and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency exposure, if any, the Company may enter into foreign currency hedges. The Company views fair value adjustments of derivatives, impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations, assessments regarding general market conditions, and the specific performance of properties owned, which can change over time.\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, however, our board has delegated to MVP Realty Advisors, LLC, our advisor, authority to manage our day-to-day business, in accordance with our investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. VRM II owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by VRM I; both are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC. The Company's sponsor is MVP Capital Partners, LLC ( MVPCP\u201d or the Sponsor\u201d), an entity owned and managed by Michael V. Shustek, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Michael Shustek owns a significant majority of Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, which is the manager of VRM I, VRM II and Vestin Fund III ( VF III\u201d).\nIn addition, the Company may compete against VRM I and VRM II for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. For additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\u201d and Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Company operates as a real estate investment trust. The Company is not a mutual fund or an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor is the Company subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\n\nTo the extent that the working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash generated from operations or through short-term borrowing. In addition, subject to the limitations previously described in our prospectus, the Company may incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of any real estate asset, refinance the debt thereon, arrange for the leveraging of any previously unfinanced property or reinvest the proceeds of financing or refinancing in additional properties.\nReal Estate Investments\nFor all of these reasons, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO, in addition to income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO. Additionally, MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value. The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if the Company does not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed. However, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO. Therefore, FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n \u00b7 These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from the offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate. If the Company acquires a property after all offering proceeds from the offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. In evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time, management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments' revenues and expenses. Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect our operating results, cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired, as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets. By excluding acquisition-related costs, MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made. However, it can provide an indication of our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after the Company ceases to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis, which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours. Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management. \nCapital and Liquidity Resources\nIncrease in operating expenses is mainly due to the additional properties owned and operated by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation expense increased, and will continue to increase, as the Company builds its portfolio of properties.\nOn October 3, 2012, the Company confirmed that its board of directors had approved a plan for payment of initial monthly cash distributions of $0.045 per share. On January 25, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors had approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.2 percent, or $0.558 per share annually and $0.0465 per share monthly, assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The distribution rate, which had previously been 6 percent, increased beginning with the January 2013 distribution. On June 4, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors has approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.7%, or $0.60 per share annually and $0.05025 monthly assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The Company anticipates paying future distributions monthly in arrears, with a record date on the 24th of each month and distributions paid on the 10th day of the following month (or the next business day if the 10th is not a business day).\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other organization body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and the Company may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.\nDeferred Costs\nThe Company has entered into agreements with affiliates of its Sponsor, whereby the Company will pay certain fees or reimbursements to the Advisor or its affiliates in connection with, among other things, acquisition and financing activities, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs. See Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Company closed on the purchase of a parking lot located in St. Louis, MO, for approximately $3.5 million. The Company paid customary closing costs in connection with the transaction. The parking lot consists of 46,683 square feet, has 202 parking spaces, zoned I (CBD) and allows for a maximum building height of 200 feet. The parking lot is leased by SP Plus Corporation.\nInflation\nOn October 29, 2015, the Company closed on a purchase of a parking lot for approximately $5.0 million in cash. The parking lot is located at 301 E. Washington Street, Indianapolis, IN 46204. The parking lot consists of approximately 46,403 square feet and has approximately 149 parking spaces. The parking lot is leased by Denison Parking Inc., an Indianapolis parking operator.\nThe Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015.", "item_7_tables": "Table 64: <table> <tr> <td> Rental revenues (by property)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ft.

It completed its initial public offering in September 2015, raising $97.3 million.\n\n- In 2015, the company acquired 18 properties totaling $87.4 million. Most acquisitions occurred in 2015 so income and expenses increased significantly compared to 2014.\n\n- Total rental revenue in 2015 was $4.65 million compared to $0.66 million in 2014 due to acquiring more properties. \n\n- Operating expenses increased from $3.4 million in 2014 to $6 million in 2015, mainly due to more properties and acquisition costs.\n\n- Net loss in 2015 was $1.2 million compared to net income of $0.9 million in 2014, primarily due to acquisition costs.\n\n- The company paid $2.9 million in distributions to shareholders in 2015, all of which were considered return of capital rather than return on capital.\n\n- As of December 31, 2015, the company had $29 million in debt secured by real estate assets. It expects to use leverage up to 50% of the cost of investments.\n\n- The company's liquidity will decrease as proceeds from the public offering are used to acquire properties. Liquidity may increase if properties are sold.\n\n- Critical accounting policies include valuation of real estate assets, allocation of purchase price, revenue recognition, and funds from operations.\n\nIn summary, the company is in a high growth and acquisition phase but is not yet profitable due to acquisition costs and operating expenses. Leverage and liquidity are important factors to monitor going forward."}
