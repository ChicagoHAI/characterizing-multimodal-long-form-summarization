Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 15 of this 2015 Form 10-K. The discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical in nature. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this 2015 Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a REIT primarily engaged in the business of investing, on a leveraged basis, in a diversified portfolio of mortgage assets, including Agency RMBS, Non-Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS, residential mortgage loans, and real estate related securities. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return.\nWe focus our investment activities primarily on acquiring Non-Agency and Agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, ( MBS\u201d), and on purchasing residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 46% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS, 20% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, and 34% of our investment portfolio was securitized residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2014, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 52% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS, 16% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, and 32% of our investment portfolio was securitized residential mortgage loans.\nWe make investment decisions based on various factors, including expected cash yield, relative value, risk-adjusted returns, current and projected credit fundamentals, current and projected macroeconomic considerations, current and projected supply and demand, credit and market risk concentration limits, liquidity, cost of financing and financing availability, as well as maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act.\nWe have engaged in transactions with residential mortgage lending operations of leading commercial banks and other originators in which we identified and re-underwrote residential mortgage loans owned by such entities, and purchased and securitized such residential mortgage loans. In the past we have also acquired formerly AAA-rated Non-Agency RMBS and immediately re-securitized those securities. We sold the resulting AAA-rated super senior RMBS and retained the rated or unrated mezzanine and subordinate RMBS.\nOur investment strategy is intended to take advantage of opportunities in the current interest rate and credit environment. We expect to adjust our strategy to changing market conditions by shifting our asset allocations across these various asset classes as interest rate and credit cycles change over time. We believe that our strategy will enable us to pay dividends and achieve capital appreciation throughout changing market cycles. We expect to take a long-term view of assets and liabilities, and our reported earnings and estimates of the fair value of our investments at the end of a financial reporting period will not significantly impact our objective of providing attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long-term.\nWe use leverage to seek to increase our potential returns and to finance the acquisition of our assets. Our income is generated primarily by the difference, or net spread, between the income we earn on our assets and the cost of our borrowings. We expect to finance our investments using a variety of financing sources including, when available, repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities and securitizations. We may manage our debt and interest rate risk by utilizing interest rate hedges, such as interest rate swaps, caps, options and futures to reduce the effect of interest rate fluctuations related to our financing sources.\nWe have elected and believe we are organized and have operated in a manner that qualifies us to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. A REIT generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. Furthermore, substantially all of our assets consist of qualified REIT real estate assets (of the type described in Code Section 856(c)(5)). We calculate that at least 75% of our assets were qualified REIT assets, as defined in the Code, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We also calculate that our revenues qualified for the 75% REIT income test and for the 95% REIT income test for years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. We also met all REIT requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our REIT taxable income. Therefore, as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we believe that we qualified as a REIT under the Code.\nWe operate our business to be exempt from registration under the 1940 Act, and therefore we are required to invest a substantial majority of our assets in loans secured by mortgages on real estate and real estate-related assets. Subject to maintaining our REIT qualification and our 1940 Act exemption, we do not have any limitations on the amounts we may invest in any of our targeted asset classes.\nLooking forward, we cannot predict the percentage of our assets that will be invested in each asset class or whether we will invest in other classes of investments. We may change our investment strategy and policies without a vote of our stockholders.\nBusiness Environment\nThe interest rate environment over the last three years has been extremely volatile. During that period, we have experienced many fluctuations in the 10-year Treasury yield that have exceeded 50 basis points (0.50%) in a short timeframe. More broadly, the global fixed income, equity and commodity markets experienced market turbulence and increased volatility during 2015 as investors braced and waited for the Federal Reserve Bank to increase rates.\nDuring this volatile market period, we have continued to acquire investments that we believe provide a risk-adjusted return and income that support the dividend that we distribute to our investors.\nInvestment Portfolio\nFor our credit portfolio, we acquired, in the third quarter of 2014, the subordinate notes and call rights with respect to seven residential mortgage loan securitizations sponsored by Springleaf Financial. As planned, we exercised the calls rights to acquire the remaining residential mortgage loans, and then securitized those mortgage loans, for one of the Springleaf transactions in 2014 and for three of the Springleaf transactions that were eligible to be called in 2015. By exercising our call rights and securitizing the remaining mortgage loans, we were able to increase structural leverage while reducing interest costs on our investment in the mortgage loans. In addition, we executed one other securitization of seasoned subprime collateral in the second quarter of 2015.\nTo reduce the rate sensitivity of our Agency portfolio, we decreased our exposure to Agency MBS by more than $2.5 billion during 2015. We also sold Agency MBS with a 4% coupon for Agency MBS with a 3.5% coupon to mitigate prepayment risk as rates declined at certain points during 2015. At December 31, 2014, our portfolio of 4% Agency MBS was 75% of our total Agency MBS compared to 29% by December 31, 2015, while our portfolio of 3.5% Agency MBS increased from 18% at December 31, 2014 to 35% at December 31, 2015. We also significantly increased our Agency CMBS portfolio in 2015. We began the year with less than $250 million of Agency CMBS and increased this portfolio over $700 million to $952 million as of December 31, 2015. Our Agency CMBS portfolio is less interest rate sensitive than our Agency MBS portfolio because our Agency CMBS have lock out periods and prepayment penalties that protect the portfolio against prepayment risk, as well as attractive risk adjusted yields.\nBusiness Operations\nAs discussed in Item 1 Business\u201d section, in August 2015, we became internally managed. Specifically, we now have employees and no longer rely on a third-party manager to operate our business. In connection with the Internalization, we have relocated to new office space in New York, and hired the additional staff necessary to complete the internalization. Further, before year end, we built, tested, and completed the construction of a new data center, back up facility and have an independent software suite. We expect operating expenses to be lower on an internalized basis compared to the prior externally managed model and have eliminated certain inherent conflicts particular to externally managed companies.\nStock Buy Back\nIn August 2015, we announced a $250 million stock buyback plan. Immediately following the announcement, we entered into a share repurchase agreement with Annaly to acquire the 9 million shares owned by Annaly. We used the remaining amount available after the purchase of shared owned by Annaly to purchase shares in the open market during the third and fourth quarter of 2015. The stock buyback reduced shares outstanding by 18 million shares or 9% of shares outstanding prior to the buyback. On February 18, 2016, the Board of Directors increased the existing share buyback program by $100 million to $350 million.\nNet Income Summary\nThe table below presents our net income on a GAAP basis

Interest income increased by $185 million, or 27%, to $873 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $688 million for the same period of 2014. This increase in interest income was offset by an increase of $111 million in interest expense to $259 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $148 million for the same period of 2014. This resulted in an overall increase of $73 million in net interest income, year over year as we have continued to rebalance our portfolio to more Non-Agency holdings with higher costs of financing, but higher interest returns.\nThe overall decrease in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period of 2014 is attributable primarily to an increase in net unrealized losses on financial instruments at fair value of $352 million. The Company recognized an unrealized loss for the year ended 2015 of $158 million, compared to an unrealized gain on financial instruments at fair value of $194 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. A significant portion of our financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. This can result in significant changes in net income as prices change as a result of changes in market conditions.\nOur net income increased by $226 million to $589 million, or $2.87 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $363 million, or $1.77 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 over the same period of 2013 is primarily attributable to higher interest income, net of interest expense, of $130 million, to $540 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $410 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase in net interest income is due to the increase in invested assets from the acquisition of additional Agency RMBS and securitized loans held for investment. In addition to the increase in net interest income, we recognized gains as a result of changes in fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value of $238 million. The Company recognized a gain of $194 million in fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a loss of $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This gain from increase in fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value was offset by net unrealized losses on derivatives as a result of changes in fair value on derivatives of $138 million. The Company recognized net unrealized losses on derivatives of $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a gain of $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nWe discuss the changes in our net income in greater detail in the discussion on our results of operations below.\nResults of Operations for the years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nOur primary source of income is interest income earned on our assets. Our economic net interest income equals interest income excluding interest earned on cash and cash equivalents less interest expense and realized losses on our interest rate hedges.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased by $185 million, or 27%, to $873 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $688 million for the same period of 2014. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loan pools during the second half of 2014 and 2015. Seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans contributed $288 million of interest income during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $104 million for the same period of 2014. In addition we also increased our agency holdings which contributed an additional $12 million in interest income for the year as compared to 2014. These increases were offset by a decline in interest income of $38 million on our Non-Agency RMBS and jumbo prime securitizations held in consolidated VIEs as these portfolios continue to run-off.\nInterest income increased by $176 million, or 34%, to $688 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $512 million for the same period of 2013. The increase is primarily due to the increase in agency holdings of approximately $6.4 billion acquired during 2014 and the increase in securitized loans of approximately $4.5 billion also acquired during 2014. Interest income on our Agency RMBS portfolio increased by $110 million and interest income on our securitized loan portfolio increased by $100 million. Both portfolios increased from the prior year due to acquisitions during 2014 financed by additional repurchase agreements and secured debt as we increased our leverage ratio during 2014.The increases are partially offset by a decline in interest income on our Non-Agency portfolio of $34 million year over year as natural principal payments and expected losses have reduced the interest earning balance of these assets.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $111 million, or 76%, to $259 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $148 million for the same period of 2014. The increase is primarily due to increased interest expense of $95 million on our securitized debt collateralized by seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans due to the financing added for the acquisition of seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans during the second half of 2014 and in 2015. Interest expense on repurchase agreements increased by $33 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014, as repurchase agreements balances increased to finance both the Agency and Non-Agency portfolio. The interest rates were higher on repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency and Non-Agency MBS. The increase in interest rates for repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was driven by market factors and the increase in interest rates for repurchase agreements collateralized by Non-Agency MBS was driven by the addition of longer term repurchase agreements and anticipated increase in the federal funds rate. These increases were offset by a decline in interest expense of $23 million on our securitized debt, collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS and jumbo prime securitizations held in our consolidated VIEs as this portfolio continues to run-off.\nInterest expense increased by $46 million, or 45%, to $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $102 million for the same period of 2013. The increase is primarily due to increased interest expense of $24 million on our securitized debt and $21 million on our repurchase agreements. During 2014, we increased leverage to finance additional investments in Agency RMBS, Non-Agency RMBS, as well as securitized loans held for investment. Our repurchase agreement obligation increased by $6.8 billion to $8.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 as compared to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2013.\nInterest expense for GAAP reporting does not include the periodic costs of our derivatives, which are reported separately.\nNet Economic Interest Income\nOur economic net interest income equals interest income, less interest expense and realized losses on our interest rate swaps. Realized losses on our interest rate swaps are the periodic net settlement payments made or received. For the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures throughout this section, interest expense includes net payments on our interest rate swaps, which is presented as a part of Realized gains (losses) on derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest rate swaps are used to manage the increase in interest paid on repurchase agreements in a rising rate environment. Presenting the net contractual interest payments on interest rate swaps with the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities reflects our total contractual interest payments. We believe this presentation is useful to investors because it depicts the economic value of our investment strategy by showing actual interest expense and net interest income. Where indicated, interest expense, including interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic interest expense. Where indicated, net interest income reflecting interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic net interest income.\nThe following table reconciles the GAAP and non-GAAP measurements reflected in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> GAAP\nInterest\nIncome\n</td>

million for the same period of 2014. Our net interest rate spread, which equals the yield on our average assets less the economic average cost of funds decreased by approximately 90 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. The net interest margin, which equals the net economic interest income as a percentage of the net average balance of our interest-earning assets less our interest-bearing liabilities, decreased by 100 basis for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. Average earning assets increased by $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the same period of the prior year, primarily as a result of the increase in subprime residential mortgage loans held for investment. Our net interest margin declined due to a decline in the total average yield on our interest-earning assets which was not fully offset by the decline in our average cost of funds. The portfolio has experienced several changes from the same period for the prior year as we have increased our average Agency RMBS and seasoned sub-prime securitized loans held for investment and our jumbo prime securitized loans have declined as a percentage of the total portfolio. These changes have increased our leverage, resulting in lower net interest rate spreads, but higher total interest income.\nEconomic Interest Expense and the Cost of Funds\nThe borrowing rate at which we are able to finance our assets using repurchase agreements is typically correlated to LIBOR and the term of the financing. The table below shows our average borrowed funds, economic interest expense, average cost of funds (inclusive of realized losses on interest rate swaps), average one-month LIBOR, average six-month LIBOR, average one-month LIBOR relative to average six-month LIBOR, and average cost of funds relative to average one- and six- month LIBOR.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Debt\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Economic\nInterest\nExpense (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nCost of\nFunds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average One-\nMonth\nLIBOR\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Six-\nMonth\nLIBOR\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average One-\nMonth\nLIBOR\nRelative to\nAverage Six-\nMonth\nLIBOR\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Cost\nof Funds\nRelative to\nAverage One-\nMonth\nLIBOR\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Cost\nof Funds\nRelative to Average Six-Month LIBOR\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Ratios have been annualized, dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,190,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>304,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.28 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.02 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,889,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.38 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,527,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.51 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.22 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,913,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.38 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.97 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended September 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,859,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.51 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.31 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.09 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended June 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,799,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.42 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.24 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.08 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended March 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,311,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.21 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Includes effect of realized losses on interest rate swaps.\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased by $4.3 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. Economic interest expense increased by $104 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities is a result of the increase in leverage from Agency and Non-Agency repurchase agreements and securitized debt entered during, 2015, offset by declines in our securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS. The additional financing was used to increase our Agency RMBS and securitized residential mortgage loans. Our interest expense has increased due to the increase in average interest-bearing liabilities.\nContributing to the overall increased economic interest expense are higher interest rates. Average one-month and six month LIBOR were up four basis point and 15 basis points, respectively, in the year of 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. While we do acquire interest rate hedges to mitigate changes in interest rate risks, the hedges may not fully offset interest expense movements.\nNet other-than-temporary credit impairment losses\nOTTI losses are generated when fair values decline below our amortized cost basis, an unrealized loss, and the expected future cash flows decline from prior periods, an adverse change. When an unrealized loss and an adverse change in cash flows occur, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings. In addition, if we intend to sell a security, or believe we will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings equal to the unrealized loss.\nOTTI losses were $67 million, $64 million and $45 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Of these amounts, $58 million, $59 million and $38 million of the OTTI for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was related to securities included in our consolidated VIEs. As of December 31, 2015, we had 26 non-agency RMBS securities subject to OTTI in an unrealized loss position totaling $10 million for which we did not recognize impairment. We intend to hold these securities until they recover their amortized cost. We continue to monitor our investment portfolio and will record an OTTI for all investments in an unrealized loss position for which we do not believe we will recover our amortized cost prior to maturity or sale.\nNet gains (losses) on derivatives\nThe table below shows a summary of our net gain (loss) on derivative instruments, for the quarters ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2013\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Periodic interest cost of interest rate swaps, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(47,227 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(52,523 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,857 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage Options\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Treasury Futures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,523 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38,552 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,029 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Swaptions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(353 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Derivative Assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(415 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Swaps - Terminations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(98,949 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total realized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(134,795 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,329 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,144 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized gain on derivative instruments, net:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rate Swaps\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(84,913 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,740 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage Options\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Treasury Futures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,856 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,629 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Swaptions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,294 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,067 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(103,496 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,369 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(114,637 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(186,348 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,656 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur derivative portfolio primarily includes interest rate swaps, swaptions, Treasury futures, and mortgage options. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we terminated interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of $1.5 billion for $99 million. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, swaps with a notional value of $800 million matured. These terminations and maturities were offset by an additional $1.5 billion of swaps and swaptions added during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced our Treasury positions by $488 million of notional. Changes in our derivative positions were a result of changes in the portfolio composition and changes in interest rates.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized net losses on derivatives of $115 million compared to net losses of $186 million for the same period of 2014. The net gains and losses on our derivatives include both unrealized and realized gains and losses. Realized gains and losses include the net cash paid and received on our interest rate swaps during the period as well as sales and settlements of our Treasury futures and mortgage options. The realized loss on our derivative instruments is primarily a result of the pay fixed leg of our swaps carried at a higher interest rate than the received floating leg of these same swaps resulting in a net payment on the periodic settlement of the swaps during the year. We also incurred realized losses on our treasury futures for the year ended 2014 as interest rates declined during the year, resulting in net payments to close out our future positions as they came due.\nUnrealized gains and losses include the change in market value, period over period, on our derivatives portfolio. Changes in market value are generally a result of changes in interest rates. The unrealized gains and losses of our derivatives portfolio are generally offset by net changes in our investment portfolio. We may or may not ultimately realize these unrealized derivative gains and losses depending on trade activity, changes in interest rates and the values of the underlying securities.\nOur interest rate swaps are primarily used to economically hedge the effects of changes in interest rates on our portfolio specifically our floating rate debt. Therefore, we included the periodic interest costs of the interest rate swaps for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 on these economic hedges in our presentation of economic net interest income and our net interest spreads. As we do not account for these as hedges for GAAP presentation, we present these gains and losses separately in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The increase in the net periodic interest cost of the interest rate swaps are primarily due to declines in interest rates year over year as we pay a fixed rate on our interest rate swaps and are receiving a lower floating rate.\nTreasury futures are not included in our economic interest expense and economic net interest income. We also do not include any gains or losses on our mortgage options in our economic interest expense and economic net interest income as the mortgage options were sold for income generation and not as an economic hedge for changes in interest rates in our portfolio. As we identify opportunities in the mortgage backed securities market, we may from time to time purchase or sell mortgage options, including both call and put options to take advantage of these opportunities. We had no mortgage options as of December 31, 2015. The realized gains on our mortgage options for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $445 thousand, $7.5 million and $12 million, respectively.\nNet Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments at Fair Value\nWe have elected the fair value option with changes in fair value reflected in earnings for our Agency and Non-Agency IO RMBS securities, securitized loans held for investment and the related financing for the securitized loans consolidated as a VIE in our statement of financial condition.

the changes in fair values of the securities from the prior period. Unrealized gains and losses on our entire Agency and Non-Agency RMBS portfolio are reflected in earnings. IO securities represent the right to receive the interest on a pool of mortgage backed securities, including both Agency and Non-Agency mortgage pools. The fair value of IO RMBS securities are heavily impacted by changes in expected prepayment rates. When IO securities prepay, the holder of the IO security will receive less interest on the investment due to the reduced principal. During the second quarter of 2015, we acquired residual interests in several seasoned pools of mortgage loans. These holdings generally do not have a traditional unpaid principal amount and pay cash based on guidance in the trust documents when excess cash is available. Many of these holdings do not pay any interest and may never pay interest. We have elected to carry these residual interests at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. As of January 1, 2015, the Company adopted the guidance in ASU 2014-13, Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity, which allowed us to carry both the assets and liabilities of certain consolidated VIEs at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded unrealized losses in earnings of $158 million, unrealized gain of $194 million and unrealized loss of $44 million, respectively, on the financial instruments carried at fair value.\nGains and Losses on Sales of Assets and Loss on extinguishment of securitized debt\nNet realized gains on sales of investments were $77 million, $92 million and $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We do not forecast sales of investments as we generally expect to invest for long term gains. However, from time to time, we may sell assets to create liquidity necessary to pursue new opportunities, achieve targeted leverage ratios as well as for gains when prices indicate a sale is most beneficial to us, or is the most prudent course of action to maintain a targeted risk adjusted yield for our investors.\nDuring 2015, the Company also purchased $1.3 billion of securitized debt collateralized by subprime residential mortgage loans for a cash payment of $1.3 billion resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6 million. During 2014, the Company purchased $54 million of securitized debt collateralized by non-agency RMBS for cash payments of $56 million, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2 million. When the Company acquires its outstanding debt, it extinguishes the outstanding debt and recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the carrying value of the debt and the cost to acquire the debt which is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income as a loss on extinguishment of debt during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nManagement Fees, Compensation, General and Administrative Expenses and Deal Expenses\nOn August 5, 2015, as discussed above under The Internalization,\u201d we announced the mutual agreement to terminate the Management Agreement between us and our Manager, effective immediately. Thus, as of August 5, 2015, we began incurring compensation expense as we are now internally managed (whereas prior to the Internalization, such expenses were incurred by our Manager, and we paid a management fee). The table below shows our total management fee and general and administrative, or G&A, expenses, compensation and benefit expense and deal expenses as compared to average total assets and average equity for the periods presented.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Net Management\nFee, Compensation and\nOther Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Net Management\nFee, Compensation and\nOther Expenses/Average\nAssets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Net Management\nFee, Compensation and\nOther Expenses/Average\nEquity\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Ratios have been annualized, dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.05 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Year Ended December 31, 2014 (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.45 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended September 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended June 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.04 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended March 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.57 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Does not include one-time management fee reduction of $24 million\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe incurred management fees of $25 million, $33 and $26 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We also recognized reimbursements from FIDAC related to the amended Management Agreement of approximately $7 million, $9 million and $7 million for each of the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The management fee is based on our stockholders' equity as defined in the Management Agreement. See further discussion of the management fee, including amendments to the Management Agreement, as well as other agreements with FIDAC in our discussion of related party transactions below.\nIn connection with the Internalization and the termination of the Management Agreement, we became internally managed and hired employees. Thus, as of August 5, 2015, we began to incur compensation and benefits costs. Compensation and benefits costs have replaced the management fee as the cost to operate our business. Compensation and benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11 million.\nG&A expenses were approximately $32 million, $20 million and $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in G&A expenses is primarily due to transition costs incurred as part of the Internalization of $9 million, which occurred during the second half of 2015. We also incurred deal expenses $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the call and re-securitization of certain of our subprime mortgage pools.\nIn addition, during the third quarter of 2014, we received a reimbursement of prior management fees paid to FIDAC of $24 million which did not recur in 2015.\nServicing Fees\nServicing fees paid by our consolidated VIEs were approximately $25 million, $10 million and $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These servicing fees are related to the consolidation of the whole loan securitization vehicles and are paid from interest income earned by the VIEs. The increase in servicing fees is primarily due to the addition of subprime mortgage loans from the prior year. Subprime mortgage loans average asset balance increased to $4.5 billion for year ended December 31, 2015 from $1.4 billion for the same period of 2014.\nNet Income (Loss) and Return on Average Equity\nThe table below shows our economic net interest income, realized gains (losses) on sale of assets and the credit related OTTI, realized and unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps and IOs, total management fee and G&A expenses, and income tax, each as a percentage of average equity, and the return on average equity for the periods presented.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Economic Net Interest\nIncome/Average Equity *\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Realized Gains\n(Losses) on Sales and\nOTTI/Average\nEquity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Realized and Unrealized\nGains (Losses) on Interest\nRate Swaps and IOs/Average\nEquity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Management Fee,\nCompensation and G&A\nExpenses/Average Equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Return on Average Equity\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Ratios have been annualized)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>15.70% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.01%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.42%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.05%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.58% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>14.06% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.67% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.83%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.31%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.99% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td> </td> <td>11.70% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.72% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.29%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.00%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.55% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>14.98% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.27% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.54%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.45%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.02% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended September 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>15.05% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.74%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.72% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.18%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.89%) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended June 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>15.06% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.00%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.55% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.04%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.64% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For The Quarter Ended March 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>17.06% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.44% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.96%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.57%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.52% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> * Includes effect of realized losses on interest rate swaps.\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net income was $250 million, $589 million and $363 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Economic net interest income as a percentage of average equity increased by 164 basis point at December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. Return on average equity decreased by 541 basis point for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014 due to lower income in the year 2015, primarily as a result of unrealized losses on financial instruments at fair value.\nCore earnings\nCore earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income excluding unrealized gains on the aggregate portfolio, impairment losses, realized gains on sales of investments, realized gains or losses on futures, realized gains or losses on swap terminations, gain on deconsolidation, extinguishment of debt and certain other non-recurring gains or losses. As defined, core earnings include interest income and expense as well as realized losses on interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk. Core earnings are provided for the purpose of comparability to other peer issuers, but have important limitations. Core earnings as described above helps evaluate our financial performance without the impact of certain transactions and is of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, core earnings should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net income or net income per basic share computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table provides GAAP measures of net income and net income per basic share available to common stockholders for the periods presented and details with respect to reconciling the line items to core earnings and related per

The table and discussion below present our estimated economic book value. We calculate and disclose this non-GAAP measurement because we believe it represents an estimate of the fair value of the assets we own or are able to dispose of, pledge, or otherwise monetize. The estimated economic book value should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for book value computed in accordance with GAAP.\nGAAP requires us to consolidate certain securitizations and re-securitization transactions where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. In these transactions, we transfer assets to the trusts, which issue tranches of senior and subordinate notes or certificates. We sell the senior tranches and therefore have no continuing involvement in these trusts other than being a holder of notes or certificates issued by the trusts, with the same rights as other holders of the notes or certificates. However, with respect to certain VIEs collateralized by loans held for investment, we have the ability to approve loan modifications and determine the course of action to be taken as it relates to loans in technical default, including whether or not to proceed with foreclosure. The notes and certificates we own that were issued by the trusts are largely subordinated interests in those trusts. The trusts have no recourse to our assets other than pursuant to a breach by us of the transaction documents related to the transfer of the assets by us to the trusts, but are presented as if we own 100% of the trust.\nFor re-securitized RMBS transactions and loan securitizations, we present the pre-securitized assets transferred into the consolidated trusts in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Non-Agency or Securitized loans held for investment. Post securitization RMBS assets sold are presented as liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Securitized debt, collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS and Securitized debt, collateralized by loans held for investment. We have presented the underlying securities we transferred to the trusts for the calculation of GAAP book value at fair value and recorded the corresponding liability for the notes or certificates sold to third parties at amortized cost or fair value. Fair value adjustments that are not credit related are recorded in Other comprehensive income. Credit related impairments are deemed other-than-temporary and are recorded in earnings.\nBecause we are unable to dispose of, monetize or pledge the RMBS or loans we transferred into the trusts, we also present our estimated economic book value. We believe this measure represents the estimated value of the securities issued by these trusts that we own. In contrast to GAAP book value, our estimated economic book value considers only the assets we own or are able to dispose of, pledge, or otherwise monetize. To determine our estimated economic book value, we consider only the fair value of the notes or certificates issued by the securitization and re-securitization trusts that we actually own. Accordingly, our estimated economic book value does not include assets or liabilities for which we have no direct ownership, specifically the notes or certificates of the securitization and re-securitization trusts that were sold to third parties.\nAt December 31, 2015, the difference between GAAP book value and estimated economic book value was $196 million, or $1.05 per share. At December 31, 2014, the difference between GAAP book value and estimated economic book value was $336 million, or $1.65 per share. This difference is primarily driven by the value of the RMBS assets we have retained in these re-securitization transactions as compared to the value of consolidated loans and securities net of RMBS assets sold, but treated as a secured financing on the statement of financial condition. In these re-securitization transactions, we have generally retained the subordinated, typically non-rated, first loss notes or certificates issued by the securitization trusts. These securities are complex, typically locked out as to principal repayment, relatively illiquid, and do not necessarily appreciate or depreciate in tandem with the broader Non-Agency RMBS market or with the loans on securities owned by the trusts. As the senior notes pay off, we expect the difference between our economic and our GAAP book value to decrease. The tables below present the adjustments to GAAP book value that we believe are necessary to adequately reflect our calculation of estimated economic book value as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP Book Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,946,188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP Book Value per Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.70 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Economic Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assets of Consolidated VIEs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,908,910 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Recourse Liabilities of Consolidated VIEs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,249,911 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interests in VIEs eliminated in consolidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,462,713 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjustments - Net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(196,286 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjustments - Net (per share)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.05 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Economic Book Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,749,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Economic Book Value per Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.65 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP Book Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,607,690 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP Book Value per Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Economic Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assets of Consolidated VIEs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,798,794 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Recourse Liabilities of Consolidated VIEs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,095,278 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interests in VIEs eliminated in consolidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,367,953 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjustments - Net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(335,563 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjustments - Net (per share)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.65 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Economic Book Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,272,127 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Economic Book Value per Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.90 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur estimate of economic book value has important limitations. Our estimate of fair value is as of a point in time and subject to significant judgment, primarily the estimate of the fair value of the securities issued by the trusts which we own and can freely sell or pledge. Should we sell the assets in our portfolio, we may realize materially different proceeds from the sale than we have estimated as of the reporting date.\nThe calculation of estimated economic book value described above is used by management to understand the fair value of the assets we own and the liabilities for which we are legally obligated, and is presented for informational use only. The estimated economic book value should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for book value computed in accordance with GAAP.\nPortfolio Review\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, on an aggregate basis, we purchased $7.7 billion of invested assets, sold $7.7 billion of invested assets, and received $1.4 billion in principal payments related to our Agency and Non-Agency RMBS. In addition, we used $2.1 billion of proceeds received from principal and interest on our investments to repay principal on our securitized debt.\nThe following table summarizes certain characteristics of our portfolio at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest earning assets at period-end (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,959,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,170,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest bearing liabilities at period-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,689,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,550,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage at period-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 4.0:1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.8:1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage at period-end (recourse)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2.7:1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.6:1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio Composition, at amortized cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Agency RMBS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior, interest only\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated, interest only\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RMBS transferred to consolidated VIEs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agency MBS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-only\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securitized loans held for investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed-rate percentage of portfolio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustable-rate percentage of portfolio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annualized yield on average interest earning assets for the year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annualized cost of funds on average borrowed funds for the year ended (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Excludes cash and cash equivalents.\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (2) Includes the effect of realized losses on interest rate swaps.\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents details of each asset class in our portfolio at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

Resources\nGeneral\nLiquidity measures our ability to meet cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay our borrowings, purchase RMBS, mortgage loans and other assets for our portfolio, pay dividends and other general business needs. Our principal sources of capital and funds for additional investments primarily include earnings from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities, and proceeds from equity offerings.\nTo meet our short term (one year or less) liquidity needs, we expect to continue to borrow funds in the form of repurchase agreements and, subject to market conditions, other types of financing. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our master repurchase agreements generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or SIFMA, as to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all securities we have initially sold under the repurchase transaction. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, cross default provisions, required haircuts (or the percentage that is subtracted from the value of RMBS that collateralizes the financing), purchase price maintenance requirements, and requirements that all disputes related to the repurchase agreement be litigated or arbitrated in a particular jurisdiction. These provisions may differ for each of our lenders.\nWe also expect to meet our short term liquidity needs by relying on the cash flows generated by our investments. These cash flows are primarily comprised of monthly principal and interest payments received on our investments. We may also sell our investments and utilize those proceeds to meet our short term liquidity needs or enter into non-recourse financing of our assets through sales of securities to third parties of loan securitizations or RMBS re-securitization transactions, similar to transactions that we have completed in prior periods.\nBased on our current portfolio, leverage ratio and available borrowing arrangements, we believe our assets will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short-term liquidity requirements. However, a decline in the value of our collateral could cause a temporary liquidity shortfall due to the timing of margin calls on the financing arrangements and the actual receipt of the cash related to principal paydowns. If our cash resources are at any time insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may have to sell investments, potentially at a loss, or issue debt or additional equity securities in a common stock offering.\nTo meet our longer term liquidity needs (greater than one year), we expect our principal sources of capital and funds to continue to be provided by earnings from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities, as well as proceeds from equity offerings.\nIn addition to the principal sources of capital described above, we may enter into warehouse facilities and use longer dated structured repurchase agreements. The use of any particular source of capital and funds will depend on market conditions, availability of these facilities, and the investment opportunities available to us.\nCurrent Period\nWe held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $114 million and $165 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. As a result of our operating, investing and financing activities described above, our cash position decreased by $51 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\nOur operating activities provided net cash of approximately $396 million, 183 million and $305 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The cash provided by our operations is primarily due to interest received in excess of interest paid during the period. During 2015, interest received net of interest paid was $645 million. This cash received was offset in part by payments on derivatives of $158 million, including $99 million paid for termination of existing swaps during the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2014, interest received net of interest paid was $466 million. During 2014, we paid cash to cover margin requirements on our interest rate swaps and other financial instruments of approximately $186 million, which is primarily reflected in other assets and other payments from derivative sales and settlements during the year ended December 31, 2014. The cash provided by operating activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to prior year due primarily to a decrease in interest collected on the portfolio, net of interest paid, of $61 million, offset in part by lower management fees paid during 2013 as compared to prior year.\nOur investing activities provided cash of approximately $2.0 billion, used cash of $6.1 billion and provided cash of $305 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we purchased investments of $7.7 billion, primarily Agency RMBS. This use of cash was offset during the year from sales of investments of $7.7 billion and principal repayments of $2.2 billion. The purchases and sales activity was primarily due to our continuing to balance our Agency portfolio to maximize spread income and provide liquidity for purchases of Non-Agency RMBS and mortgage loan pools. During the year ended December 31, 2014 we purchased investments of $12.1 billion, primarily Agency RMBS and securitized loans. This use of cash was offset during the period from sales of investments of $5.6 billion and principal repayments of $1.2 billion during 2014. Additionally, during 2014, we used cash of $774 million to acquire interests in a group of trusts collateralized by pools of seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans. During the year ended December 31, 2013 we generated cash from sales of RMBS investments of $1.2 billion and principal payments of $1.5 billion related to all our investment assets offset by purchases of $2.4 billion in RMBS securities.\nOur financing activities used cash of $2.5 billion, provided cash of $5.7 billion and used cash of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid proceeds on our repurchase agreements, net of proceeds received on our repurchase agreements of $1.0 billion. We also repaid principal of our securitized debt of $2.3 billion and paid dividends of $381 million. Additionally, during the second half of 2015, we also paid $250 million to repurchase common stock outstanding. These uses of cash were offset, in part, by receipt of cash on debt issuance of $1.5 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received proceeds on our repurchase agreements, net of repayments on our repurchase agreements of $6.8 billion and received proceeds from securitized debt borrowings of $392 million. These proceeds were offset by payments and repurchases on our securitized debt of $583 million and payments of dividends of $575 million. The payments of dividends during the year ended December 31, 2014 includes the $205 million of special dividends announced in the fourth quarter of 2013, but paid during the first quarter of 2014. The year ended December 31, 2013 reflected payments on securitized debt borrowings of $914 million, payment of dividends of $370 million and proceeds from repurchase agreements, net of payments on repurchase agreements, of $131 million.\nOur recourse leverage is 2.7:1 and 2.6:1 for the periods ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Our recourse leverage excludes the securitized debt which can only be repaid from the proceeds on the assets securing this debt in their respective VIEs. The decrease in our recourse leverage compared to September 30, 2014 is a result of the sale of higher leverage agency positions to acquire residential mortgage loans. Our recourse leverage is presented as a ratio of our repurchase agreements, which are recourse to the assets of the Company, to our economic net equity calculated as a part of our economic book value.\nWe believe that our cash balances provide an appropriate level of liquidity. Even though we have unrestricted Agency MBS investments, we expect to meet our future cash needs primarily from principal and interest payments on our portfolio and do not anticipate we will need to sell unrestricted Agency MBS investments to meet our liquidity needs. We expect to continue to finance our MBS portfolio largely through repurchase agreements and loans through the securitization market. In addition, we may from time to time sell securities or issue debt as a source of cash to fund new purchases.\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 the remaining maturities on our RMBS repurchase agreements were as follows.\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Overnight\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1 to 29 days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,312,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,652,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 30 to 59 days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,501,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,371,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 60 to 89 days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>246,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>656,915 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 90 to 119 days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,068,740 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Greater than or equal to 120 days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>947,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,705,153 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,439,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,455,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average days to maturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 77 Days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100 Days\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe collateralize the repurchase agreements we use to finance our operations with our MBS investments. Our counterparties negotiate a \u2018haircut' when we enter into a financing transaction, which varies from lender to lender. The size of the haircut reflects the perceived risk associated with holding the MBS by the lender. The haircut provides lenders with a cushion for daily market value movements that reduce the need for a margin call to be issued or margin to be returned as normal daily increases or decreases in MBS market values occur. At December 31, 2015, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 5.3% compared to a haircut on Agency MBS of 5.1% at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Non-Agency MBS was 32.9% compared to a haircut on Non-Agency MBS of 29.4% at December 31, 2014.\nAs the fair value of the Non-Agency MBS is more difficult to determine, as well as more volatile period to period than Agency MBS, the Non-Agency MBS typically requires a larger haircut. Repurchase agreements also subject us to two types of margin calls. First, there are monthly margin calls that are triggered as principal payments and pre-payments are received by us as these payments lower the value of the collateral. As a result, we expect to receive margin calls from our repurchase counterparties monthly simply due to the principal paydowns on our Agency RMBS. The monthly principal payments and pre-payments are not known in advance and vary depending on the behavior of the borrowers related to the underlying mortgages. Second, counterparties make margin calls or return margin as a result of normal daily increases or decreases in asset fair values. In addition, when financing assets using standard form of SIFMA Master Repurchase Agreements, the counterparty to the agreement typically nets its exposure to us on all outstanding repurchase agreements and issues margin calls if movement of the fair values of the assets in the aggregate exceeds their allowable exposure to us. A decline in asset fair values could create a margin call, or may create no margin call depending on the counterparty's specific policy. In addition, counterparties consider a number of factors, including their aggregate exposure to us as a whole and the number of days remaining before the repurchase transaction closes prior to issuing a margin call. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on how we determine the fair values of the RMBS collateralizing our repurchase agreements.\nThe table below presents our average daily repurchase balance and the repurchase balance at each period end for the periods presented. Our balance at period-end tends to fluctuate from the average daily balances due to the adjusting of the size of our portfolio by using leverage. Our average repurchase agreement balance for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to our average repurchase agreement balance for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to additional borrowings on our repurchase agreements in excess of repayments during 2015. We continue to deploy capital for strategic purchases of investments.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nRepurchase\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Repurchase\nBalance at Period\nEnd\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,404,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,439,339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,192,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,455,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,480,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,561,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Quarter End December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,404,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,439,339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Quarter End September 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,016,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,150,821 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Quarter End June 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,904,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,813,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Quarter End March 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,315,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,296,224 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are not required to maintain any specific debt-to-equity ratio. We believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality and risk of those assets. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 our total debt was approximately $11.7 billion and $13.6 billion which represented a debt-to-equity ratio for both periods of approximately 4.0:1 and 3.8:1, respectively. We include our repurchase agreements and securitized debt in the numerator of our debt-to-equity ratio and stockholders' equity as the denominator.\nDuring the year of 2015, we decreased our leverage as we sold portions of our Agency MBS portfolio to generate liquidity to settle repurchase agreements as well as to acquire a pool of mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015, we had repurchase agreements with 24 counterparties. All of our repurchase agreements are secured by Agency and Non-Agency RMBS or, in limited circumstances, cash. Under these repurchase agreements we may not be able to reclaim our collateral but still be obligated to pay our repurchase obligations. We mitigate this risk by limiting our exposure to any counterparty to approximately 10% or less of our total equity, as well as ensuring all our counterparties are highly rated. Therefore, we believe the risk of loss of our collateral posted is mitigated by the terms of our agreements. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $8.8 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively, of securities pledged against our repurchase agreement obligations.\nOur repurchase agreements have original maturities ranging from 30 to 956 days. The average days to maturity on our repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were 77 days and 100 days, respectively. We expect to renew each of our repurchase agreements at maturity. When we renew our repurchase agreements, there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain as favorable an interest rate as a result of rising rates. We offset the risk of our repurchase agreements primarily through the use of interest rate swaps. The average remaining maturities on our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2015 range from less than 1 year to 19 years and have a weighted average maturity of approximately 4 years. We use these interest rate swaps to protect the portfolio from short term changes in interest rates. We currently have three swap counterparties. When our interest rate swaps are in a net loss position (expected cash payments are in excess of expected cash receipts on the swaps), we post collateral as required by the terms of our swap agreements. As of December 31, 2015, we have posted $94 million of cash and securities as collateral to our swap counterparties.\nSecured Debt Financing Transactions\nDuring the year of 2015, we called securitized debt, collateralized by loans held for investment with an unpaid principal balance of $1.3 billion at par. This outstanding debt acquired is part of a securitization vehicle which has a call date in 2016. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued new debt, collateralized by these same loans held for investment, with an unpaid principal balance of $1.7 billion for $1.7 billion.\nExposure to European Financial Counterparties\nOur Agency RMBS are primarily financed with repurchase agreements. We secure our borrowings under these agreements by pledging our Agency RMBS as collateral to the lender. The collateral we pledge exceeds the amount of the borrowings under each agreement, typically with the extent of over-collateralization being at least 3% of the amount borrowed. If the counterparty to the repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations and we are not able to recover our pledged assets, we are at risk of losing the over-collateralized amount. The amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral.\nWe also use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risks. Under these swap agreements, we pledge Agency RMBS or cash as collateral as part of a margin arrangement for interest rate swaps that are in an unrealized loss position. If swap counterparty were to default on its obligation, we would be exposed to a loss to the extent that the amount of our Agency RMBS pledged exceeded the unrealized loss on the associated swaps and we were not able to recover the excess collateral.\nOver the past several years, several large European financial institutions have experienced financial difficulty and have been either rescued by government assistance or by other large European banks or institutions. Some of these financial institutions or their U.S. subsidiaries have provided us financing under repurchase agreements or we have entered into interest rate swaps with such institutions. We have entered into repurchase agreements or interest rate swaps with six counterparties as of December 31, 2015 that is either domiciled in Europe or is a U.S.-based subsidiary of a European-domiciled financial institution. The following table summarizes our exposure to such counterparties at December 31, 2015:\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Country\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Number of\nCounterparties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Repurchase\nAgreement\nFinancing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Interest Rate\nSwaps at Fair\nValue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Exposure (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Exposure as a\nPercentage of Total\nAssets\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> France\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>546,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(42,473 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.33% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Netherlands\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Switzerland\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,022,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,369 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>318,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.08% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United Kingdom\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.13% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,980,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(48,842 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>398,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.60% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Represents the amount of securities pledged as collateral to each counterparty less the aggregate of repurchase agreement financing and unrealized loss on swaps for each counterparty.\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, we did not use credit default swaps or other forms of credit protection to hedge the exposures summarized in the table above.\nIf the European credit crisis continues to impact these major European financial institutions, it is possible that it will also impact the operations of their U.S. subsidiaries. Our financings and operations could be adversely affected by such events. We monitor our exposure to our repurchase agreement and swap counterparties on a regular basis, using various methods, including review of recent rating agency actions, financial relief plans, credit spreads or other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements or the fair value of swaps with our counterparties. We make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements or interest rate swaps, or may try to take other actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when necessary.\nStockholders' Equity\nOther than as discussed below under Restricted Stock Grants,\u201d we did not issue any shares during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we declared dividends to common shareholders totaling $379 million, or $1.92 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we declared dividends to common shareholders totaling $370 million, or $1.80 per share.\nWe had no preferred stock issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Management Agreement\nAs discussed above, on August 5, 2015, we entered into agreements to internalize our management. Prior to the Internalization, we were managed by FIDAC pursuant to the Management Agreement (the Management Agreement\u201d). In connection with the Internalization, we terminated the Management Agreement without the payment of any termination fee.\nThe Management Agreement provided that FIDAC would pay all past and future expenses that the Company or our Audit Committee incur to: (1) evaluate the Company's accounting policy related to the application of GAAP to its Non-Agency RMBS portfolio (the Evaluation\u201d); (2) restate the financial statements for the period covering 2008 through 2011 as a result of the Evaluation (the Restatement Filing\u201d); and (3) investigate and evaluate any shareholder derivative demands arising from the Evaluation or the Restatement Filing (the Investigation\u201d); provided, however, that the Manager's obligation to pay expenses applies only to expenses not paid by our insurers under our insurance policies. Expenses shall include, without limitation, fees and costs incurred with respect to auditors, outside counsel, and consultants engaged by us or our Audit Committee for the Evaluation, Restatement Filing and the Investigation. The amount paid by the Manager related to these expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is $7 million and $9 million, respectively. Recoveries are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as Expense recoveries from Manager.\nRestricted Stock Grants\nWe granted 260,200 shares of restricted stock to employees of FIDAC and its affiliates and members of our Board of Directors on January 2, 2008. On February 2, 2015 we granted 84,700 shares of restricted stock to employees of FIDAC. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were approximately 71,000 and 39,400 unvested shares of restricted stock issued to our employees, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following tables summarize our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The estimated principal repayment schedule of the securitized debt is based on expected cash flows of the residential mortgage loans or RMBS, as adjusted for expected principal writedowns on the underlying collateral of the debt.\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Within One Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One to Three\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three to Five\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Greater Than\nor Equal to\nFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements for RMBS\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,180,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,439,337 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securitized debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>735,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,125,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>817,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,567,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,247,113 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on RMBS repurchase agreements (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,073 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on securitized debt (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>218,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>547,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,189,533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,094,977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,655,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,036,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,115,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,903,056 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Interest is based on variable rates in effect as of December 31, 2015.\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Within One Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One to Three\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three to Five\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Greater Than\nor Equal to\nFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements for RMBS\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,155,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,455,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securitized debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>880,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,427,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>940,975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,645,706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,894,284 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on RMBS repurchase agreements (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,454 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on securitized debt (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>313,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>573,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,309,741 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,238,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,040,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,179,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,219,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,677,860 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Interest is based on variable rates in effect as of December 31, 2014.\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities.\nCapital Expenditure Requirements\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nDividends\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income (subject to certain adjustments). We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Before we pay any dividend, we must first meet any operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our financing facilities and other debt payable.\nInflation\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions will be determined by our Board of Directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to maintain our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and financial condition are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation.\nOther Matters\nWe have organized ourselves as a holding company and conduct our real estate businesses primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries and at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. If we were to become regulated as an investment company, our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced.\nSection 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer's total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (the 40% test\u201d). Excluded from the term investment securities,\u201d among other things, are securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that rely on the exemptions from registration other than Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, such as the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.\nCertain of our subsidiaries, including Chimera RMBS Whole Pool, LLC (f/k/a Chimera Asset Holding LLC) and certain subsidiaries that we may form in the future, rely on the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or the SEC), requires us to invest at least 55% of our assets in mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate\u201d (or Qualifying Real Estate Assets) and at least 80% of our assets in Qualifying Real Estate Assets plus real estate related assets. The assets that we acquire, therefore, are limited by the provisions of and the rules and regulations promulgated under the Investment Company Act.\nWe also have formed, and may in the future form, certain other wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that rely upon the exclusion from the definition of investment company under the Investment Company Act provided by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. The securities issued by any wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiary that relies on the exclusion from the definition of investment company provided by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7), together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis. We monitor our compliance with the 40% Test and the operations of our subsidiaries so that we and each of our subsidiaries may maintain compliance with an exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nOn August 31, 2011, the SEC issued a concept release titled Companies Engaged in the Business of Acquiring Mortgages and Mortgage-Related Instruments\u201d (SEC Release No. IC-29778). Under the concept release, the SEC is reviewing interpretive issues related to the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exemption. We will continue to monitor developments related to this matter.\nBased on our calculations, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) and 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act.\nAs a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, gained jurisdiction over the regulation of interest rate swaps. The CFTC has asserted that this causes the operators of mortgage real estate investment trusts that use swaps as part of their business model to fall within the statutory definition of Commodity Pool Operator, or CPO, and, absent relief from the Division or the Commission, to register as CPOs. On December 7, 2012, as a result of numerous requests for no-action relief from the CPO registration requirement for operators of mortgage real estate investment trusts, the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight of the CFTC issued no-action relief entitled No-Action Relief from the Commodity Pool Operator Registration Requirement for Commodity Pool Operators of Certain Pooled Investment Vehicles Organized as Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts\u201d that permits a CPO to receive relief by filing a claim to perfect the use of the relief. A claim submitted by a CPO will be effective upon filing, so long as the claim is materially complete. The conditions that must be met to claim the relief are that the mortgage real estate investment trust must:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Limit the initial margin and premiums required to establish its commodity interest positions to no more than five percent of the fair market value of the mortgage real estate investment trust's total assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Limit the net income derived annually from its commodity interest positions that are not qualifying hedging transactions to less than five percent of the mortgage real estate investment trust's gross income;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Ensure that interests in the mortgage real estate investment trust are not marketed to the public as or in a commodity pool or otherwise as or in a vehicle for trading in the commodity futures, commodity options, or swaps markets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Either:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> o\n</td> <td> identify itself as a mortgage REIT\u201d in Item G of its last U.S. income tax return on Form 1120-REIT; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> o\n</td> <td> if it has not yet filed its first U.S. income tax return on Form 1120-REIT, disclose to its shareholders that it intends to identify itself as a mortgage REIT\u201d in its first U.S. income tax return on Form 1120-REIT.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we disagree that the CFTC's position that mortgage real estate investment trusts that use swaps as part of their business model fall within the statutory definition of a CPO, we have submitted a claim for the relief set forth in the no-action relief entitled No-Action Relief from the Commodity Pool Operator Registration Requirement for Commodity Pool Operators of Certain Pooled Investment Vehicles Organized as Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts\u201d and believe we meet the criteria for such relief set forth therein.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAccounting policies are integral to understanding our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions, on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements. Our significant accounting policies and accounting estimates are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies are described in this section. An accounting policy is considered critical if it requires management to make assumptions or judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made or require significant management judgment in interpreting the accounting literature. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, or other accounting judgments were made, this could have a significant and potentially adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These critical accounting policies were developed by management, and reviewed by our auditors, prior to being presented to and discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe consolidated financial statements include, on a consolidated basis, our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities, or VIEs, for which we are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including OTTI of Non-Agency RMBS, valuation of Agency and Non-Agency RMBS and interest rate swaps and income recognition on Non-Agency RMBS. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nInterest Income and Impairment on Non-Agency and Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities\nWe invest in RMBS representing interests in obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans. We delineate between (1) Agency RMBS and (2) Non-Agency RMBS as follows: The Agency RMBS are mortgage pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs\u201d), and other RMBS representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans issued or guaranteed as to principal and/or interest repayment by agencies of the U.S. Government or federally chartered corporations such as Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The Non-Agency RMBS are not issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae and are therefore subject to credit risk.\nWe hold our RMBS as available-for-sale, record these investments at estimated fair value as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, and include unrealized gains and losses considered to be temporary in Other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. From time to time, as part of the overall management of our portfolio, we may sell any of our RMBS investments and recognize a realized gain or loss as a component of earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income utilizing the specific identification method.\nOur accounting policies for recognition of interest income and OTTI related to RMBS are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As noted therein, there are three different accounting models that may be applicable for purposes of the recognition of interest income and OTTI on RMBS, and include the following:\nASC 310-20, Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (ASC 310-20) - applies to all Agency RMBS and certain Non-Agency RMBS of high credit quality that, at the time of purchase, we expect to collect all contractual cash flows and the security cannot be contractually prepaid in such a way that we would not recover substantially all of our recorded investment.\nASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (ASC 310-30) - applies to Non-Agency RMBS where there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality and we do not expect to collect all contractual cash flows of the security.\nASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (ASC 325-40) - applies to certain Non-Agency RMBS not within the scope of ASC 310-20 or ASC 310-30. These include Non-Agency RMBS which is not of high credit quality at the time of purchase or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that we would not recover substantially all of our recorded investment.\nThe determination of which accounting model to apply will have a significant impact on the amounts of interest income and OTTI losses reflected in the results of operations because each accounting model has different requirements regarding the cash flows used to calculate interest income and impairments (i.e., contractual cash flows vs. expected cash flows) and the manner of such calculations, and the impact of changes in prepayment assumptions on interest income or OTTI losses.\nFor Agency and Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20, the amount of interest income recorded over the life of a security will be equal to the contractual cash flows of the security and the accretion/amortization of any purchase discount or premium. The amount of interest income reported in any particular financial reporting period will, however, vary depending on the actual and estimated prepayments on the security. For Agency RMBS purchased at a premium to the principal amount, increases in prepayment speeds will generally result in a reduction of the recorded amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period whereas decreases in prepayment speeds will generally result in an increase in the amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period. The opposite is generally the case for Agency RMBS purchased at a discount to the principal amount. That is, as prepayment speeds increase, interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally increase, whereas interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally decrease when prepayment speeds decline. However, volatility in the reported amount of interest income will result when there are significant changes in actual or future expected prepayment speeds regardless of the direction of those changes. This volatility is because the accounting model that we apply under ASC 310-20 requires us to record a cumulative adjustment, on a retrospective basis from the acquisition date of the security, when there are changes in prepayment speeds. That cumulative adjustment at each reporting date is intended to reflect the most current estimate of the timing of prepayments over the life of the security (both actual prepayments that have occurred in the past and the timing of prepayments that will occur in the future).\nAgency RMBS and Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20 may experience an OTTI loss. The OTTI loss recognized in earnings will be calculated based on the present value of the contractual cash flows expected to be collected. Subsequent to recognition of an OTTI loss, we recognize income on these securities under ASC 310-30 as further described below.\nFor Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40, the reported amounts of interest income and OTTI are significantly impacted by management judgments around both the amount and timing of credit losses (defaults) and prepayments. Interest income on these Non-Agency RMBS is recognized initially and in subsequent periods based on the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected, as opposed to being based on contractual cash flows. The accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 do not provide for delineations between individual changes in cash flow estimates based on expected defaults or prepayments. Accordingly, we are required to consider the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments to determine the amount of interest income to recognize. Furthermore, the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments also impacts the amount of OTTI losses recognized in earnings.\nNon-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40 is generally purchased at a discount to the principal amount. At the original acquisition date, we estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected and calibrate the present value of those amounts to our purchase price. In each subsequent financial reporting period, we are required to revise our estimates of the remaining timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Depending on the nature of the changes in the timing or amount of cash flows expected to be collected, whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayment assumptions, the following will occur:\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> If there is a positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, the effective interest rate in future accounting periods may increase resulting in an increase in the reported amount of interest income in future periods. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes must be considered significant for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 for the effective interest rate in future accounting periods to increase. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has increased from the previous estimate. This can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from reductions in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, a positive change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the positive impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the negative impact of increased defaults, or when the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults exceeds the negative impact of an extension of the timing of receipt of cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> If there is a negative (or adverse) change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, and the securities' fair value is below its amortized cost, an OTTI loss equal to the adverse change in cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the securities' effective rate before impairment, is required to be recorded in current period earnings. For Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in future periods will decline because of the reduced balance of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied. Additionally, for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 325-40, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income during the period directly after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in such future period will decline, absent an increase in cash flows expected to be collected, because of the reduced amount of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied. An adverse change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has decreased from the most previous estimate. This change can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from increases in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, an adverse change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the negative impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults, or when the negative impact of an increase in estimated defaults exceeds the positive impact of a shortening of the timing of receipt of cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 are impacted by both assumptions of prepayments and assumptions of credit losses (defaults) and, accordingly, changes in the amounts of recorded interest income or OTTI losses over financial reporting periods cannot be considered to result solely from the impact of changes in the credit profile of the investment or solely from the impact of changes in prepayment speeds. Furthermore, while there may be some level of correlation between assumptions for defaults and prepayments as general market interest rates change, in the recent market conditions that correlation has not been direct or predictable.\nDetermination of appropriate accounting model for Non-Agency RMBS\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the determination of the appropriate accounting model for Non-Agency RMBS is dependent on management's assessment and judgment related to the following factors made as of the acquisition date:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Our assessment of the credit quality of the asset, including its credit rating at the acquisition date and whether the security has experienced deterioration in credit quality since its inception.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Our assessment of the probability of collection of all contractual cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Our assessment of whether the security can be contractually prepaid such that we would not recover our initial investment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe most critical judgment inherent in the determination of the appropriate accounting model is our assessment of the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date. In making this accounting judgment, we consider expected defaults and prepayments as further described below.\nImpact of prepayment assumptions on RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20\nChanges in actual prepayments will impact the amount of interest income recognized in each financial reporting period for RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20. We estimate expected prepayment as further described below.\nImpact of default and prepayment assumptions on Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40\nIn determining the OTTI related to credit losses for Non-Agency RMBS securities accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40, we compare the present value of the remaining cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date (or last date previously revised) against the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected at the current financial reporting date. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows is the effective interest rate or effective yield used for income recognition purposes.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors (i) do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and/or (ii) do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The entity that consolidates a VIE is known as its primary beneficiary, and is generally the entity with (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and (ii) the right to receive benefits from the VIE or the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. For VIEs' that do not have substantial on-going activities, the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance may be determined by an entity's involvement with the design of the VIE.\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition contain the assets and liabilities related to seventeen consolidated variable interest entities, or VIEs. Due to the non-recourse nature of these VIEs our net exposure to loss from investments in these entities is limited to our retained beneficial interests.\nWe currently consolidate twelve residential mortgage loan securitizations and five RMBS re-securitization transactions which are VIEs. The residential mortgage loan securitizations contain jumbo prime residential mortgage loans we purchased during 2007 and 2008 and securitized shortly thereafter. The RMBS re-securitization transactions contain Non-Agency RMBS comprised of primarily what we classify as collateral backed by Alt-A first lien mortgages of 2005-2007 vintages. We categorize collateral as Alt-A regardless of whether the loans were originally described as prime\u201d if the behavior of the collateral when we purchased the security more resembles typical Alt-A collateral. We define Alt-A collateral characteristics to be evidenced by the 60+ day delinquency bucket of the pool being greater than 5% and the weighted average FICO scores at the time of origination as greater than 650.\nOur determination to consolidate these seventeen VIEs was significantly influenced by management's judgment related to the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities and the identification of the party with the power over such activities. For the residential mortgage loan securitizations, we determined that our ability to replace defaulting loans with performing loans resulted in us having the power that most significantly impacts the economic performance of the VIE. For the five consolidated RMBS re-securitization transactions, we determined that no party has power over any ongoing activities of the entities and therefore the determination of the primary beneficiary should be based on involvement with the initial design of the entity. Since we transferred the RMBS to the securitization entities, we determined we had the power over the design of the entity, which resulted in us being considered the primary beneficiary. This determination was influenced by the amount of economic exposure to the financial performance of the entity and required a significant management judgment in determining that we should consolidate these five entities.\nDue to the consolidation of these VIEs, our actual ownership interests in the securitization and re-securitizations have been eliminated in consolidation and the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition reflect both the assets held and non-recourse debt issued to third parties by these VIEs. In addition, our operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts related to the assets and liabilities of the VIEs as opposed to the actual economic interests we own in these VIEs. Our interest in these VIEs is restricted to the beneficial interests we retained in these transactions. We are not obligated to provide any financial support to these VIEs.\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition separately present: (i) our direct assets and liabilities, and (ii) the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization vehicles. Assets of all consolidated VIEs can only be used to satisfy the obligations of those VIEs, and the liabilities of consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to us.\nWe have aggregated all the assets and liabilities of the consolidated securitization vehicles due to our determination that these entities are substantively similar and therefore a further disaggregated presentation would not be more meaningful. The notes to our consolidated financial statements describe our direct assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization vehicles. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our investments in VIEs.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements under GAAP. Specifically, this guidance defines fair value based on exit price, or the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques for RMBS are based on models that consider the estimated cash flows expected to be collected from the underlying collateral and an estimated market-based yield reflective of the unique attributes of the tranche including, but not limited to, assumptions related to prepayment speeds, the frequency and severity of defaults and attributes of the collateral underlying such securities. Estimates of the fair value of RMBS are particularly sensitive to assumptions related to the expected timing of prepayments, the extent of defaults, and the severity of expected losses. Management reviews the fair values generated by the model to determine whether prices are reflective of the current market. Management indirectly corroborates its estimates of the fair value using pricing models by comparing its results to independent prices provided by third party pricing services.\nTo the extent the inputs used to estimate fair value are observable, the values would be categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; otherwise they would be categorized as Level 3. The Company's fair value estimation process utilizes inputs other than quoted prices that are observed in the market. The Company's estimate of prepayment, default and severity curves all involve adjustments that are deemed to be significant to the fair value measurement process, which renders the resulting Non-Agency fair value estimates Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 assets represent approximately 55% and 49% of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Level 3 liabilities represent approximately 88% and 97%of total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. None of the liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 are Level 3.\nOur assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value are discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2(p) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of accounting guidance recently adopted by the Company or expected to be adopted by the Company in the future.", "item_7_truncated": "\nOur interest rate swaps are primarily used to economically hedge the effects of changes in interest rates on our portfolio specifically our floating rate debt. Therefore, we included the periodic interest costs of the interest rate swaps for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 on these economic hedges in our presentation of economic net interest income and our net interest spreads. As we do not account for these as hedges for GAAP presentation, we present these gains and losses separately in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The increase in the net periodic interest cost of the interest rate swaps are primarily due to declines in interest rates year over year as we pay a fixed rate on our interest rate swaps and are receiving a lower floating rate.\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Overnight\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1 to 29 days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,312,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,652,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 30 to 59 days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,501,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,371,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 60 to 89 days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>246,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>656,915 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 90 to 119 days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,068,740 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Greater than or equal to 120 days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>947,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,705,153 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,439,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,455,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average days to maturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 77 Days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100 Days\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Core earnings for the year was $472 million or $2.37 per average basic common share, compared to $441 million or $2.14 per average basic common share.

Our income is generated primarily by the difference, or net spread, between the income we earn on our assets and the cost of our borrowings. We expect to finance our investments using a variety of financing sources including, when available, repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities and securitizations. We may manage our debt and interest rate risk by utilizing interest rate hedges, such as interest rate swaps, caps, options and futures to reduce the effect of interest rate fluctuations related to our financing sources.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Quarters Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> September 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> June 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> March 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Accretable Discount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, beginning of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,003,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,035,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>990,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>987,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>977,042 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(43,520 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,498 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,302 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,350 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,165 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and deconsolidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,144 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,645 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,458 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,147 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,977 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transfers from/(to) credit reserve, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,744 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,325 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>954,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,003,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,035,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>990,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>987,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur repurchase agreements have original maturities ranging from 30 to 956 days. The average days to maturity on our repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were 77 days and 100 days, respectively. We expect to renew each of our repurchase agreements at maturity. When we renew our repurchase agreements, there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain as favorable an interest rate as a result of rising rates. We offset the risk of our repurchase agreements primarily through the use of interest rate swaps. The average remaining maturities on our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2015 range from less than 1 year to 19 years and have a weighted average maturity of approximately 4 years. We use these interest rate swaps to protect the portfolio from short term changes in interest rates. We currently have three swap counterparties. When our interest rate swaps are in a net loss position (expected cash payments are in excess of expected cash receipts on the swaps), we post collateral as required by the terms of our swap agreements. As of December 31, 2015, we have posted $94 million of cash and securities as collateral to our swap counterparties.\nFor Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40, the reported amounts of interest income and OTTI are significantly impacted by management judgments around both the amount and timing of credit losses (defaults) and prepayments. Interest income on these Non-Agency RMBS is recognized initially and in subsequent periods based on the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected, as opposed to being based on contractual cash flows. The accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 do not provide for delineations between individual changes in cash flow estimates based on expected defaults or prepayments. Accordingly, we are required to consider the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments to determine the amount of interest income to recognize. Furthermore, the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments also impacts the amount of OTTI losses recognized in earnings.\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

As we identify opportunities in the mortgage backed securities market, we may from time to time purchase or sell mortgage options, including both call and put options to take advantage of these opportunities.

Our net interest rate spread, which equals the yield on our average assets less the economic average cost of funds decreased by approximately 90 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. The net interest margin, which equals the net economic interest income as a percentage of the net average balance of our interest-earning assets less our interest-bearing liabilities, decreased by 100 basis for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. Average earning assets increased by $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the same period of the prior year, primarily as a result of the increase in subprime residential mortgage loans held for investment. Our net interest margin declined due to a decline in the total average yield on our interest-earning assets which was not fully offset by the decline in our average cost of funds. The portfolio has experienced several changes from the same period for the prior year as we have increased our average Agency RMBS and seasoned sub-prime securitized loans held for investment and our jumbo prime securitized loans have declined as a percentage of the total portfolio. These changes have increased our leverage, resulting in lower net interest rate spreads, but higher total interest income.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average

The entity that consolidates a VIE is known as its primary beneficiary, and is generally the entity with (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and (ii) the right to receive benefits from the VIE or the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. For VIEs' that do not have substantial on-going activities, the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance may be determined by an entity's involvement with the design of the VIE.\nThe calculation of estimated economic book value described above is used by management to understand the fair value of the assets we own and the liabilities for which we are legally obligated, and is presented for informational use only. The estimated economic book value should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for book value computed in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have aggregated all the assets and liabilities of the consolidated securitization vehicles due to our determination that these entities are substantively similar and therefore a further disaggregated presentation would not be more meaningful.

When the Company acquires its outstanding debt, it extinguishes the outstanding debt and recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the carrying value of the debt and the cost to acquire the debt which is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income as a loss on extinguishment of debt during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n\nIf the European credit crisis continues to impact these major European financial institutions, it is possible that it will also impact the operations of their U.S. subsidiaries. Our financings and operations could be adversely affected by such events. We monitor our exposure to our repurchase agreement and swap counterparties on a regular basis, using various methods, including review of recent rating agency actions, financial relief plans, credit spreads or other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements or the fair value of swaps with our counterparties. We make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements or interest rate swaps, or may try to take other actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when necessary.\nOur recourse leverage is 2.7:1 and 2.6:1 for the periods ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Our recourse leverage excludes the securitized debt which can only be repaid from the proceeds on the assets securing this debt in their respective VIEs. The decrease in our recourse leverage compared to September 30, 2014 is a result of the sale of higher leverage agency positions to acquire residential mortgage loans. Our recourse leverage is presented as a ratio of our repurchase agreements, which are recourse to the assets of the Company, to our economic net equity calculated as a part of our economic book value.\nImpact of default and prepayment assumptions on Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> GAAP\nInterest\nIncome\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> GAAP\nInterest\nExpense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Add: Net\nRealized\nLosses on\nInterest Rate\nSwaps\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Economic\nInterest\nExpense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> GAAP Net\nInterest\nIncome\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less: Net\nRealized\nLosses on\nInterest Rate\nSwaps\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Economic\nNet\nInterest\nIncome (1)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>872,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>257,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>304,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>615,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>567,361 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>687,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>540,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>487,466 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For the Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>511,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>409,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>387,957 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For the Quarter Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>201,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,272 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For the Quarter Ended September 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>146,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,714 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For the Quarter Ended June 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>215,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,173 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For the Quarter Ended March 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,202 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Excludes interest income on cash and cash equivalents.\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have elected the fair value option with changes in fair value reflected in earnings for our Agency and Non-Agency IO RMBS securities, securitized loans held for investment and the related financing for the securitized loans consolidated as a VIE in our statement of financial condition.

Excluded from the term investment securities,\u201d among other things, are securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that rely on the exemptions from registration other than Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, such as the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.\n \u00b7 Ensure that interests in the mortgage real estate investment trust are not marketed to the public as or in a commodity pool or otherwise as or in a vehicle for trading in the commodity futures, commodity options, or swaps markets; and \nWe make investment decisions based on various factors, including expected cash yield, relative value, risk-adjusted returns, current and projected credit fundamentals, current and projected macroeconomic considerations, current and projected supply and demand, credit and market risk concentration limits, liquidity, cost of financing and financing availability, as well as maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act.\nOn August 5, 2015, as discussed above under The Internalization,\u201d we announced the mutual agreement to terminate the Management Agreement between us and our Manager, effective immediately. Thus, as of August 5, 2015, we began incurring compensation expense as we are now internally managed (whereas prior to the Internalization, such expenses were incurred by our Manager, and we paid a management fee). The table below shows our total management fee and general and administrative, or G&A, expenses, compensation and benefit expense and deal expenses as compared to average total assets and average equity for the periods presented.\nAs the fair value of the Non-Agency MBS is more difficult to determine, as well as more volatile period to period than Agency MBS, the Non-Agency MBS typically requires a larger haircut. Repurchase agreements also subject us to two types of margin calls. First, there are monthly margin calls that are triggered as principal payments and pre-payments are received by us as these payments lower the value of the collateral. As a result, we expect to receive margin calls from our repurchase counterparties monthly simply due to the principal paydowns on our Agency RMBS. The monthly principal payments and pre-payments are not known in advance and vary depending on the behavior of the borrowers related to the underlying mortgages. Second, counterparties make margin calls or return margin as a result of normal daily increases or decreases in asset fair values. In addition, when financing assets using standard form of SIFMA Master Repurchase Agreements, the counterparty to the agreement typically nets its exposure to us on all outstanding repurchase agreements and issues margin calls if movement of the fair values of the assets in the aggregate exceeds their allowable exposure to us. A decline in asset fair values could create a margin call, or may create no margin call depending on the counterparty's specific policy. In addition, counterparties consider a number of factors, including their aggregate exposure to us as a whole and the number of days remaining before the repurchase transaction closes prior to issuing a margin call. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on how we determine the fair values of the RMBS collateralizing our repurchase agreements.\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Quarters Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> September 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> June 30, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> March 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Non-Accretable Difference\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, beginning of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>879,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,001,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>947,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>908,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>933,668 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal Writedowns\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,064 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,587 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34,261 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,955 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37,044 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and deconsolidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,347 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(94,802 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(709 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,041 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net other-than-temporary credit impairment losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,992 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transfers to/(from) credit reserve, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,882 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,842 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59,026 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54,325 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>837,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>879,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,001,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>947,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>908,927 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 31, 2011, the SEC issued a concept release titled Companies Engaged in the Business of Acquiring Mortgages and Mortgage-Related Instruments\u201d (SEC Release No. IC-29778). Under the concept release, the SEC is reviewing interpretive issues related to the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exemption. We will continue to monitor developments related to this matter.\nOur determination to consolidate these seventeen VIEs was significantly influenced by management's judgment related to the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities and the identification of the party with the power over such activities. For the residential mortgage loan securitizations, we determined that our ability to replace defaulting loans with performing loans resulted in us having the power that most significantly impacts the economic performance of the VIE. For the five consolidated RMBS re-securitization transactions, we determined that no party has power over any ongoing activities of the entities and therefore the determination of the primary beneficiary should be based on involvement with the initial design of the entity. Since we transferred the RMBS to the securitization entities, we determined we had the power over the design of the entity, which resulted in us being considered the primary beneficiary. This determination was influenced by the amount of economic exposure to the financial performance of the entity and required a significant management judgment in determining that we should consolidate these five entities.\nResults of Operations for the years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments at Fair Value\nIn August 2015, we announced a $250 million stock buyback plan. Immediately following the announcement, we entered into a share repurchase agreement with Annaly to acquire the 9 million shares owned by Annaly. We used the remaining amount available after the purchase of shared owned by Annaly to purchase shares in the open market during the third and fourth quarter of 2015. The stock buyback reduced shares outstanding by 18 million shares or 9% of shares outstanding prior to the buyback. On February 18, 2016, the Board of Directors increased the existing share buyback program by $100 million to $350 million.\nNet other-than-temporary credit impairment losses\nOur net income increased by $226 million to $589 million, or $2.87 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $363 million, or $1.77 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 over the same period of 2013 is primarily attributable to higher interest income, net of interest expense, of $130 million, to $540 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $410 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase in net interest income is due to the increase in invested assets from the acquisition of additional Agency RMBS and securitized loans held for investment. In addition to the increase in net interest income, we recognized gains as a result of changes in fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value of $238 million. The Company recognized a gain of $194 million in fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a loss of $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This gain from increase in fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value was offset by net unrealized losses on derivatives as a result of changes in fair value on derivatives of $138 million. The Company recognized net unrealized losses on derivatives of $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a gain of $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nWe currently consolidate twelve residential mortgage loan securitizations and five RMBS re-securitization transactions which are VIEs. The residential mortgage loan securitizations contain jumbo prime residential mortgage loans we purchased during 2007 and 2008 and securitized shortly thereafter. The RMBS re-securitization transactions contain Non-Agency RMBS comprised of primarily what we classify as collateral backed by Alt-A first lien mortgages of 2005-2007 vintages. We categorize collateral as Alt-A regardless of whether the loans were originally described as prime\u201d if the behavior of the collateral when we purchased the security more resembles typical Alt-A collateral. We define Alt-A collateral characteristics to be evidenced by the 60+ day delinquency bucket of the pool being greater than 5% and the weighted average FICO scores at the time of origination as greater than 650.\nAgency RMBS and Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20 may experience an OTTI loss. The OTTI loss recognized in earnings will be calculated based on the present value of the contractual cash flows expected to be collected. Subsequent to recognition of an OTTI loss, we recognize income on these securities under ASC 310-30 as further described below.\n\nFor Agency and Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20, the amount of interest income recorded over the life of a security will be equal to the contractual cash flows of the security and the accretion/amortization of any purchase discount or premium. The amount of interest income reported in any particular financial reporting period will, however, vary depending on the actual and estimated prepayments on the security. For Agency RMBS purchased at a premium to the principal amount, increases in prepayment speeds will generally result in a reduction of the recorded amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period whereas decreases in prepayment speeds will generally result in an increase in the amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period. The opposite is generally the case for Agency RMBS purchased at a discount to the principal amount. That is, as prepayment speeds increase, interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally increase, whereas interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally decrease when prepayment speeds decline. However, volatility in the reported amount of interest income will result when there are significant changes in actual or future expected prepayment speeds regardless of the direction of those changes. This volatility is because the accounting model that we apply under ASC 310-20 requires us to record a cumulative adjustment, on a retrospective basis from the acquisition date of the security, when there are changes in prepayment speeds. That cumulative adjustment at each reporting date is intended to reflect the most current estimate of the timing of prepayments over the life of the security (both actual prepayments that have occurred in the past and the timing of prepayments that will occur in the future).\nCertain of our subsidiaries, including Chimera RMBS Whole Pool, LLC (f/k/a Chimera Asset Holding LLC) and certain subsidiaries that we may form in the future, rely on the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or the SEC), requires us to invest at least 55% of our assets in mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate\u201d (or Qualifying Real Estate Assets) and at least 80% of our assets in Qualifying Real Estate Assets plus real estate related assets. The assets that we acquire, therefore, are limited by the provisions of and the rules and regulations promulgated under the Investment Company Act.\nIn addition, during the third quarter of 2014, we received a reimbursement of prior management fees paid to FIDAC of $24 million which did not recur in 2015.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u00b7 Either: \nEconomic Interest Expense and the Cost of Funds\nServicing Fees\nStock Buy Back\nLooking forward, we cannot predict the percentage of our assets that will be invested in each asset class or whether we will invest in other classes of investments. We may change our investment strategy and policies without a vote of our stockholders.\nThe Management Agreement\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including OTTI of Non-Agency RMBS, valuation of Agency and Non-Agency RMBS and interest rate swaps and income recognition on Non-Agency RMBS. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nIn addition to the principal sources of capital described above, we may enter into warehouse facilities and use longer dated structured repurchase agreements. The use of any particular source of capital and funds will depend on market conditions, availability of these facilities, and the investment opportunities available to us.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements under GAAP. Specifically, this guidance defines fair value based on exit price, or the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques for RMBS are based on models that consider the estimated cash flows expected to be collected from the underlying collateral and an estimated market-based yield reflective of the unique attributes of the tranche including, but not limited to, assumptions related to prepayment speeds, the frequency and severity of defaults and attributes of the collateral underlying such securities. Estimates of the fair value of RMBS are particularly sensitive to assumptions related to the expected timing of prepayments, the extent of defaults, and the severity of expected losses. Management reviews the fair values generated by the model to determine whether prices are reflective of the current market. Management indirectly corroborates its estimates of the fair value using pricing models by comparing its results to independent prices provided by third party pricing services.\n \u00b7 Limit the net income derived annually from its commodity interest positions that are not qualifying hedging transactions to less than five percent of the mortgage real estate investment trust's gross income; \nWe operate our business to be exempt from registration under the 1940 Act, and therefore we are required to invest a substantial majority of our assets in loans secured by mortgages on real estate and real estate-related assets. Subject to maintaining our REIT qualification and our 1940 Act exemption, we do not have any limitations on the amounts we may invest in any of our targeted asset classes.\nThe following table summarizes certain characteristics of our portfolio at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nWe also expect to meet our short term liquidity needs by relying on the cash flows generated by our investments. These cash flows are primarily comprised of monthly principal and interest payments received on our investments. We may also sell our investments and utilize those proceeds to meet our short term liquidity needs or enter into non-recourse financing of our assets through sales of securities to third parties of loan securitizations or RMBS re-securitization transactions, similar to transactions that we have completed in prior periods.\n\nThe Management Agreement provided that FIDAC would pay all past and future expenses that the Company or our Audit Committee incur to: (1) evaluate the Company's accounting policy related to the application of GAAP to its Non-Agency RMBS portfolio (the Evaluation\u201d); (2) restate the financial statements for the period covering 2008 through 2011 as a result of the Evaluation (the Restatement Filing\u201d); and (3) investigate and evaluate any shareholder derivative demands arising from the Evaluation or the Restatement Filing (the Investigation\u201d); provided, however, that the Manager's obligation to pay expenses applies only to expenses not paid by our insurers under our insurance policies. Expenses shall include, without limitation, fees and costs incurred with respect to auditors, outside counsel, and consultants engaged by us or our Audit Committee for the Evaluation, Restatement Filing and the Investigation. The amount paid by the Manager related to these expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is $7 million and $9 million, respectively. Recoveries are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as Expense recoveries from Manager.\nGeneral\nUnrealized gains and losses on our Agency and Non-Agency RMBS portfolio represent the changes in fair values of the securities from the prior period. Unrealized gains and losses on our entire Agency and Non-Agency RMBS portfolio are reflected in earnings. IO securities represent the right to receive the interest on a pool of mortgage backed securities, including both Agency and Non-Agency mortgage pools. The fair value of IO RMBS securities are heavily impacted by changes in expected prepayment rates. When IO securities prepay, the holder of the IO security will receive less interest on the investment due to the reduced principal. During the second quarter of 2015, we acquired residual interests in several seasoned pools of mortgage loans. These holdings generally do not have a traditional unpaid principal amount and pay cash based on guidance in the trust documents when excess cash is available. Many of these holdings do not pay any interest and may never pay interest. We have elected to carry these residual interests at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. As of January 1, 2015, the Company adopted the guidance in ASU 2014-13, Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity, which allowed us to carry both the assets and liabilities of certain consolidated VIEs at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.\nManagement Fees, Compensation, General and Administrative Expenses and Deal Expenses\nAt December 31, 2015, the difference between GAAP book value and estimated economic book value was $196 million, or $1.05 per share. At December 31, 2014, the difference between GAAP book value and estimated economic book value was $336 million, or $1.65 per share. This difference is primarily driven by the value of the RMBS assets we have retained in these re-securitization transactions as compared to the value of consolidated loans and securities net of RMBS assets sold, but treated as a secured financing on the statement of financial condition. In these re-securitization transactions, we have generally retained the subordinated, typically non-rated, first loss notes or certificates issued by the securitization trusts. These securities are complex, typically locked out as to principal repayment, relatively illiquid, and do not necessarily appreciate or depreciate in tandem with the broader Non-Agency RMBS market or with the loans on securities owned by the trusts. As the senior notes pay off, we expect the difference between our economic and our GAAP book value to decrease. The tables below present the adjustments to GAAP book value that we believe are necessary to adequately reflect our calculation of estimated economic book value as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 are impacted by both assumptions of prepayments and assumptions of credit losses (defaults) and, accordingly, changes in the amounts of recorded interest income or OTTI losses over financial reporting periods cannot be considered to result solely from the impact of changes in the credit profile of the investment or solely from the impact of changes in prepayment speeds. Furthermore, while there may be some level of correlation between assumptions for defaults and prepayments as general market interest rates change, in the recent market conditions that correlation has not been direct or predictable.\nThe most critical judgment inherent in the determination of the appropriate accounting model is our assessment of the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date. In making this accounting judgment, we consider expected defaults and prepayments as further described below.\nExecutive Summary\nInterest expense increased by $111 million, or 76%, to $259 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $148 million for the same period of 2014. The increase is primarily due to increased interest expense of $95 million on our securitized debt collateralized by seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans due to the financing added for the acquisition of seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans during the second half of 2014 and in 2015. Interest expense on repurchase agreements increased by $33 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014, as repurchase agreements balances increased to finance both the Agency and Non-Agency portfolio. The interest rates were higher on repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency and Non-Agency MBS. The increase in interest rates for repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was driven by market factors and the increase in interest rates for repurchase agreements collateralized by Non-Agency MBS was driven by the addition of longer term repurchase agreements and anticipated increase in the federal funds rate. These increases were offset by a decline in interest expense of $23 million on our securitized debt, collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS and jumbo prime securitizations held in our consolidated VIEs as this portfolio continues to run-off.\nOur Agency RMBS are primarily financed with repurchase agreements. We secure our borrowings under these agreements by pledging our Agency RMBS as collateral to the lender. The collateral we pledge exceeds the amount of the borrowings under each agreement, typically with the extent of over-collateralization being at least 3% of the amount borrowed. If the counterparty to the repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations and we are not able to recover our pledged assets, we are at risk of losing the over-collateralized amount. The amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral.\nVariable Interest Entities\nUnrealized gains and losses include the change in market value, period over period, on our derivatives portfolio. Changes in market value are generally a result of changes in interest rates. The unrealized gains and losses of our derivatives portfolio are generally offset by net changes in our investment portfolio. We may or may not ultimately realize these unrealized derivative gains and losses depending on trade activity, changes in interest rates and the values of the underlying securities.\nThe interest rate environment over the last three years has been extremely volatile. During that period, we have experienced many fluctuations in the 10-year Treasury yield that have exceeded 50 basis points (0.50%) in a short timeframe. More broadly, the global fixed income, equity and commodity markets experienced market turbulence and increased volatility during 2015 as investors braced and waited for the Federal Reserve Bank to increase rates.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBecause we are unable to dispose of, monetize or pledge the RMBS or loans we transferred into the trusts, we also present our estimated economic book value. We believe this measure represents the estimated value of the securities issued by these trusts that we own. In contrast to GAAP book value, our estimated economic book value considers only the assets we own or are able to dispose of, pledge, or otherwise monetize. To determine our estimated economic book value, we consider only the fair value of the notes or certificates issued by the securitization and re-securitization trusts that we actually own. Accordingly, our estimated economic book value does not include assets or liabilities for which we have no direct ownership, specifically the notes or certificates of the securitization and re-securitization trusts that were sold to third parties.\nGains and Losses on Sales of Assets and Loss on extinguishment of securitized debt\nOur accounting policies for recognition of interest income and OTTI related to RMBS are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As noted therein, there are three different accounting models that may be applicable for purposes of the recognition of interest income and OTTI on RMBS, and include the following:\nWe hold our RMBS as available-for-sale, record these investments at estimated fair value as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, and include unrealized gains and losses considered to be temporary in Other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. From time to time, as part of the overall management of our portfolio, we may sell any of our RMBS investments and recognize a realized gain or loss as a component of earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income utilizing the specific identification method.\n\n\nWe collateralize the repurchase agreements we use to finance our operations with our MBS investments. Our counterparties negotiate a \u2018haircut' when we enter into a financing transaction, which varies from lender to lender. The size of the haircut reflects the perceived risk associated with holding the MBS by the lender. The haircut provides lenders with a cushion for daily market value movements that reduce the need for a margin call to be issued or margin to be returned as normal daily increases or decreases in MBS market values occur. At December 31, 2015, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 5.3% compared to a haircut on Agency MBS of 5.1% at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Non-Agency MBS was 32.9% compared to a haircut on Non-Agency MBS of 29.4% at December 31, 2014.\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition contain the assets and liabilities related to seventeen consolidated variable interest entities, or VIEs. Due to the non-recourse nature of these VIEs our net exposure to loss from investments in these entities is limited to our retained beneficial interests.\nRestricted Stock Grants\nNon-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40 is generally purchased at a discount to the principal amount. At the original acquisition date, we estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected and calibrate the present value of those amounts to our purchase price. In each subsequent financial reporting period, we are required to revise our estimates of the remaining timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Depending on the nature of the changes in the timing or amount of cash flows expected to be collected, whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayment assumptions, the following will occur:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized net losses on derivatives of $115 million compared to net losses of $186 million for the same period of 2014. The net gains and losses on our derivatives include both unrealized and realized gains and losses. Realized gains and losses include the net cash paid and received on our interest rate swaps during the period as well as sales and settlements of our Treasury futures and mortgage options. The realized loss on our derivative instruments is primarily a result of the pay fixed leg of our swaps carried at a higher interest rate than the received floating leg of these same swaps resulting in a net payment on the periodic settlement of the swaps during the year. We also incurred realized losses on our treasury futures for the year ended 2014 as interest rates declined during the year, resulting in net payments to close out our future positions as they came due.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased by $4.3 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. Economic interest expense increased by $104 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities is a result of the increase in leverage from Agency and Non-Agency repurchase agreements and securitized debt entered during, 2015, offset by declines in our securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS. The additional financing was used to increase our Agency RMBS and securitized residential mortgage loans. Our interest expense has increased due to the increase in average interest-bearing liabilities.\nWe granted 260,200 shares of restricted stock to employees of FIDAC and its affiliates and members of our Board of Directors on January 2, 2008. On February 2, 2015 we granted 84,700 shares of restricted stock to employees of FIDAC. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were approximately 71,000 and 39,400 unvested shares of restricted stock issued to our employees, respectively.\nInterest Income and Impairment on Non-Agency and Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities\nTo reduce the rate sensitivity of our Agency portfolio, we decreased our exposure to Agency MBS by more than $2.5 billion during 2015. We also sold Agency MBS with a 4% coupon for Agency MBS with a 3.5% coupon to mitigate prepayment risk as rates declined at certain points during 2015. At December 31, 2014, our portfolio of 4% Agency MBS was 75% of our total Agency MBS compared to 29% by December 31, 2015, while our portfolio of 3.5% Agency MBS increased from 18% at December 31, 2014 to 35% at December 31, 2015. We also significantly increased our Agency CMBS portfolio in 2015. We began the year with less than $250 million of Agency CMBS and increased this portfolio over $700 million to $952 million as of December 31, 2015. Our Agency CMBS portfolio is less interest rate sensitive than our Agency MBS portfolio because our Agency CMBS have lock out periods and prepayment penalties that protect the portfolio against prepayment risk, as well as attractive risk adjusted yields.\nG&A expenses were approximately $32 million, $20 million and $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in G&A expenses is primarily due to transition costs incurred as part of the Internalization of $9 million, which occurred during the second half of 2015. We also incurred deal expenses $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the call and re-securitization of certain of our subprime mortgage pools.\nBased on our calculations, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) and 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act.\nThe table below shows a summary of our net gain (loss) on derivative instruments, for the quarters ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nBased on our current portfolio, leverage ratio and available borrowing arrangements, we believe our assets will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short-term liquidity requirements. However, a decline in the value of our collateral could cause a temporary liquidity shortfall due to the timing of margin calls on the financing arrangements and the actual receipt of the cash related to principal paydowns. If our cash resources are at any time insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may have to sell investments, potentially at a loss, or issue debt or additional equity securities in a common stock offering.\nWe also have formed, and may in the future form, certain other wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that rely upon the exclusion from the definition of investment company under the Investment Company Act provided by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. The securities issued by any wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiary that relies on the exclusion from the definition of investment company provided by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7), together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis. We monitor our compliance with the 40% Test and the operations of our subsidiaries so that we and each of our subsidiaries may maintain compliance with an exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the determination of the appropriate accounting model for Non-Agency RMBS is dependent on management's assessment and judgment related to the following factors made as of the acquisition date:\nAs discussed above, on August 5, 2015, we entered into agreements to internalize our management. Prior to the Internalization, we were managed by FIDAC pursuant to the Management Agreement (the Management Agreement\u201d). In connection with the Internalization, we terminated the Management Agreement without the payment of any termination fee.\nFor our credit portfolio, we acquired, in the third quarter of 2014, the subordinate notes and call rights with respect to seven residential mortgage loan securitizations sponsored by Springleaf Financial. As planned, we exercised the calls rights to acquire the remaining residential mortgage loans, and then securitized those mortgage loans, for one of the Springleaf transactions in 2014 and for three of the Springleaf transactions that were eligible to be called in 2015. By exercising our call rights and securitizing the remaining mortgage loans, we were able to increase structural leverage while reducing interest costs on our investment in the mortgage loans. In addition, we executed one other securitization of seasoned subprime collateral in the second quarter of 2015.\n \u00b7 If there is a negative (or adverse) change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, and the securities' fair value is below its amortized cost, an OTTI loss equal to the adverse change in cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the securities' effective rate before impairment, is required to be recorded in current period earnings. For Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in future periods will decline because of the reduced balance of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied. Additionally, for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 325-40, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income during the period directly after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in such future period will decline, absent an increase in cash flows expected to be collected, because of the reduced amount of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied. An adverse change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has decreased from the most previous estimate. This change can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from increases in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, an adverse change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the negative impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults, or when the negative impact of an increase in estimated defaults exceeds the positive impact of a shortening of the timing of receipt of cash flows. \nIn determining the OTTI related to credit losses for Non-Agency RMBS securities accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40, we compare the present value of the remaining cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date (or last date previously revised) against the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected at the current financial reporting date. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows is the effective interest rate or effective yield used for income recognition purposes.\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 the remaining maturities on our RMBS repurchase agreements were as follows.\n \u00b7 If there is a positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, the effective interest rate in future accounting periods may increase resulting in an increase in the reported amount of interest income in future periods. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes must be considered significant for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 for the effective interest rate in future accounting periods to increase. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has increased from the previous estimate. This can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from reductions in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, a positive change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the positive impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the negative impact of increased defaults, or when the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults exceeds the negative impact of an extension of the timing of receipt of cash flows. \nTo the extent the inputs used to estimate fair value are observable, the values would be categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; otherwise they would be categorized as Level 3. The Company's fair value estimation process utilizes inputs other than quoted prices that are observed in the market. The Company's estimate of prepayment, default and severity curves all involve adjustments that are deemed to be significant to the fair value measurement process, which renders the resulting Non-Agency fair value estimates Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 assets represent approximately 55% and 49% of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Level 3 liabilities represent approximately 88% and 97%of total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. None of the liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 are Level 3.\nNet Economic Interest Income and the Average Earning Assets\nWe invest in RMBS representing interests in obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans. We delineate between (1) Agency RMBS and (2) Non-Agency RMBS as follows: The Agency RMBS are mortgage pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs\u201d), and other RMBS representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans issued or guaranteed as to principal and/or interest repayment by agencies of the U.S. Government or federally chartered corporations such as Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The Non-Agency RMBS are not issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae and are therefore subject to credit risk.\nOTTI losses are generated when fair values decline below our amortized cost basis, an unrealized loss, and the expected future cash flows decline from prior periods, an adverse change. When an unrealized loss and an adverse change in cash flows occur, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings. In addition, if we intend to sell a security, or believe we will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings equal to the unrealized loss.\nWe also use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risks. Under these swap agreements, we pledge Agency RMBS or cash as collateral as part of a margin arrangement for interest rate swaps that are in an unrealized loss position. If swap counterparty were to default on its obligation, we would be exposed to a loss to the extent that the amount of our Agency RMBS pledged exceeded the unrealized loss on the associated swaps and we were not able to recover the excess collateral.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 15 of this 2015 Form 10-K. The discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical in nature. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this 2015 Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nWe held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $114 million and $165 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. As a result of our operating, investing and financing activities described above, our cash position decreased by $51 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\n \u00b7 Our assessment of whether the security can be contractually prepaid such that we would not recover our initial investment. \nWe have engaged in transactions with residential mortgage lending operations of leading commercial banks and other originators in which we identified and re-underwrote residential mortgage loans owned by such entities, and purchased and securitized such residential mortgage loans. In the past we have also acquired formerly AAA-rated Non-Agency RMBS and immediately re-securitized those securities. We sold the resulting AAA-rated super senior RMBS and retained the rated or unrated mezzanine and subordinate RMBS.\nPortfolio Review\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income (subject to certain adjustments). We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Before we pay any dividend, we must first meet any operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our financing facilities and other debt payable.\nCore earnings\nInterest Income\nInterest Expense\nBased on the projected cash flows for our Non-Agency RMBS that are not of high credit quality, a portion of the original purchase discount is designated as Accretable Discount, which reflects the purchase discount expected to be accreted into interest income, and a portion is designated as Non-Accretable Difference, which represents the contractual principal on the security that is not expected to be collected. The amount designated as Non-Accretable Difference may be adjusted over time, based on the actual performance of the security, its underlying collateral, actual and projected cash flow from such collateral, economic conditions and other factors. If the performance of a security is more favorable than previously estimated, a portion of the amount designated as Non-Accretable Difference may be accreted into interest income over time. Conversely, if the performance of a security is less favorable than previously estimated, an OTTI may be recognized resulting in an increase in the amounts designated as Non-Accretable Difference.\nWe are a REIT primarily engaged in the business of investing, on a leveraged basis, in a diversified portfolio of mortgage assets, including Agency RMBS, Non-Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS, residential mortgage loans, and real estate related securities. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return.\nThe following table presents changes to Accretable Discount and Non-Accretable Difference as it pertains to our entire Non-Agency RMBS portfolio for assets with purchase discounts during the previous five quarters.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we declared dividends to common shareholders totaling $379 million, or $1.92 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we declared dividends to common shareholders totaling $370 million, or $1.80 per share.\nASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (ASC 310-30) - applies to Non-Agency RMBS where there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality and we do not expect to collect all contractual cash flows of the security.\n\nOur investing activities provided cash of approximately $2.0 billion, used cash of $6.1 billion and provided cash of $305 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we purchased investments of $7.7 billion, primarily Agency RMBS. This use of cash was offset during the year from sales of investments of $7.7 billion and principal repayments of $2.2 billion. The purchases and sales activity was primarily due to our continuing to balance our Agency portfolio to maximize spread income and provide liquidity for purchases of Non-Agency RMBS and mortgage loan pools. During the year ended December 31, 2014 we purchased investments of $12.1 billion, primarily Agency RMBS and securitized loans. This use of cash was offset during the period from sales of investments of $5.6 billion and principal repayments of $1.2 billion during 2014. Additionally, during 2014, we used cash of $774 million to acquire interests in a group of trusts collateralized by pools of seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans. During the year ended December 31, 2013 we generated cash from sales of RMBS investments of $1.2 billion and principal payments of $1.5 billion related to all our investment assets offset by purchases of $2.4 billion in RMBS securities.\nOur assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value are discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRefer to Note 2(p) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of accounting guidance recently adopted by the Company or expected to be adopted by the Company in the future.\nInterest income increased by $176 million, or 34%, to $688 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $512 million for the same period of 2013. The increase is primarily due to the increase in agency holdings of approximately $6.4 billion acquired during 2014 and the increase in securitized loans of approximately $4.5 billion also acquired during 2014. Interest income on our Agency RMBS portfolio increased by $110 million and interest income on our securitized loan portfolio increased by $100 million. Both portfolios increased from the prior year due to acquisitions during 2014 financed by additional repurchase agreements and secured debt as we increased our leverage ratio during 2014.The increases are partially offset by a decline in interest income on our Non-Agency portfolio of $34 million year over year as natural principal payments and expected losses have reduced the interest earning balance of these assets.\nWe have organized ourselves as a holding company and conduct our real estate businesses primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries and at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. If we were to become regulated as an investment company, our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced.\nDuring this volatile market period, we have continued to acquire investments that we believe provide a risk-adjusted return and income that support the dividend that we distribute to our investors.\nWe have elected and believe we are organized and have operated in a manner that qualifies us to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. A REIT generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. Furthermore, substantially all of our assets consist of qualified REIT real estate assets (of the type described in Code Section 856(c)(5)). We calculate that at least 75% of our assets were qualified REIT assets, as defined in the Code, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We also calculate that our revenues qualified for the 75% REIT income test and for the 95% REIT income test for years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. We also met all REIT requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our REIT taxable income. Therefore, as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we believe that we qualified as a REIT under the Code.\nWhile we disagree that the CFTC's position that mortgage real estate investment trusts that use swaps as part of their business model fall within the statutory definition of a CPO, we have submitted a claim for the relief set forth in the no-action relief entitled No-Action Relief from the Commodity Pool Operator Registration Requirement for Commodity Pool Operators of Certain Pooled Investment Vehicles Organized as Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts\u201d and believe we meet the criteria for such relief set forth therein.\n\n\nAccounting policies are integral to understanding our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions, on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements. Our significant accounting policies and accounting estimates are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies are described in this section. An accounting policy is considered critical if it requires management to make assumptions or judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made or require significant management judgment in interpreting the accounting literature. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, or other accounting judgments were made, this could have a significant and potentially adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These critical accounting policies were developed by management, and reviewed by our auditors, prior to being presented to and discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nNet Economic Interest Income\nOver the past several years, several large European financial institutions have experienced financial difficulty and have been either rescued by government assistance or by other large European banks or institutions. Some of these financial institutions or their U.S. subsidiaries have provided us financing under repurchase agreements or we have entered into interest rate swaps with such institutions. We have entered into repurchase agreements or interest rate swaps with six counterparties as of December 31, 2015 that is either domiciled in Europe or is a U.S.-based subsidiary of a European-domiciled financial institution. The following table summarizes our exposure to such counterparties at December 31, 2015:\nDividends\nTo meet our longer term liquidity needs (greater than one year), we expect our principal sources of capital and funds to continue to be provided by earnings from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities, as well as proceeds from equity offerings.\n \nNet Income Summary\nOur investment strategy is intended to take advantage of opportunities in the current interest rate and credit environment. We expect to adjust our strategy to changing market conditions by shifting our asset allocations across these various asset classes as interest rate and credit cycles change over time. We believe that our strategy will enable us to pay dividends and achieve capital appreciation throughout changing market cycles. We expect to take a long-term view of assets and liabilities, and our reported earnings and estimates of the fair value of our investments at the end of a financial reporting period will not significantly impact our objective of providing attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long-term.\nThe following table presents details of each asset class in our portfolio at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The principal or notional value represents the interest income earning balance of each class. The weighted average figures are weighted by each investment's respective principal/notional value in the asset class.\nNet Income (Loss) and Return on Average Equity\nCore earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income excluding unrealized gains on the aggregate portfolio, impairment losses, realized gains on sales of investments, realized gains or losses on futures, realized gains or losses on swap terminations, gain on deconsolidation, extinguishment of debt and certain other non-recurring gains or losses. As defined, core earnings include interest income and expense as well as realized losses on interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk. Core earnings are provided for the purpose of comparability to other peer issuers, but have important limitations. Core earnings as described above helps evaluate our financial performance without the impact of certain transactions and is of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, core earnings should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net income or net income per basic share computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOther Matters\nASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (ASC 325-40) - applies to certain Non-Agency RMBS not within the scope of ASC 310-20 or ASC 310-30. These include Non-Agency RMBS which is not of high credit quality at the time of purchase or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that we would not recover substantially all of our recorded investment.\n o identify itself as a mortgage REIT\u201d in Item G of its last U.S. income tax return on Form 1120-REIT; or \nThis Management Discussion and Analysis section contains analysis and discussion of financial information that utilizes or presents ratios based on GAAP book value. The table and discussion below present our estimated economic book value. We calculate and disclose this non-GAAP measurement because we believe it represents an estimate of the fair value of the assets we own or are able to dispose of, pledge, or otherwise monetize. The estimated economic book value should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for book value computed in accordance with GAAP.\nSecured Debt Financing Transactions\nOur estimate of economic book value has important limitations. Our estimate of fair value is as of a point in time and subject to significant judgment, primarily the estimate of the fair value of the securities issued by the trusts which we own and can freely sell or pledge. Should we sell the assets in our portfolio, we may realize materially different proceeds from the sale than we have estimated as of the reporting date.\nOur net income was $250 million, $589 million and $363 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Economic net interest income as a percentage of average equity increased by 164 basis point at December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. Return on average equity decreased by 541 basis point for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014 due to lower income in the year 2015, primarily as a result of unrealized losses on financial instruments at fair value.\n\nTo meet our short term (one year or less) liquidity needs, we expect to continue to borrow funds in the form of repurchase agreements and, subject to market conditions, other types of financing. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our master repurchase agreements generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or SIFMA, as to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all securities we have initially sold under the repurchase transaction. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, cross default provisions, required haircuts (or the percentage that is subtracted from the value of RMBS that collateralizes the financing), purchase price maintenance requirements, and requirements that all disputes related to the repurchase agreement be litigated or arbitrated in a particular jurisdiction. These provisions may differ for each of our lenders.\n\nOTTI losses were $67 million, $64 million and $45 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Of these amounts, $58 million, $59 million and $38 million of the OTTI for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was related to securities included in our consolidated VIEs. As of December 31, 2015, we had 26 non-agency RMBS securities subject to OTTI in an unrealized loss position totaling $10 million for which we did not recognize impairment. We intend to hold these securities until they recover their amortized cost. We continue to monitor our investment portfolio and will record an OTTI for all investments in an unrealized loss position for which we do not believe we will recover our amortized cost prior to maturity or sale.\nThe table below shows our economic net interest income, realized gains (losses) on sale of assets and the credit related OTTI, realized and unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps and IOs, total management fee and G&A expenses, and income tax, each as a percentage of average equity, and the return on average equity for the periods presented.\nDuring the year of 2015, we decreased our leverage as we sold portions of our Agency MBS portfolio to generate liquidity to settle repurchase agreements as well as to acquire a pool of mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015, we had repurchase agreements with 24 counterparties. All of our repurchase agreements are secured by Agency and Non-Agency RMBS or, in limited circumstances, cash. Under these repurchase agreements we may not be able to reclaim our collateral but still be obligated to pay our repurchase obligations. We mitigate this risk by limiting our exposure to any counterparty to approximately 10% or less of our total equity, as well as ensuring all our counterparties are highly rated. Therefore, we believe the risk of loss of our collateral posted is mitigated by the terms of our agreements. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $8.8 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively, of securities pledged against our repurchase agreement obligations.\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions will be determined by our Board of Directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to maintain our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and financial condition are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation.\n \u00b7 Our assessment of the probability of collection of all contractual cash flows. \n\nThe following tables summarize our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The estimated principal repayment schedule of the securitized debt is based on expected cash flows of the residential mortgage loans or RMBS, as adjusted for expected principal writedowns on the underlying collateral of the debt.\nCapital Expenditure Requirements\nAs a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, gained jurisdiction over the regulation of interest rate swaps. The CFTC has asserted that this causes the operators of mortgage real estate investment trusts that use swaps as part of their business model to fall within the statutory definition of Commodity Pool Operator, or CPO, and, absent relief from the Division or the Commission, to register as CPOs. On December 7, 2012, as a result of numerous requests for no-action relief from the CPO registration requirement for operators of mortgage real estate investment trusts, the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight of the CFTC issued no-action relief entitled No-Action Relief from the Commodity Pool Operator Registration Requirement for Commodity Pool Operators of Certain Pooled Investment Vehicles Organized as Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts\u201d that permits a CPO to receive relief by filing a claim to perfect the use of the relief. A claim submitted by a CPO will be effective upon filing, so long as the claim is materially complete. The conditions that must be met to claim the relief are that the mortgage real estate investment trust must:\n\nWe discuss the changes in our net income in greater detail in the discussion on our results of operations below.\nInvestment Portfolio\nChanges in actual prepayments will impact the amount of interest income recognized in each financial reporting period for RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20. We estimate expected prepayment as further described below.\n\nBusiness Environment\nFinancial Condition\nIn connection with the Internalization and the termination of the Management Agreement, we became internally managed and hired employees. Thus, as of August 5, 2015, we began to incur compensation and benefits costs. Compensation and benefits costs have replaced the management fee as the cost to operate our business. Compensation and benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11 million.\n\nEstimated Economic Book Value\nFor re-securitized RMBS transactions and loan securitizations, we present the pre-securitized assets transferred into the consolidated trusts in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Non-Agency or Securitized loans held for investment. Post securitization RMBS assets sold are presented as liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Securitized debt, collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS and Securitized debt, collateralized by loans held for investment. We have presented the underlying securities we transferred to the trusts for the calculation of GAAP book value at fair value and recorded the corresponding liability for the notes or certificates sold to third parties at amortized cost or fair value. Fair value adjustments that are not credit related are recorded in Other comprehensive income. Credit related impairments are deemed other-than-temporary and are recorded in earnings.\nNet realized gains on sales of investments were $77 million, $92 million and $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We do not forecast sales of investments as we generally expect to invest for long term gains. However, from time to time, we may sell assets to create liquidity necessary to pursue new opportunities, achieve targeted leverage ratios as well as for gains when prices indicate a sale is most beneficial to us, or is the most prudent course of action to maintain a targeted risk adjusted yield for our investors.\nThe determination of which accounting model to apply will have a significant impact on the amounts of interest income and OTTI losses reflected in the results of operations because each accounting model has different requirements regarding the cash flows used to calculate interest income and impairments (i.e., contractual cash flows vs. expected cash flows) and the manner of such calculations, and the impact of changes in prepayment assumptions on interest income or OTTI losses.\nImpact of prepayment assumptions on RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20\n\nInterest expense for GAAP reporting does not include the periodic costs of our derivatives, which are reported separately.\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities.\nWe focus our investment activities primarily on acquiring Non-Agency and Agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, ( MBS\u201d), and on purchasing residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 46% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS, 20% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, and 34% of our investment portfolio was securitized residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2014, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 52% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS, 16% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, and 32% of our investment portfolio was securitized residential mortgage loans.\n\nUse of Estimates\nWe had no preferred stock issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n o if it has not yet filed its first U.S. income tax return on Form 1120-REIT, disclose to its shareholders that it intends to identify itself as a mortgage REIT\u201d in its first U.S. income tax return on Form 1120-REIT. \nInflation\nThe table below presents our average daily repurchase balance and the repurchase balance at each period end for the periods presented. Our balance at period-end tends to fluctuate from the average daily balances due to the adjusting of the size of our portfolio by using leverage. Our average repurchase agreement balance for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to our average repurchase agreement balance for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to additional borrowings on our repurchase agreements in excess of repayments during 2015. We continue to deploy capital for strategic purchases of investments.\nBusiness Operations\nLiquidity measures our ability to meet cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay our borrowings, purchase RMBS, mortgage loans and other assets for our portfolio, pay dividends and other general business needs. Our principal sources of capital and funds for additional investments primarily include earnings from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities, and proceeds from equity offerings.\nCurrent Period\nGAAP requires us to consolidate certain securitizations and re-securitization transactions where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. In these transactions, we transfer assets to the trusts, which issue tranches of senior and subordinate notes or certificates. We sell the senior tranches and therefore have no continuing involvement in these trusts other than being a holder of notes or certificates issued by the trusts, with the same rights as other holders of the notes or certificates. However, with respect to certain VIEs collateralized by loans held for investment, we have the ability to approve loan modifications and determine the course of action to be taken as it relates to loans in technical default, including whether or not to proceed with foreclosure. The notes and certificates we own that were issued by the trusts are largely subordinated interests in those trusts. The trusts have no recourse to our assets other than pursuant to a breach by us of the transaction documents related to the transfer of the assets by us to the trusts, but are presented as if we own 100% of the trust.\nOur primary source of income is interest income earned on our assets. Our economic net interest income equals interest income excluding interest earned on cash and cash equivalents less interest expense and realized losses on our interest rate hedges.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDue to the consolidation of these VIEs, our actual ownership interests in the securitization and re-securitizations have been eliminated in consolidation and the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition reflect both the assets held and non-recourse debt issued to third parties by these VIEs. In addition, our operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts related to the assets and liabilities of the VIEs as opposed to the actual economic interests we own in these VIEs. Our interest in these VIEs is restricted to the beneficial interests we retained in these transactions. We are not obligated to provide any financial support to these VIEs.\n\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe are not required to maintain any specific debt-to-equity ratio. We believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality and risk of those assets. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 our total debt was approximately $11.7 billion and $13.6 billion which represented a debt-to-equity ratio for both periods of approximately 4.0:1 and 3.8:1, respectively. We include our repurchase agreements and securitized debt in the numerator of our debt-to-equity ratio and stockholders' equity as the denominator.\n \u00b7 Our assessment of the credit quality of the asset, including its credit rating at the acquisition date and whether the security has experienced deterioration in credit quality since its inception. \nInterest income increased by $185 million, or 27%, to $873 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $688 million for the same period of 2014. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loan pools during the second half of 2014 and 2015. Seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans contributed $288 million of interest income during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $104 million for the same period of 2014. In addition we also increased our agency holdings which contributed an additional $12 million in interest income for the year as compared to 2014. These increases were offset by a decline in interest income of $38 million on our Non-Agency RMBS and jumbo prime securitizations held in consolidated VIEs as these portfolios continue to run-off.\nOur economic net interest income equals interest income, less interest expense and realized losses on our interest rate swaps. Realized losses on our interest rate swaps are the periodic net settlement payments made or received. For the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures throughout this section, interest expense includes net payments on our interest rate swaps, which is presented as a part of Realized gains (losses) on derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest rate swaps are used to manage the increase in interest paid on repurchase agreements in a rising rate environment. Presenting the net contractual interest payments on interest rate swaps with the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities reflects our total contractual interest payments. We believe this presentation is useful to investors because it depicts the economic value of our investment strategy by showing actual interest expense and net interest income. Where indicated, interest expense, including interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic interest expense. Where indicated, net interest income reflecting interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic net interest income.\nOur net income decreased by $339 million to $250 million, or $1.25 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $589 million, or $2.87 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest income increased by $185 million, or 27%, to $873 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $688 million for the same period of 2014. This increase in interest income was offset by an increase of $111 million in interest expense to $259 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $148 million for the same period of 2014. This resulted in an overall increase of $73 million in net interest income, year over year as we have continued to rebalance our portfolio to more Non-Agency holdings with higher costs of financing, but higher interest returns.\nThe overall decrease in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period of 2014 is attributable primarily to an increase in net unrealized losses on financial instruments at fair value of $352 million. The Company recognized an unrealized loss for the year ended 2015 of $158 million, compared to an unrealized gain on financial instruments at fair value of $194 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. A significant portion of our financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. This can result in significant changes in net income as prices change as a result of changes in market conditions.\nServicing fees paid by our consolidated VIEs were approximately $25 million, $10 million and $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These servicing fees are related to the consolidation of the whole loan securitization vehicles and are paid from interest income earned by the VIEs. The increase in servicing fees is primarily due to the addition of subprime mortgage loans from the prior year. Subprime mortgage loans average asset balance increased to $4.5 billion for year ended December 31, 2015 from $1.4 billion for the same period of 2014.\nInterest expense increased by $46 million, or 45%, to $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $102 million for the same period of 2013. The increase is primarily due to increased interest expense of $24 million on our securitized debt and $21 million on our repurchase agreements. During 2014, we increased leverage to finance additional investments in Agency RMBS, Non-Agency RMBS, as well as securitized loans held for investment. Our repurchase agreement obligation increased by $6.8 billion to $8.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 as compared to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2013.\nThe consolidated financial statements include, on a consolidated basis, our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities, or VIEs, for which we are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nAt December 31, 2015, we did not use credit default swaps or other forms of credit protection to hedge the exposures summarized in the table above.\nOur operating activities provided net cash of approximately $396 million, 183 million and $305 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The cash provided by our operations is primarily due to interest received in excess of interest paid during the period. During 2015, interest received net of interest paid was $645 million. This cash received was offset in part by payments on derivatives of $158 million, including $99 million paid for termination of existing swaps during the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2014, interest received net of interest paid was $466 million. During 2014, we paid cash to cover margin requirements on our interest rate swaps and other financial instruments of approximately $186 million, which is primarily reflected in other assets and other payments from derivative sales and settlements during the year ended December 31, 2014. The cash provided by operating activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to prior year due primarily to a decrease in interest collected on the portfolio, net of interest paid, of $61 million, offset in part by lower management fees paid during 2013 as compared to prior year.\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nOur financing activities used cash of $2.5 billion, provided cash of $5.7 billion and used cash of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid proceeds on our repurchase agreements, net of proceeds received on our repurchase agreements of $1.0 billion. We also repaid principal of our securitized debt of $2.3 billion and paid dividends of $381 million. Additionally, during the second half of 2015, we also paid $250 million to repurchase common stock outstanding. These uses of cash were offset, in part, by receipt of cash on debt issuance of $1.5 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received proceeds on our repurchase agreements, net of repayments on our repurchase agreements of $6.8 billion and received proceeds from securitized debt borrowings of $392 million. These proceeds were offset by payments and repurchases on our securitized debt of $583 million and payments of dividends of $575 million. The payments of dividends during the year ended December 31, 2014 includes the $205 million of special dividends announced in the fourth quarter of 2013, but paid during the first quarter of 2014. The year ended December 31, 2013 reflected payments on securitized debt borrowings of $914 million, payment of dividends of $370 million and proceeds from repurchase agreements, net of payments on repurchase agreements, of $131 million.\n", "item_7_text": "\nOur interest rate swaps are primarily used to economically hedge the effects of changes in interest rates on our portfolio specifically our floating rate debt. Therefore, we included the periodic interest costs of the interest rate swaps for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 on these economic hedges in our presentation of economic net interest income and our net interest spreads. As we do not account for these as hedges for GAAP presentation, we present these gains and losses separately in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The increase in the net periodic interest cost of the interest rate swaps are primarily due to declines in interest rates year over year as we pay a fixed rate on our interest rate swaps and are receiving a lower floating rate.\nOur Core earnings for the year was $472 million or $2.37 per average basic common share, compared to $441 million or $2.14 per average basic common share. Core earnings increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014 as a result of increase in net interest income offset partially by increased servicing fees, internalization costs and deal expenses.\nNet Interest Rate Spread\nAs discussed in Item 1 Business\u201d section, in August 2015, we became internally managed. Specifically, we now have employees and no longer rely on a third-party manager to operate our business. In connection with the Internalization, we have relocated to new office space in New York, and hired the additional staff necessary to complete the internalization. Further, before year end, we built, tested, and completed the construction of a new data center, back up facility and have an independent software suite. We expect operating expenses to be lower on an internalized basis compared to the prior externally managed model and have eliminated certain inherent conflicts particular to externally managed companies.\nContributing to the overall increased economic interest expense are higher interest rates. Average one-month and six month LIBOR were up four basis point and 15 basis points, respectively, in the year of 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. While we do acquire interest rate hedges to mitigate changes in interest rate risks, the hedges may not fully offset interest expense movements.\nWe use leverage to seek to increase our potential returns and to finance the acquisition of our assets. Our income is generated primarily by the difference, or net spread, between the income we earn on our assets and the cost of our borrowings. We expect to finance our investments using a variety of financing sources including, when available, repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities and securitizations. We may manage our debt and interest rate risk by utilizing interest rate hedges, such as interest rate swaps, caps, options and futures to reduce the effect of interest rate fluctuations related to our financing sources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur repurchase agreements have original maturities ranging from 30 to 956 days. The average days to maturity on our repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were 77 days and 100 days, respectively. We expect to renew each of our repurchase agreements at maturity. When we renew our repurchase agreements, there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain as favorable an interest rate as a result of rising rates. We offset the risk of our repurchase agreements primarily through the use of interest rate swaps. The average remaining maturities on our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2015 range from less than 1 year to 19 years and have a weighted average maturity of approximately 4 years. We use these interest rate swaps to protect the portfolio from short term changes in interest rates. We currently have three swap counterparties. When our interest rate swaps are in a net loss position (expected cash payments are in excess of expected cash receipts on the swaps), we post collateral as required by the terms of our swap agreements. As of December 31, 2015, we have posted $94 million of cash and securities as collateral to our swap counterparties.\nFor Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40, the reported amounts of interest income and OTTI are significantly impacted by management judgments around both the amount and timing of credit losses (defaults) and prepayments. Interest income on these Non-Agency RMBS is recognized initially and in subsequent periods based on the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected, as opposed to being based on contractual cash flows. The accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 do not provide for delineations between individual changes in cash flow estimates based on expected defaults or prepayments. Accordingly, we are required to consider the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments to determine the amount of interest income to recognize. Furthermore, the overall impact on the amount and timing of future cash flows whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayments also impacts the amount of OTTI losses recognized in earnings.\nThe following table provides GAAP measures of net income and net income per basic share available to common stockholders for the periods presented and details with respect to reconciling the line items to core earnings and related per average basic common share amounts:\nThe following table shows our average earning assets held, interest earned on assets, yield on average interest earning assets, average debt balance, economic interest expense, economic average cost of funds, economic net interest income, and net interest rate spread for the periods presented.\nTreasury futures are not included in our economic interest expense and economic net interest income. We also do not include any gains or losses on our mortgage options in our economic interest expense and economic net interest income as the mortgage options were sold for income generation and not as an economic hedge for changes in interest rates in our portfolio. As we identify opportunities in the mortgage backed securities market, we may from time to time purchase or sell mortgage options, including both call and put options to take advantage of these opportunities. We had no mortgage options as of December 31, 2015. The realized gains on our mortgage options for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $445 thousand, $7.5 million and $12 million, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded unrealized losses in earnings of $158 million, unrealized gain of $194 million and unrealized loss of $44 million, respectively, on the financial instruments carried at fair value.\nOur economic net interest income increased by $186 million to $874 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $688 million for the same period of 2014. Our net interest rate spread, which equals the yield on our average assets less the economic average cost of funds decreased by approximately 90 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. The net interest margin, which equals the net economic interest income as a percentage of the net average balance of our interest-earning assets less our interest-bearing liabilities, decreased by 100 basis for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. Average earning assets increased by $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the same period of the prior year, primarily as a result of the increase in subprime residential mortgage loans held for investment. Our net interest margin declined due to a decline in the total average yield on our interest-earning assets which was not fully offset by the decline in our average cost of funds. The portfolio has experienced several changes from the same period for the prior year as we have increased our average Agency RMBS and seasoned sub-prime securitized loans held for investment and our jumbo prime securitized loans have declined as a percentage of the total portfolio. These changes have increased our leverage, resulting in lower net interest rate spreads, but higher total interest income.\nStockholders' Equity\nNet gains (losses) on derivatives\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition separately present: (i) our direct assets and liabilities, and (ii) the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization vehicles. Assets of all consolidated VIEs can only be used to satisfy the obligations of those VIEs, and the liabilities of consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to us.\nWe believe that our cash balances provide an appropriate level of liquidity. Even though we have unrestricted Agency MBS investments, we expect to meet our future cash needs primarily from principal and interest payments on our portfolio and do not anticipate we will need to sell unrestricted Agency MBS investments to meet our liquidity needs. We expect to continue to finance our MBS portfolio largely through repurchase agreements and loans through the securitization market. In addition, we may from time to time sell securities or issue debt as a source of cash to fund new purchases.\nDetermination of appropriate accounting model for Non-Agency RMBS\nVIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors (i) do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and/or (ii) do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The entity that consolidates a VIE is known as its primary beneficiary, and is generally the entity with (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and (ii) the right to receive benefits from the VIE or the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. For VIEs' that do not have substantial on-going activities, the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance may be determined by an entity's involvement with the design of the VIE.\nThe calculation of estimated economic book value described above is used by management to understand the fair value of the assets we own and the liabilities for which we are legally obligated, and is presented for informational use only. The estimated economic book value should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for book value computed in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have aggregated all the assets and liabilities of the consolidated securitization vehicles due to our determination that these entities are substantively similar and therefore a further disaggregated presentation would not be more meaningful. The notes to our consolidated financial statements describe our direct assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization vehicles. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our investments in VIEs.\n \u00b7 Limit the initial margin and premiums required to establish its commodity interest positions to no more than five percent of the fair market value of the mortgage real estate investment trust's total assets; \nThe borrowing rate at which we are able to finance our assets using repurchase agreements is typically correlated to LIBOR and the term of the financing. The table below shows our average borrowed funds, economic interest expense, average cost of funds (inclusive of realized losses on interest rate swaps), average one-month LIBOR, average six-month LIBOR, average one-month LIBOR relative to average six-month LIBOR, and average cost of funds relative to average one- and six- month LIBOR.\nDuring 2015, the Company also purchased $1.3 billion of securitized debt collateralized by subprime residential mortgage loans for a cash payment of $1.3 billion resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6 million. During 2014, the Company purchased $54 million of securitized debt collateralized by non-agency RMBS for cash payments of $56 million, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2 million. When the Company acquires its outstanding debt, it extinguishes the outstanding debt and recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the carrying value of the debt and the cost to acquire the debt which is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income as a loss on extinguishment of debt during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n\nIf the European credit crisis continues to impact these major European financial institutions, it is possible that it will also impact the operations of their U.S. subsidiaries. Our financings and operations could be adversely affected by such events. We monitor our exposure to our repurchase agreement and swap counterparties on a regular basis, using various methods, including review of recent rating agency actions, financial relief plans, credit spreads or other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements or the fair value of swaps with our counterparties. We make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements or interest rate swaps, or may try to take other actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when necessary.\nOur recourse leverage is 2.7:1 and 2.6:1 for the periods ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Our recourse leverage excludes the securitized debt which can only be repaid from the proceeds on the assets securing this debt in their respective VIEs. The decrease in our recourse leverage compared to September 30, 2014 is a result of the sale of higher leverage agency positions to acquire residential mortgage loans. Our recourse leverage is presented as a ratio of our repurchase agreements, which are recourse to the assets of the Company, to our economic net equity calculated as a part of our economic book value.\nImpact of default and prepayment assumptions on Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40\nWe have elected the fair value option with changes in fair value reflected in earnings for our Agency and Non-Agency IO RMBS securities, securitized loans held for investment and the related financing for the securitized loans consolidated as a VIE in our statement of financial condition. The table below shows the unpaid principal, fair value and impact of change in fair value on each of these financial instruments:\n\nThe following table reconciles the GAAP and non-GAAP measurements reflected in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nASC 310-20, Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (ASC 310-20) - applies to all Agency RMBS and certain Non-Agency RMBS of high credit quality that, at the time of purchase, we expect to collect all contractual cash flows and the security cannot be contractually prepaid in such a way that we would not recover substantially all of our recorded investment.\nThe table below presents our net income on a GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nOther than as discussed below under Restricted Stock Grants,\u201d we did not issue any shares during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nDuring the year of 2015, we called securitized debt, collateralized by loans held for investment with an unpaid principal balance of $1.3 billion at par. This outstanding debt acquired is part of a securitization vehicle which has a call date in 2016. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued new debt, collateralized by these same loans held for investment, with an unpaid principal balance of $1.7 billion for $1.7 billion.\nFair Value Measurements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, on an aggregate basis, we purchased $7.7 billion of invested assets, sold $7.7 billion of invested assets, and received $1.4 billion in principal payments related to our Agency and Non-Agency RMBS. In addition, we used $2.1 billion of proceeds received from principal and interest on our investments to repay principal on our securitized debt.\nOur derivative portfolio primarily includes interest rate swaps, swaptions, Treasury futures, and mortgage options. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we terminated interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of $1.5 billion for $99 million. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, swaps with a notional value of $800 million matured. These terminations and maturities were offset by an additional $1.5 billion of swaps and swaptions added during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced our Treasury positions by $488 million of notional. Changes in our derivative positions were a result of changes in the portfolio composition and changes in interest rates.\n\nWe incurred management fees of $25 million, $33 and $26 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We also recognized reimbursements from FIDAC related to the amended Management Agreement of approximately $7 million, $9 million and $7 million for each of the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The management fee is based on our stockholders' equity as defined in the Management Agreement. See further discussion of the management fee, including amendments to the Management Agreement, as well as other agreements with FIDAC in our discussion of related party transactions below.\nExposure to European Financial Counterparties\nSection 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer's total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (the 40% test\u201d). Excluded from the term investment securities,\u201d among other things, are securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that rely on the exemptions from registration other than Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, such as the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.\n \u00b7 Ensure that interests in the mortgage real estate investment trust are not marketed to the public as or in a commodity pool or otherwise as or in a vehicle for trading in the commodity futures, commodity options, or swaps markets; and \nWe make investment decisions based on various factors, including expected cash yield, relative value, risk-adjusted returns, current and projected credit fundamentals, current and projected macroeconomic considerations, current and projected supply and demand, credit and market risk concentration limits, liquidity, cost of financing and financing availability, as well as maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act.\nOn August 5, 2015, as discussed above under The Internalization,\u201d we announced the mutual agreement to terminate the Management Agreement between us and our Manager, effective immediately. Thus, as of August 5, 2015, we began incurring compensation expense as we are now internally managed (whereas prior to the Internalization, such expenses were incurred by our Manager, and we paid a management fee). The table below shows our total management fee and general and administrative, or G&A, expenses, compensation and benefit expense and deal expenses as compared to average total assets and average equity for the periods presented.\nAs the fair value of the Non-Agency MBS is more difficult to determine, as well as more volatile period to period than Agency MBS, the Non-Agency MBS typically requires a larger haircut. Repurchase agreements also subject us to two types of margin calls. First, there are monthly margin calls that are triggered as principal payments and pre-payments are received by us as these payments lower the value of the collateral. As a result, we expect to receive margin calls from our repurchase counterparties monthly simply due to the principal paydowns on our Agency RMBS. The monthly principal payments and pre-payments are not known in advance and vary depending on the behavior of the borrowers related to the underlying mortgages. Second, counterparties make margin calls or return margin as a result of normal daily increases or decreases in asset fair values. In addition, when financing assets using standard form of SIFMA Master Repurchase Agreements, the counterparty to the agreement typically nets its exposure to us on all outstanding repurchase agreements and issues margin calls if movement of the fair values of the assets in the aggregate exceeds their allowable exposure to us. A decline in asset fair values could create a margin call, or may create no margin call depending on the counterparty's specific policy. In addition, counterparties consider a number of factors, including their aggregate exposure to us as a whole and the number of days remaining before the repurchase transaction closes prior to issuing a margin call. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on how we determine the fair values of the RMBS collateralizing our repurchase agreements.\nOn August 31, 2011, the SEC issued a concept release titled Companies Engaged in the Business of Acquiring Mortgages and Mortgage-Related Instruments\u201d (SEC Release No. IC-29778). Under the concept release, the SEC is reviewing interpretive issues related to the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exemption. We will continue to monitor developments related to this matter.\nOur determination to consolidate these seventeen VIEs was significantly influenced by management's judgment related to the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities and the identification of the party with the power over such activities. For the residential mortgage loan securitizations, we determined that our ability to replace defaulting loans with performing loans resulted in us having the power that most significantly impacts the economic performance of the VIE. For the five consolidated RMBS re-securitization transactions, we determined that no party has power over any ongoing activities of the entities and therefore the determination of the primary beneficiary should be based on involvement with the initial design of the entity. Since we transferred the RMBS to the securitization entities, we determined we had the power over the design of the entity, which resulted in us being considered the primary beneficiary. This determination was influenced by the amount of economic exposure to the financial performance of the entity and required a significant management judgment in determining that we should consolidate these five entities.\nResults of Operations for the years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments at Fair Value\nIn August 2015, we announced a $250 million stock buyback plan. Immediately following the announcement, we entered into a share repurchase agreement with Annaly to acquire the 9 million shares owned by Annaly. We used the remaining amount available after the purchase of shared owned by Annaly to purchase shares in the open market during the third and fourth quarter of 2015. The stock buyback reduced shares outstanding by 18 million shares or 9% of shares outstanding prior to the buyback. On February 18, 2016, the Board of Directors increased the existing share buyback program by $100 million to $350 million.\nNet other-than-temporary credit impairment losses\nOur net income increased by $226 million to $589 million, or $2.87 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $363 million, or $1.77 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 over the same period of 2013 is primarily attributable to higher interest income, net of interest expense, of $130 million, to $540 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $410 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase in net interest income is due to the increase in invested assets from the acquisition of additional Agency RMBS and securitized loans held for investment. In addition to the increase in net interest income, we recognized gains as a result of changes in fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value of $238 million. The Company recognized a gain of $194 million in fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a loss of $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This gain from increase in fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value was offset by net unrealized losses on derivatives as a result of changes in fair value on derivatives of $138 million. The Company recognized net unrealized losses on derivatives of $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a gain of $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nWe currently consolidate twelve residential mortgage loan securitizations and five RMBS re-securitization transactions which are VIEs. The residential mortgage loan securitizations contain jumbo prime residential mortgage loans we purchased during 2007 and 2008 and securitized shortly thereafter. The RMBS re-securitization transactions contain Non-Agency RMBS comprised of primarily what we classify as collateral backed by Alt-A first lien mortgages of 2005-2007 vintages. We categorize collateral as Alt-A regardless of whether the loans were originally described as prime\u201d if the behavior of the collateral when we purchased the security more resembles typical Alt-A collateral. We define Alt-A collateral characteristics to be evidenced by the 60+ day delinquency bucket of the pool being greater than 5% and the weighted average FICO scores at the time of origination as greater than 650.\nAgency RMBS and Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20 may experience an OTTI loss. The OTTI loss recognized in earnings will be calculated based on the present value of the contractual cash flows expected to be collected. Subsequent to recognition of an OTTI loss, we recognize income on these securities under ASC 310-30 as further described below.\n\nFor Agency and Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20, the amount of interest income recorded over the life of a security will be equal to the contractual cash flows of the security and the accretion/amortization of any purchase discount or premium. The amount of interest income reported in any particular financial reporting period will, however, vary depending on the actual and estimated prepayments on the security. For Agency RMBS purchased at a premium to the principal amount, increases in prepayment speeds will generally result in a reduction of the recorded amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period whereas decreases in prepayment speeds will generally result in an increase in the amount of interest income in a particular financial reporting period. The opposite is generally the case for Agency RMBS purchased at a discount to the principal amount. That is, as prepayment speeds increase, interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally increase, whereas interest income reported in a particular financial reporting period will generally decrease when prepayment speeds decline. However, volatility in the reported amount of interest income will result when there are significant changes in actual or future expected prepayment speeds regardless of the direction of those changes. This volatility is because the accounting model that we apply under ASC 310-20 requires us to record a cumulative adjustment, on a retrospective basis from the acquisition date of the security, when there are changes in prepayment speeds. That cumulative adjustment at each reporting date is intended to reflect the most current estimate of the timing of prepayments over the life of the security (both actual prepayments that have occurred in the past and the timing of prepayments that will occur in the future).\nCertain of our subsidiaries, including Chimera RMBS Whole Pool, LLC (f/k/a Chimera Asset Holding LLC) and certain subsidiaries that we may form in the future, rely on the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or the SEC), requires us to invest at least 55% of our assets in mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate\u201d (or Qualifying Real Estate Assets) and at least 80% of our assets in Qualifying Real Estate Assets plus real estate related assets. The assets that we acquire, therefore, are limited by the provisions of and the rules and regulations promulgated under the Investment Company Act.\nIn addition, during the third quarter of 2014, we received a reimbursement of prior management fees paid to FIDAC of $24 million which did not recur in 2015.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u00b7 Either: \nEconomic Interest Expense and the Cost of Funds\nServicing Fees\nStock Buy Back\nLooking forward, we cannot predict the percentage of our assets that will be invested in each asset class or whether we will invest in other classes of investments. We may change our investment strategy and policies without a vote of our stockholders.\nThe Management Agreement\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including OTTI of Non-Agency RMBS, valuation of Agency and Non-Agency RMBS and interest rate swaps and income recognition on Non-Agency RMBS. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nIn addition to the principal sources of capital described above, we may enter into warehouse facilities and use longer dated structured repurchase agreements. The use of any particular source of capital and funds will depend on market conditions, availability of these facilities, and the investment opportunities available to us.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements under GAAP. Specifically, this guidance defines fair value based on exit price, or the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques for RMBS are based on models that consider the estimated cash flows expected to be collected from the underlying collateral and an estimated market-based yield reflective of the unique attributes of the tranche including, but not limited to, assumptions related to prepayment speeds, the frequency and severity of defaults and attributes of the collateral underlying such securities. Estimates of the fair value of RMBS are particularly sensitive to assumptions related to the expected timing of prepayments, the extent of defaults, and the severity of expected losses. Management reviews the fair values generated by the model to determine whether prices are reflective of the current market. Management indirectly corroborates its estimates of the fair value using pricing models by comparing its results to independent prices provided by third party pricing services.\n \u00b7 Limit the net income derived annually from its commodity interest positions that are not qualifying hedging transactions to less than five percent of the mortgage real estate investment trust's gross income; \nWe operate our business to be exempt from registration under the 1940 Act, and therefore we are required to invest a substantial majority of our assets in loans secured by mortgages on real estate and real estate-related assets. Subject to maintaining our REIT qualification and our 1940 Act exemption, we do not have any limitations on the amounts we may invest in any of our targeted asset classes.\nThe following table summarizes certain characteristics of our portfolio at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nWe also expect to meet our short term liquidity needs by relying on the cash flows generated by our investments. These cash flows are primarily comprised of monthly principal and interest payments received on our investments. We may also sell our investments and utilize those proceeds to meet our short term liquidity needs or enter into non-recourse financing of our assets through sales of securities to third parties of loan securitizations or RMBS re-securitization transactions, similar to transactions that we have completed in prior periods.\n\nThe Management Agreement provided that FIDAC would pay all past and future expenses that the Company or our Audit Committee incur to: (1) evaluate the Company's accounting policy related to the application of GAAP to its Non-Agency RMBS portfolio (the Evaluation\u201d); (2) restate the financial statements for the period covering 2008 through 2011 as a result of the Evaluation (the Restatement Filing\u201d); and (3) investigate and evaluate any shareholder derivative demands arising from the Evaluation or the Restatement Filing (the Investigation\u201d); provided, however, that the Manager's obligation to pay expenses applies only to expenses not paid by our insurers under our insurance policies. Expenses shall include, without limitation, fees and costs incurred with respect to auditors, outside counsel, and consultants engaged by us or our Audit Committee for the Evaluation, Restatement Filing and the Investigation. The amount paid by the Manager related to these expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is $7 million and $9 million, respectively. Recoveries are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as Expense recoveries from Manager.\nGeneral\nUnrealized gains and losses on our Agency and Non-Agency RMBS portfolio represent the changes in fair values of the securities from the prior period. Unrealized gains and losses on our entire Agency and Non-Agency RMBS portfolio are reflected in earnings. IO securities represent the right to receive the interest on a pool of mortgage backed securities, including both Agency and Non-Agency mortgage pools. The fair value of IO RMBS securities are heavily impacted by changes in expected prepayment rates. When IO securities prepay, the holder of the IO security will receive less interest on the investment due to the reduced principal. During the second quarter of 2015, we acquired residual interests in several seasoned pools of mortgage loans. These holdings generally do not have a traditional unpaid principal amount and pay cash based on guidance in the trust documents when excess cash is available. Many of these holdings do not pay any interest and may never pay interest. We have elected to carry these residual interests at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. As of January 1, 2015, the Company adopted the guidance in ASU 2014-13, Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity, which allowed us to carry both the assets and liabilities of certain consolidated VIEs at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.\nManagement Fees, Compensation, General and Administrative Expenses and Deal Expenses\nAt December 31, 2015, the difference between GAAP book value and estimated economic book value was $196 million, or $1.05 per share. At December 31, 2014, the difference between GAAP book value and estimated economic book value was $336 million, or $1.65 per share. This difference is primarily driven by the value of the RMBS assets we have retained in these re-securitization transactions as compared to the value of consolidated loans and securities net of RMBS assets sold, but treated as a secured financing on the statement of financial condition. In these re-securitization transactions, we have generally retained the subordinated, typically non-rated, first loss notes or certificates issued by the securitization trusts. These securities are complex, typically locked out as to principal repayment, relatively illiquid, and do not necessarily appreciate or depreciate in tandem with the broader Non-Agency RMBS market or with the loans on securities owned by the trusts. As the senior notes pay off, we expect the difference between our economic and our GAAP book value to decrease. The tables below present the adjustments to GAAP book value that we believe are necessary to adequately reflect our calculation of estimated economic book value as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe accounting models in ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40 are impacted by both assumptions of prepayments and assumptions of credit losses (defaults) and, accordingly, changes in the amounts of recorded interest income or OTTI losses over financial reporting periods cannot be considered to result solely from the impact of changes in the credit profile of the investment or solely from the impact of changes in prepayment speeds. Furthermore, while there may be some level of correlation between assumptions for defaults and prepayments as general market interest rates change, in the recent market conditions that correlation has not been direct or predictable.\nThe most critical judgment inherent in the determination of the appropriate accounting model is our assessment of the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date. In making this accounting judgment, we consider expected defaults and prepayments as further described below.\nExecutive Summary\nInterest expense increased by $111 million, or 76%, to $259 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $148 million for the same period of 2014. The increase is primarily due to increased interest expense of $95 million on our securitized debt collateralized by seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans due to the financing added for the acquisition of seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans during the second half of 2014 and in 2015. Interest expense on repurchase agreements increased by $33 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014, as repurchase agreements balances increased to finance both the Agency and Non-Agency portfolio. The interest rates were higher on repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency and Non-Agency MBS. The increase in interest rates for repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was driven by market factors and the increase in interest rates for repurchase agreements collateralized by Non-Agency MBS was driven by the addition of longer term repurchase agreements and anticipated increase in the federal funds rate. These increases were offset by a decline in interest expense of $23 million on our securitized debt, collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS and jumbo prime securitizations held in our consolidated VIEs as this portfolio continues to run-off.\nOur Agency RMBS are primarily financed with repurchase agreements. We secure our borrowings under these agreements by pledging our Agency RMBS as collateral to the lender. The collateral we pledge exceeds the amount of the borrowings under each agreement, typically with the extent of over-collateralization being at least 3% of the amount borrowed. If the counterparty to the repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations and we are not able to recover our pledged assets, we are at risk of losing the over-collateralized amount. The amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral.\nVariable Interest Entities\nUnrealized gains and losses include the change in market value, period over period, on our derivatives portfolio. Changes in market value are generally a result of changes in interest rates. The unrealized gains and losses of our derivatives portfolio are generally offset by net changes in our investment portfolio. We may or may not ultimately realize these unrealized derivative gains and losses depending on trade activity, changes in interest rates and the values of the underlying securities.\nThe interest rate environment over the last three years has been extremely volatile. During that period, we have experienced many fluctuations in the 10-year Treasury yield that have exceeded 50 basis points (0.50%) in a short timeframe. More broadly, the global fixed income, equity and commodity markets experienced market turbulence and increased volatility during 2015 as investors braced and waited for the Federal Reserve Bank to increase rates.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBecause we are unable to dispose of, monetize or pledge the RMBS or loans we transferred into the trusts, we also present our estimated economic book value. We believe this measure represents the estimated value of the securities issued by these trusts that we own. In contrast to GAAP book value, our estimated economic book value considers only the assets we own or are able to dispose of, pledge, or otherwise monetize. To determine our estimated economic book value, we consider only the fair value of the notes or certificates issued by the securitization and re-securitization trusts that we actually own. Accordingly, our estimated economic book value does not include assets or liabilities for which we have no direct ownership, specifically the notes or certificates of the securitization and re-securitization trusts that were sold to third parties.\nGains and Losses on Sales of Assets and Loss on extinguishment of securitized debt\nOur accounting policies for recognition of interest income and OTTI related to RMBS are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As noted therein, there are three different accounting models that may be applicable for purposes of the recognition of interest income and OTTI on RMBS, and include the following:\nWe hold our RMBS as available-for-sale, record these investments at estimated fair value as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, and include unrealized gains and losses considered to be temporary in Other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. From time to time, as part of the overall management of our portfolio, we may sell any of our RMBS investments and recognize a realized gain or loss as a component of earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income utilizing the specific identification method.\n\n\nWe collateralize the repurchase agreements we use to finance our operations with our MBS investments. Our counterparties negotiate a \u2018haircut' when we enter into a financing transaction, which varies from lender to lender. The size of the haircut reflects the perceived risk associated with holding the MBS by the lender. The haircut provides lenders with a cushion for daily market value movements that reduce the need for a margin call to be issued or margin to be returned as normal daily increases or decreases in MBS market values occur. At December 31, 2015, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Agency MBS was 5.3% compared to a haircut on Agency MBS of 5.1% at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements collateralized by Non-Agency MBS was 32.9% compared to a haircut on Non-Agency MBS of 29.4% at December 31, 2014.\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition contain the assets and liabilities related to seventeen consolidated variable interest entities, or VIEs. Due to the non-recourse nature of these VIEs our net exposure to loss from investments in these entities is limited to our retained beneficial interests.\nRestricted Stock Grants\nNon-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 or ASC 325-40 is generally purchased at a discount to the principal amount. At the original acquisition date, we estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected and calibrate the present value of those amounts to our purchase price. In each subsequent financial reporting period, we are required to revise our estimates of the remaining timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Depending on the nature of the changes in the timing or amount of cash flows expected to be collected, whether due to changes in default expectations or prepayment assumptions, the following will occur:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized net losses on derivatives of $115 million compared to net losses of $186 million for the same period of 2014. The net gains and losses on our derivatives include both unrealized and realized gains and losses. Realized gains and losses include the net cash paid and received on our interest rate swaps during the period as well as sales and settlements of our Treasury futures and mortgage options. The realized loss on our derivative instruments is primarily a result of the pay fixed leg of our swaps carried at a higher interest rate than the received floating leg of these same swaps resulting in a net payment on the periodic settlement of the swaps during the year. We also incurred realized losses on our treasury futures for the year ended 2014 as interest rates declined during the year, resulting in net payments to close out our future positions as they came due.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased by $4.3 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. Economic interest expense increased by $104 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities is a result of the increase in leverage from Agency and Non-Agency repurchase agreements and securitized debt entered during, 2015, offset by declines in our securitized debt collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS. The additional financing was used to increase our Agency RMBS and securitized residential mortgage loans. Our interest expense has increased due to the increase in average interest-bearing liabilities.\nWe granted 260,200 shares of restricted stock to employees of FIDAC and its affiliates and members of our Board of Directors on January 2, 2008. On February 2, 2015 we granted 84,700 shares of restricted stock to employees of FIDAC. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were approximately 71,000 and 39,400 unvested shares of restricted stock issued to our employees, respectively.\nInterest Income and Impairment on Non-Agency and Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities\nTo reduce the rate sensitivity of our Agency portfolio, we decreased our exposure to Agency MBS by more than $2.5 billion during 2015. We also sold Agency MBS with a 4% coupon for Agency MBS with a 3.5% coupon to mitigate prepayment risk as rates declined at certain points during 2015. At December 31, 2014, our portfolio of 4% Agency MBS was 75% of our total Agency MBS compared to 29% by December 31, 2015, while our portfolio of 3.5% Agency MBS increased from 18% at December 31, 2014 to 35% at December 31, 2015. We also significantly increased our Agency CMBS portfolio in 2015. We began the year with less than $250 million of Agency CMBS and increased this portfolio over $700 million to $952 million as of December 31, 2015. Our Agency CMBS portfolio is less interest rate sensitive than our Agency MBS portfolio because our Agency CMBS have lock out periods and prepayment penalties that protect the portfolio against prepayment risk, as well as attractive risk adjusted yields.\nG&A expenses were approximately $32 million, $20 million and $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in G&A expenses is primarily due to transition costs incurred as part of the Internalization of $9 million, which occurred during the second half of 2015. We also incurred deal expenses $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the call and re-securitization of certain of our subprime mortgage pools.\nBased on our calculations, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) and 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act.\nThe table below shows a summary of our net gain (loss) on derivative instruments, for the quarters ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nBased on our current portfolio, leverage ratio and available borrowing arrangements, we believe our assets will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short-term liquidity requirements. However, a decline in the value of our collateral could cause a temporary liquidity shortfall due to the timing of margin calls on the financing arrangements and the actual receipt of the cash related to principal paydowns. If our cash resources are at any time insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may have to sell investments, potentially at a loss, or issue debt or additional equity securities in a common stock offering.\nWe also have formed, and may in the future form, certain other wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that rely upon the exclusion from the definition of investment company under the Investment Company Act provided by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. The securities issued by any wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiary that relies on the exclusion from the definition of investment company provided by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7), together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis. We monitor our compliance with the 40% Test and the operations of our subsidiaries so that we and each of our subsidiaries may maintain compliance with an exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the determination of the appropriate accounting model for Non-Agency RMBS is dependent on management's assessment and judgment related to the following factors made as of the acquisition date:\nAs discussed above, on August 5, 2015, we entered into agreements to internalize our management. Prior to the Internalization, we were managed by FIDAC pursuant to the Management Agreement (the Management Agreement\u201d). In connection with the Internalization, we terminated the Management Agreement without the payment of any termination fee.\nFor our credit portfolio, we acquired, in the third quarter of 2014, the subordinate notes and call rights with respect to seven residential mortgage loan securitizations sponsored by Springleaf Financial. As planned, we exercised the calls rights to acquire the remaining residential mortgage loans, and then securitized those mortgage loans, for one of the Springleaf transactions in 2014 and for three of the Springleaf transactions that were eligible to be called in 2015. By exercising our call rights and securitizing the remaining mortgage loans, we were able to increase structural leverage while reducing interest costs on our investment in the mortgage loans. In addition, we executed one other securitization of seasoned subprime collateral in the second quarter of 2015.\n \u00b7 If there is a negative (or adverse) change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, and the securities' fair value is below its amortized cost, an OTTI loss equal to the adverse change in cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the securities' effective rate before impairment, is required to be recorded in current period earnings. For Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in future periods will decline because of the reduced balance of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied. Additionally, for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 325-40, while the effective interest rate used to accrete interest income during the period directly after an OTTI has been recognized will be the same, the amount of interest income recorded in such future period will decline, absent an increase in cash flows expected to be collected, because of the reduced amount of the amortized cost basis of the investment to which such effective interest rate is applied. An adverse change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has decreased from the most previous estimate. This change can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from increases in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, an adverse change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the negative impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults, or when the negative impact of an increase in estimated defaults exceeds the positive impact of a shortening of the timing of receipt of cash flows. \nIn determining the OTTI related to credit losses for Non-Agency RMBS securities accounted for under ASC 310-30 and ASC 325-40, we compare the present value of the remaining cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date (or last date previously revised) against the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected at the current financial reporting date. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows is the effective interest rate or effective yield used for income recognition purposes.\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 the remaining maturities on our RMBS repurchase agreements were as follows.\n \u00b7 If there is a positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes, the effective interest rate in future accounting periods may increase resulting in an increase in the reported amount of interest income in future periods. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected from the previous estimate used for accounting purposes must be considered significant for Non-Agency RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-30 for the effective interest rate in future accounting periods to increase. A positive change in the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected is considered to have occurred when the net present value of future cash flows expected to be collected has increased from the previous estimate. This can occur from a change in either the timing of when cash flows are expected to be collected (i.e., from changes in prepayment speeds or the timing of estimated defaults) or in the amount of cash flows expected to be collected (i.e., from reductions in estimates of future defaults). Furthermore, a positive change could occur on an overall basis in situations where the positive impact of a change in the timing of cash flows exceeds the negative impact of increased defaults, or when the positive impact of a decline in estimated defaults exceeds the negative impact of an extension of the timing of receipt of cash flows. \nTo the extent the inputs used to estimate fair value are observable, the values would be categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; otherwise they would be categorized as Level 3. The Company's fair value estimation process utilizes inputs other than quoted prices that are observed in the market. The Company's estimate of prepayment, default and severity curves all involve adjustments that are deemed to be significant to the fair value measurement process, which renders the resulting Non-Agency fair value estimates Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 assets represent approximately 55% and 49% of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Level 3 liabilities represent approximately 88% and 97%of total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. None of the liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 are Level 3.\nNet Economic Interest Income and the Average Earning Assets\nWe invest in RMBS representing interests in obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans. We delineate between (1) Agency RMBS and (2) Non-Agency RMBS as follows: The Agency RMBS are mortgage pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs\u201d), and other RMBS representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans issued or guaranteed as to principal and/or interest repayment by agencies of the U.S. Government or federally chartered corporations such as Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The Non-Agency RMBS are not issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae and are therefore subject to credit risk.\nOTTI losses are generated when fair values decline below our amortized cost basis, an unrealized loss, and the expected future cash flows decline from prior periods, an adverse change. When an unrealized loss and an adverse change in cash flows occur, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings. In addition, if we intend to sell a security, or believe we will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, we will recognize an OTTI loss in earnings equal to the unrealized loss.\nWe also use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risks. Under these swap agreements, we pledge Agency RMBS or cash as collateral as part of a margin arrangement for interest rate swaps that are in an unrealized loss position. If swap counterparty were to default on its obligation, we would be exposed to a loss to the extent that the amount of our Agency RMBS pledged exceeded the unrealized loss on the associated swaps and we were not able to recover the excess collateral.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 15 of this 2015 Form 10-K. The discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical in nature. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this 2015 Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nWe held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $114 million and $165 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. As a result of our operating, investing and financing activities described above, our cash position decreased by $51 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\n \u00b7 Our assessment of whether the security can be contractually prepaid such that we would not recover our initial investment. \nWe have engaged in transactions with residential mortgage lending operations of leading commercial banks and other originators in which we identified and re-underwrote residential mortgage loans owned by such entities, and purchased and securitized such residential mortgage loans. In the past we have also acquired formerly AAA-rated Non-Agency RMBS and immediately re-securitized those securities. We sold the resulting AAA-rated super senior RMBS and retained the rated or unrated mezzanine and subordinate RMBS.\nPortfolio Review\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income (subject to certain adjustments). We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Before we pay any dividend, we must first meet any operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our financing facilities and other debt payable.\nCore earnings\nInterest Income\nInterest Expense\nBased on the projected cash flows for our Non-Agency RMBS that are not of high credit quality, a portion of the original purchase discount is designated as Accretable Discount, which reflects the purchase discount expected to be accreted into interest income, and a portion is designated as Non-Accretable Difference, which represents the contractual principal on the security that is not expected to be collected. The amount designated as Non-Accretable Difference may be adjusted over time, based on the actual performance of the security, its underlying collateral, actual and projected cash flow from such collateral, economic conditions and other factors. If the performance of a security is more favorable than previously estimated, a portion of the amount designated as Non-Accretable Difference may be accreted into interest income over time. Conversely, if the performance of a security is less favorable than previously estimated, an OTTI may be recognized resulting in an increase in the amounts designated as Non-Accretable Difference.\nWe are a REIT primarily engaged in the business of investing, on a leveraged basis, in a diversified portfolio of mortgage assets, including Agency RMBS, Non-Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS, residential mortgage loans, and real estate related securities. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return.\nThe following table presents changes to Accretable Discount and Non-Accretable Difference as it pertains to our entire Non-Agency RMBS portfolio for assets with purchase discounts during the previous five quarters.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we declared dividends to common shareholders totaling $379 million, or $1.92 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we declared dividends to common shareholders totaling $370 million, or $1.80 per share.\nASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (ASC 310-30) - applies to Non-Agency RMBS where there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality and we do not expect to collect all contractual cash flows of the security.\n\nOur investing activities provided cash of approximately $2.0 billion, used cash of $6.1 billion and provided cash of $305 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we purchased investments of $7.7 billion, primarily Agency RMBS. This use of cash was offset during the year from sales of investments of $7.7 billion and principal repayments of $2.2 billion. The purchases and sales activity was primarily due to our continuing to balance our Agency portfolio to maximize spread income and provide liquidity for purchases of Non-Agency RMBS and mortgage loan pools. During the year ended December 31, 2014 we purchased investments of $12.1 billion, primarily Agency RMBS and securitized loans. This use of cash was offset during the period from sales of investments of $5.6 billion and principal repayments of $1.2 billion during 2014. Additionally, during 2014, we used cash of $774 million to acquire interests in a group of trusts collateralized by pools of seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans. During the year ended December 31, 2013 we generated cash from sales of RMBS investments of $1.2 billion and principal payments of $1.5 billion related to all our investment assets offset by purchases of $2.4 billion in RMBS securities.\nOur assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value are discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRefer to Note 2(p) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of accounting guidance recently adopted by the Company or expected to be adopted by the Company in the future.\nInterest income increased by $176 million, or 34%, to $688 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $512 million for the same period of 2013. The increase is primarily due to the increase in agency holdings of approximately $6.4 billion acquired during 2014 and the increase in securitized loans of approximately $4.5 billion also acquired during 2014. Interest income on our Agency RMBS portfolio increased by $110 million and interest income on our securitized loan portfolio increased by $100 million. Both portfolios increased from the prior year due to acquisitions during 2014 financed by additional repurchase agreements and secured debt as we increased our leverage ratio during 2014.The increases are partially offset by a decline in interest income on our Non-Agency portfolio of $34 million year over year as natural principal payments and expected losses have reduced the interest earning balance of these assets.\nWe have organized ourselves as a holding company and conduct our real estate businesses primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries and at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. If we were to become regulated as an investment company, our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced.\nDuring this volatile market period, we have continued to acquire investments that we believe provide a risk-adjusted return and income that support the dividend that we distribute to our investors.\nWe have elected and believe we are organized and have operated in a manner that qualifies us to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. A REIT generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. Furthermore, substantially all of our assets consist of qualified REIT real estate assets (of the type described in Code Section 856(c)(5)). We calculate that at least 75% of our assets were qualified REIT assets, as defined in the Code, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We also calculate that our revenues qualified for the 75% REIT income test and for the 95% REIT income test for years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. We also met all REIT requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our REIT taxable income. Therefore, as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we believe that we qualified as a REIT under the Code.\nWhile we disagree that the CFTC's position that mortgage real estate investment trusts that use swaps as part of their business model fall within the statutory definition of a CPO, we have submitted a claim for the relief set forth in the no-action relief entitled No-Action Relief from the Commodity Pool Operator Registration Requirement for Commodity Pool Operators of Certain Pooled Investment Vehicles Organized as Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts\u201d and believe we meet the criteria for such relief set forth therein.\n\n\nAccounting policies are integral to understanding our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions, on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements. Our significant accounting policies and accounting estimates are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies are described in this section. An accounting policy is considered critical if it requires management to make assumptions or judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made or require significant management judgment in interpreting the accounting literature. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, or other accounting judgments were made, this could have a significant and potentially adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These critical accounting policies were developed by management, and reviewed by our auditors, prior to being presented to and discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nNet Economic Interest Income\nOver the past several years, several large European financial institutions have experienced financial difficulty and have been either rescued by government assistance or by other large European banks or institutions. Some of these financial institutions or their U.S. subsidiaries have provided us financing under repurchase agreements or we have entered into interest rate swaps with such institutions. We have entered into repurchase agreements or interest rate swaps with six counterparties as of December 31, 2015 that is either domiciled in Europe or is a U.S.-based subsidiary of a European-domiciled financial institution. The following table summarizes our exposure to such counterparties at December 31, 2015:\nDividends\nTo meet our longer term liquidity needs (greater than one year), we expect our principal sources of capital and funds to continue to be provided by earnings from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities, as well as proceeds from equity offerings.\n \nNet Income Summary\nOur investment strategy is intended to take advantage of opportunities in the current interest rate and credit environment. We expect to adjust our strategy to changing market conditions by shifting our asset allocations across these various asset classes as interest rate and credit cycles change over time. We believe that our strategy will enable us to pay dividends and achieve capital appreciation throughout changing market cycles. We expect to take a long-term view of assets and liabilities, and our reported earnings and estimates of the fair value of our investments at the end of a financial reporting period will not significantly impact our objective of providing attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long-term.\nThe following table presents details of each asset class in our portfolio at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The principal or notional value represents the interest income earning balance of each class. The weighted average figures are weighted by each investment's respective principal/notional value in the asset class.\nNet Income (Loss) and Return on Average Equity\nCore earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income excluding unrealized gains on the aggregate portfolio, impairment losses, realized gains on sales of investments, realized gains or losses on futures, realized gains or losses on swap terminations, gain on deconsolidation, extinguishment of debt and certain other non-recurring gains or losses. As defined, core earnings include interest income and expense as well as realized losses on interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk. Core earnings are provided for the purpose of comparability to other peer issuers, but have important limitations. Core earnings as described above helps evaluate our financial performance without the impact of certain transactions and is of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, core earnings should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net income or net income per basic share computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOther Matters\nASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (ASC 325-40) - applies to certain Non-Agency RMBS not within the scope of ASC 310-20 or ASC 310-30. These include Non-Agency RMBS which is not of high credit quality at the time of purchase or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that we would not recover substantially all of our recorded investment.\n o identify itself as a mortgage REIT\u201d in Item G of its last U.S. income tax return on Form 1120-REIT; or \nThis Management Discussion and Analysis section contains analysis and discussion of financial information that utilizes or presents ratios based on GAAP book value. The table and discussion below present our estimated economic book value. We calculate and disclose this non-GAAP measurement because we believe it represents an estimate of the fair value of the assets we own or are able to dispose of, pledge, or otherwise monetize. The estimated economic book value should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for book value computed in accordance with GAAP.\nSecured Debt Financing Transactions\nOur estimate of economic book value has important limitations. Our estimate of fair value is as of a point in time and subject to significant judgment, primarily the estimate of the fair value of the securities issued by the trusts which we own and can freely sell or pledge. Should we sell the assets in our portfolio, we may realize materially different proceeds from the sale than we have estimated as of the reporting date.\nOur net income was $250 million, $589 million and $363 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Economic net interest income as a percentage of average equity increased by 164 basis point at December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. Return on average equity decreased by 541 basis point for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014 due to lower income in the year 2015, primarily as a result of unrealized losses on financial instruments at fair value.\n\nTo meet our short term (one year or less) liquidity needs, we expect to continue to borrow funds in the form of repurchase agreements and, subject to market conditions, other types of financing. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our master repurchase agreements generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or SIFMA, as to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all securities we have initially sold under the repurchase transaction. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, cross default provisions, required haircuts (or the percentage that is subtracted from the value of RMBS that collateralizes the financing), purchase price maintenance requirements, and requirements that all disputes related to the repurchase agreement be litigated or arbitrated in a particular jurisdiction. These provisions may differ for each of our lenders.\n\nOTTI losses were $67 million, $64 million and $45 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Of these amounts, $58 million, $59 million and $38 million of the OTTI for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was related to securities included in our consolidated VIEs. As of December 31, 2015, we had 26 non-agency RMBS securities subject to OTTI in an unrealized loss position totaling $10 million for which we did not recognize impairment. We intend to hold these securities until they recover their amortized cost. We continue to monitor our investment portfolio and will record an OTTI for all investments in an unrealized loss position for which we do not believe we will recover our amortized cost prior to maturity or sale.\nThe table below shows our economic net interest income, realized gains (losses) on sale of assets and the credit related OTTI, realized and unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps and IOs, total management fee and G&A expenses, and income tax, each as a percentage of average equity, and the return on average equity for the periods presented.\nDuring the year of 2015, we decreased our leverage as we sold portions of our Agency MBS portfolio to generate liquidity to settle repurchase agreements as well as to acquire a pool of mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015, we had repurchase agreements with 24 counterparties. All of our repurchase agreements are secured by Agency and Non-Agency RMBS or, in limited circumstances, cash. Under these repurchase agreements we may not be able to reclaim our collateral but still be obligated to pay our repurchase obligations. We mitigate this risk by limiting our exposure to any counterparty to approximately 10% or less of our total equity, as well as ensuring all our counterparties are highly rated. Therefore, we believe the risk of loss of our collateral posted is mitigated by the terms of our agreements. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $8.8 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively, of securities pledged against our repurchase agreement obligations.\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions will be determined by our Board of Directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to maintain our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and financial condition are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation.\n \u00b7 Our assessment of the probability of collection of all contractual cash flows. \n\nThe following tables summarize our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The estimated principal repayment schedule of the securitized debt is based on expected cash flows of the residential mortgage loans or RMBS, as adjusted for expected principal writedowns on the underlying collateral of the debt.\nCapital Expenditure Requirements\nAs a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, gained jurisdiction over the regulation of interest rate swaps. The CFTC has asserted that this causes the operators of mortgage real estate investment trusts that use swaps as part of their business model to fall within the statutory definition of Commodity Pool Operator, or CPO, and, absent relief from the Division or the Commission, to register as CPOs. On December 7, 2012, as a result of numerous requests for no-action relief from the CPO registration requirement for operators of mortgage real estate investment trusts, the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight of the CFTC issued no-action relief entitled No-Action Relief from the Commodity Pool Operator Registration Requirement for Commodity Pool Operators of Certain Pooled Investment Vehicles Organized as Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts\u201d that permits a CPO to receive relief by filing a claim to perfect the use of the relief. A claim submitted by a CPO will be effective upon filing, so long as the claim is materially complete. The conditions that must be met to claim the relief are that the mortgage real estate investment trust must:\n\nWe discuss the changes in our net income in greater detail in the discussion on our results of operations below.\nInvestment Portfolio\nChanges in actual prepayments will impact the amount of interest income recognized in each financial reporting period for RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20. We estimate expected prepayment as further described below.\n\nBusiness Environment\nFinancial Condition\nIn connection with the Internalization and the termination of the Management Agreement, we became internally managed and hired employees. Thus, as of August 5, 2015, we began to incur compensation and benefits costs. Compensation and benefits costs have replaced the management fee as the cost to operate our business. Compensation and benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11 million.\n\nEstimated Economic Book Value\nFor re-securitized RMBS transactions and loan securitizations, we present the pre-securitized assets transferred into the consolidated trusts in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Non-Agency or Securitized loans held for investment. Post securitization RMBS assets sold are presented as liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Securitized debt, collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS and Securitized debt, collateralized by loans held for investment. We have presented the underlying securities we transferred to the trusts for the calculation of GAAP book value at fair value and recorded the corresponding liability for the notes or certificates sold to third parties at amortized cost or fair value. Fair value adjustments that are not credit related are recorded in Other comprehensive income. Credit related impairments are deemed other-than-temporary and are recorded in earnings.\nNet realized gains on sales of investments were $77 million, $92 million and $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We do not forecast sales of investments as we generally expect to invest for long term gains. However, from time to time, we may sell assets to create liquidity necessary to pursue new opportunities, achieve targeted leverage ratios as well as for gains when prices indicate a sale is most beneficial to us, or is the most prudent course of action to maintain a targeted risk adjusted yield for our investors.\nThe determination of which accounting model to apply will have a significant impact on the amounts of interest income and OTTI losses reflected in the results of operations because each accounting model has different requirements regarding the cash flows used to calculate interest income and impairments (i.e., contractual cash flows vs. expected cash flows) and the manner of such calculations, and the impact of changes in prepayment assumptions on interest income or OTTI losses.\nImpact of prepayment assumptions on RMBS accounted for under ASC 310-20\n\nInterest expense for GAAP reporting does not include the periodic costs of our derivatives, which are reported separately.\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities.\nWe focus our investment activities primarily on acquiring Non-Agency and Agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, ( MBS\u201d), and on purchasing residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 46% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS, 20% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, and 34% of our investment portfolio was securitized residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2014, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 52% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS, 16% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, and 32% of our investment portfolio was securitized residential mortgage loans.\n\nUse of Estimates\nWe had no preferred stock issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n o if it has not yet filed its first U.S. income tax return on Form 1120-REIT, disclose to its shareholders that it intends to identify itself as a mortgage REIT\u201d in its first U.S. income tax return on Form 1120-REIT. \nInflation\nThe table below presents our average daily repurchase balance and the repurchase balance at each period end for the periods presented. Our balance at period-end tends to fluctuate from the average daily balances due to the adjusting of the size of our portfolio by using leverage. Our average repurchase agreement balance for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to our average repurchase agreement balance for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to additional borrowings on our repurchase agreements in excess of repayments during 2015. We continue to deploy capital for strategic purchases of investments.\nBusiness Operations\nLiquidity measures our ability to meet cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay our borrowings, purchase RMBS, mortgage loans and other assets for our portfolio, pay dividends and other general business needs. Our principal sources of capital and funds for additional investments primarily include earnings from our investments, borrowings under securitizations and re-securitizations, repurchase agreements and other financing facilities, and proceeds from equity offerings.\nCurrent Period\nGAAP requires us to consolidate certain securitizations and re-securitization transactions where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. In these transactions, we transfer assets to the trusts, which issue tranches of senior and subordinate notes or certificates. We sell the senior tranches and therefore have no continuing involvement in these trusts other than being a holder of notes or certificates issued by the trusts, with the same rights as other holders of the notes or certificates. However, with respect to certain VIEs collateralized by loans held for investment, we have the ability to approve loan modifications and determine the course of action to be taken as it relates to loans in technical default, including whether or not to proceed with foreclosure. The notes and certificates we own that were issued by the trusts are largely subordinated interests in those trusts. The trusts have no recourse to our assets other than pursuant to a breach by us of the transaction documents related to the transfer of the assets by us to the trusts, but are presented as if we own 100% of the trust.\nOur primary source of income is interest income earned on our assets. Our economic net interest income equals interest income excluding interest earned on cash and cash equivalents less interest expense and realized losses on our interest rate hedges.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDue to the consolidation of these VIEs, our actual ownership interests in the securitization and re-securitizations have been eliminated in consolidation and the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition reflect both the assets held and non-recourse debt issued to third parties by these VIEs. In addition, our operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts related to the assets and liabilities of the VIEs as opposed to the actual economic interests we own in these VIEs. Our interest in these VIEs is restricted to the beneficial interests we retained in these transactions. We are not obligated to provide any financial support to these VIEs.\n\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe are not required to maintain any specific debt-to-equity ratio. We believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality and risk of those assets. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 our total debt was approximately $11.7 billion and $13.6 billion which represented a debt-to-equity ratio for both periods of approximately 4.0:1 and 3.8:1, respectively. We include our repurchase agreements and securitized debt in the numerator of our debt-to-equity ratio and stockholders' equity as the denominator.\n \u00b7 Our assessment of the credit quality of the asset, including its credit rating at the acquisition date and whether the security has experienced deterioration in credit quality since its inception. \nInterest income increased by $185 million, or 27%, to $873 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $688 million for the same period of 2014. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loan pools during the second half of 2014 and 2015. Seasoned sub-prime residential mortgage loans contributed $288 million of interest income during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $104 million for the same period of 2014. In addition we also increased our agency holdings which contributed an additional $12 million in interest income for the year as compared to 2014. These increases were offset by a decline in interest income of $38 million on our Non-Agency RMBS and jumbo prime securitizations held in consolidated VIEs as these portfolios continue to run-off.\nOur economic net interest income equals interest income, less interest expense and realized losses on our interest rate swaps. Realized losses on our interest rate swaps are the periodic net settlement payments made or received. For the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures throughout this section, interest expense includes net payments on our interest rate swaps, which is presented as a part of Realized gains (losses) on derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest rate swaps are used to manage the increase in interest paid on repurchase agreements in a rising rate environment. Presenting the net contractual interest payments on interest rate swaps with the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities reflects our total contractual interest payments. We believe this presentation is useful to investors because it depicts the economic value of our investment strategy by showing actual interest expense and net interest income. Where indicated, interest expense, including interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic interest expense. Where indicated, net interest income reflecting interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic net interest income.\nOur net income decreased by $339 million to $250 million, or $1.25 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $589 million, or $2.87 per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest income increased by $185 million, or 27%, to $873 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $688 million for the same period of 2014. This increase in interest income was offset by an increase of $111 million in interest expense to $259 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $148 million for the same period of 2014. This resulted in an overall increase of $73 million in net interest income, year over year as we have continued to rebalance our portfolio to more Non-Agency holdings with higher costs of financing, but higher interest returns.\nThe overall decrease in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period of 2014 is attributable primarily to an increase in net unrealized losses on financial instruments at fair value of $352 million. The Company recognized an unrealized loss for the year ended 2015 of $158 million, compared to an unrealized gain on financial instruments at fair value of $194 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. A significant portion of our financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. This can result in significant changes in net income as prices change as a result of changes in market conditions.\nServicing fees paid by our consolidated VIEs were approximately $25 million, $10 million and $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These servicing fees are related to the consolidation of the whole loan securitization vehicles and are paid from interest income earned by the VIEs. The increase in servicing fees is primarily due to the addition of subprime mortgage loans from the prior year. Subprime mortgage loans average asset balance increased to $4.5 billion for year ended December 31, 2015 from $1.4 billion for the same period of 2014.\nInterest expense increased by $46 million, or 45%, to $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $102 million for the same period of 2013. The increase is primarily due to increased interest expense of $24 million on our securitized debt and $21 million on our repurchase agreements. During 2014, we increased leverage to finance additional investments in Agency RMBS, Non-Agency RMBS, as well as securitized loans held for investment. Our repurchase agreement obligation increased by $6.8 billion to $8.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 as compared to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2013.\nThe consolidated financial statements include, on a consolidated basis, our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities, or VIEs, for which we are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nAt December 31, 2015, we did not use credit default swaps or other forms of credit protection to hedge the exposures summarized in the table above.\nOur operating activities provided net cash of approximately $396 million, 183 million and $305 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The cash provided by our operations is primarily due to interest received in excess of interest paid during the period. During 2015, interest received net of interest paid was $645 million. This cash received was offset in part by payments on derivatives of $158 million, including $99 million paid for termination of existing swaps during the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2014, interest received net of interest paid was $466 million. During 2014, we paid cash to cover margin requirements on our interest rate swaps and other financial instruments of approximately $186 million, which is primarily reflected in other assets and other payments from derivative sales and settlements during the year ended December 31, 2014. The cash provided by operating activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to prior year due primarily to a decrease in interest collected on the portfolio, net of interest paid, of $61 million, offset in part by lower management fees paid during 2013 as compared to prior year.\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nOur financing activities used cash of $2.5 billion, provided cash of $5.7 billion and used cash of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid proceeds on our repurchase agreements, net of proceeds received on our repurchase agreements of $1.0 billion. We also repaid principal of our securitized debt of $2.3 billion and paid dividends of $381 million. Additionally, during the second half of 2015, we also paid $250 million to repurchase common stock outstanding. These uses of cash were offset, in part, by receipt of cash on debt issuance of $1.5 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received proceeds on our repurchase agreements, net of repayments on our repurchase agreements of $6.8 billion and received proceeds from securitized debt borrowings of $392 million. These proceeds were offset by payments and repurchases on our securitized debt of $583 million and payments of dividends of $575 million. The payments of dividends during the year ended December 31, 2014 includes the $205 million of special dividends announced in the fourth quarter of 2013, but paid during the first quarter of 2014. The year ended December 31, 2013 reflected payments on securitized debt borrowings of $914 million, payment of dividends of $370 million and proceeds from repurchase agreements, net of payments on repurchase agreements, of $131 million.\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td>

This resulted in lower management fees but higher compensation and G&A expenses.\n\n- The company declared $379 million in dividends in 2015 compared to $370 million in 2014.\n\n- Estimated economic book value was lower than GAAP book value, mainly due to consolidation of VIEs required by GAAP.\n\n- Leverage remained stable at around 4.0x debt-to-equity.\n\n- Annaly remains focused on managing interest rate risk and shifting its portfolio allocation to target attractive risk-adjusted returns for shareholders."}
