MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe MD&A generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020, as well as year-to-year discussions between 2021, 2020, and 2019, where indicated. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations\u201d in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 31, 2021.\nBusiness Overview:\nWe are a vertically integrated Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency infrastructure development company principally engaged in enhancing our capabilities to mine Bitcoin. We also provide the critical mining infrastructure for our institutional scale clients to mine Bitcoin at our Bitcoin mining facility (the Whinstone Facility\u201d). Our Whinstone Facility is believed to be the largest Bitcoin mining facility, as measured by developed capacity, in North America.\nWe operate in an environment which is consistently evolving based on the proliferation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. A significant component of our strategy is to effectively and efficiently allocate capital between opportunities that generate the highest return on capital.\nWe operate in three business segments: (1) Bitcoin Mining ( Mining\u201d), (2) Data Center Hosting ( Hosting\u201d), and (3) Electrical Products and Engineering ( Engineering\u201d).\nStrategic Acquisitions\nWhinstone\nOn May 26, 2021, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Whinstone US, Inc. ( Whinstone\u201d) pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, dated as of April 8, 2021, we entered into with Northern Data AG ( Northern Data\u201d) and Whinstone (the Whinstone Acquisition\u201d). At the closing of the Whinstone Acquisition, we paid to Northern Data $80 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the stock purchase agreement, and issued to Northern Data 11.8 million shares of our common stock. We also entered into a shareholder agreement with Northern Data on the closing date granting Northern Data certain registration rights whereby we registered the 11.8 million shares issued to Northern Data as part of the Whinstone Acquisition. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, there were no registration rights obligations to Northern Data.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>32\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAfter closing the Whinstone Acquisition, we announced a large-scale expansion of the Whinstone Facility by 400 MW, which is anticipated to bring the Whinstone Facility to 700 MW in total capacity of Bitcoin mining infrastructure. The expansion of the Whinstone Facility will provide us with the necessary infrastructure to operate our miners efficiently, and deploy our future miners, as well as provide additional expansion opportunities in our Hosting business.\nESS Metron\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity interests (the ESS Metron Acquisition\u201d) of Ferrie Franzmann Industries, LLC (d/b/a ESS Metron) ( ESS Metron\u201d). At the closing of the ESS Metron Acquisition, we issued to the sellers $25 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the membership interest purchase agreement, and 715,413 shares of our common stock, subject to a holdback of 70,165 shares as security for the sellers' indemnification obligations under the membership interest purchase agreement. We also granted the sellers certain registration rights relating to the resale by the sellers of the shares issued to them under the membership interest purchase agreement, among other things. Pursuant to these registration rights, we registered the resale of the 645,248 shares issued to the sellers at the closing of the ESS Metron Acquisition pursuant to the prospectus supplement we filed with the SEC on December 1, 2021 under our effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on August 31, 2021 (File No. 333-259212). These registration rights also apply to the 70,165 holdback shares withheld at closing of the ESS Metron Acquisition, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to their release, as set forth in the membership interest purchase agreement. Accordingly, as provided in the membership interest purchase agreement, we will be obligated to register under the Securities Act the resale of the holdback shares that are ultimately issued to the sellers.\nESS Metron is one of the world's leading designers and manufacturers of power distribution equipment. The acquisition of ESS Metron provides critical infrastructure electrical components and engineering expertise to facilitate the expansion of our Whinstone Facility, as well as future strategic growth initiatives we may undertake. ESS Metron has also been instrumental in the design, manufacture, and implementation of our industrial-scale immersion-cooled Bitcoin mining hardware at our Whinstone Facility.\n2022 Trends\nWe anticipate that 2022 will be a year of consolidation in the Bitcoin mining industry, and we believe that, given our relative position in the competitive landscape, we are likely positioned to benefit from this consolidation. As a result of any strategic action undertaken by us, our business and financial results may change significantly. We are continuously evaluating strategic opportunities we may decide to undertake as part of our strategic growth initiatives; however, we can offer no assurances that any strategic opportunities we decide to undertake will be achieved on the schedule or within the budget we anticipate, if at all, in our competitive and evolving industry. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for additional discussion regarding potential impacts our competitive and evolving industry may have on our business.\nBitcoin Mining\nAt December 31, 2021, our Mining business operated approximately 30,907 ASIC miners, with a hash rate capacity of 3.1 exahash per second ( EH/s\u201d), utilizing approximately 96 megawatts ( MW\u201d) of capacity. In 2021, we mined 3,812 Bitcoin, which represented an increase of 269% over the 1,033 Bitcoin we mined in 2020. Based on our existing operations and expected deliveries of miners pursuant to our purchase orders with their manufacturer, Bitmain, we anticipate we will have approximately 120,150 miners in operation, utilizing approximately 370 MW of capacity by the end of 2022.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>33\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMiner Purchases and Deployments\nAt December 31, 2021, we had purchased, received and/or deployed the following miners:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of miners </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Miners deployed at January 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,043 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Miners received and deployed during the year ended December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,864 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Miners received during the year ended December 31, 2021, but not yet deployed </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,744 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Miners under contract, but not yet received </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total miners under contract, expected to be received, or deployed at December 31, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,146 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2021, we received 34,608 additional Antminer model S19-Pro miners pursuant to purchase orders with their manufacturer, Bitmain, and, as of December 31, 2021, we had deployed a total of 30,907 miners in our Mining operation. Additionally, we executed six additional purchase orders with Bitmain to acquire 43,500 Antminer model S19j (90 Terahash per second) ( TH/s\u201d)) miners, and 9,000 Antminer model S19j-Pro (100 TH/s) miners, and 30,000 of Bitmain's latest generation Antminer model S19XP (140 TH/s) miners, for a combined total purchase price of approximately $535.0 million. Pursuant to these agreements, approximately $301.3 million remains payable to Bitmain in installments in advance of shipment of the miners, which is scheduled to occur on a monthly basis through December 2022.\nData Center Hosting\nUpon completion of the Whinstone Acquisition, we commenced an expansion of our Whinstone Facility to 700 MW, from its existing 300 MW of developed capacity. We expect the expanded Whinstone Facility to be completed during 2022, including the construction of four new dedicated Bitcoin mining buildings totaling approximately 240,000 square feet of finished hosting space. Upon completion, we anticipate our Whinstone Facility will possess sufficient developed electricity power capacity to support an estimated 112,000 Antminer model S19j miners based upon current configurations. We believe the expansion of our Whinstone Facility will provide sufficient capacity to enable us to deploy a significant quantity of our miners (including our current deployed fleet and those expected to be delivered in future shipments pursuant to our purchase orders with Bitmain) in a self-hosted facility, while allowing Whinstone to continue to operate and grow its existing Hosting business. We believe deploying our miners at the expanded Whinstone Facility has many advantages for our mining operations, including allowing us to operate our miners without incurring third-party colocation services fees and to do so at the fixed low energy costs available to the Whinstone Facility under its long-term power supply agreement. We also anticipate this expansion of the Whinstone Facility will provide space for third-party miner colocation services and for other enterprise-level data center hosting services.\nWhinstone currently hosts Bitcoin mining operations for institutional-scale mining customers. In addition to Hosting revenue from customers, Whinstone also generates, as part of its Hosting revenue, construction services revenue from hosting customers on site, including revenue derived from the fabrication and deployment of immersion-cooling technology for Bitcoin mining.\nFrom the May 26, 2021 acquisition date through December 31, 2021, Hosting revenue and net income was approximately $24.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Additionally, the majority of our $22.6 million of deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 is related to advance payments made by Whinstone customers, which will be primarily recognized over the remaining lives of the underlying contracts, or approximately eight years.\nElectrical Products and Engineering\nThe Acquisition of ESS Metron provides us with the ability to vertically integrate many of the critical electrical components and engineering services necessary for our Whinstone expansion. A key component of our strategy is to integrate the expertise of the ESS Metron team, which we believe is necessary to reduce our execution and counter-party risk in ongoing and future expansion projects. ESS Metron's engineers will also allow us to continue to explore new methods to optimize and develop a best-in-class Bitcoin mining operation, and they have been instrumental in the development of our industrial-scale immersion-cooled Bitcoin mining hardware. ESS Metron also has an existing electricity distribution product design, manufacture, and installation business primarily focused on large-scale commercial and governmental customers.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td>34\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has been unpredictable and unprecedented and is likely to continue to result in significant national and global economic disruption, which may adversely affect our business. Based on our current assessment, however, we do not expect any material impact on our long-term development, our operations, or our liquidity due to the worldwide spread of COVID-19, other than the potential impacts of COVID-19 on global logistics discussed below. We are actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, and industry.\nGlobal Logistics\nGlobal supply logistics have caused delays across all channels of distribution. Similarly, we have also experienced delays in certain of our miner delivery schedules. During 2021, we have been able to effectively mitigate any delivery delays to avoid materially impacting our miner deployment schedule, however, there are no assurances we will be able to continue to mitigate any such delivery delays in 2022. Additionally, the scale of the Whinstone expansion requires large quantities of specific materials. We have procured and hold many of the required materials to help mitigate against global supply logistic and pricing concerns. We monitor developments in the global supply chain and how that may potentially impact our expansion plans. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of our Annual Report for additional discussion regarding potential impacts the global supply chain crisis may have on our operations and plans for expansion.\nSummary of Mining Results\nThe following table presents additional information about our Mining activities, including cryptocurrency production and sales of the cryptocurrency the Company mined during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 ($ in thousands):\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Quantities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in coins) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance at January 1, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue recognized from cryptocurrencies mined </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,741 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mining pool operating fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(135 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase of miner equipment with cryptocurrencies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(99 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Proceeds from sale of cryptocurrencies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(585 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,196 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized gain on sale/exchange of cryptocurrencies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>665 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment of cryptocurrencies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(844 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance at December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,839 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue recognized from cryptocurrencies mined </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,984 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mining pool operating fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(146 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Proceeds from sale of cryptocurrencies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(500 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,298 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized gain on sale/exchange of cryptocurrencies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,184 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment of cryptocurrencies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(989 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cryptocurrencies received from sale of equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance at December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,626 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue recognized from cryptocurrencies mined </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,422 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Proceeds from sale of cryptocurrencies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(295 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized gain on sale/exchange of cryptocurrencies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>253 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment of cryptocurrencies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,462 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance at December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,544 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>35\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations Comparative Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nRevenues:\nTotal revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $213.2 million and $12.1 million, respectively, and consisted of our Mining revenue, Hosting revenue, Engineering revenue, and other revenue.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Mining revenue was $184.4 million, and $12.0 million, respectively. The increase of $172.4 million in mining revenue was due to higher Bitcoin values in the 2021 period, averaging $45,744 per coin as compared to $11,461 per coin in the 2020 period, combined with a higher number of Bitcoin mined in 2021, which totaled 3,812, as compared to 1,033 in the 2020 period.\nFor the period from the acquisition of Whinstone on May 26, 2021 to December 31, 2021, Hosting revenue was $24.5 million, and there was no Hosting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Hosting revenue includes upfront payments, which we record as deferred revenue and generally recognize as services are provided. We provide energized space and operating and maintenance services to third-party mining companies who locate their mining hardware at our Whinstone Facility under long-term contracts. We account for these agreements as a single performance obligation for services being delivered in a series with delivery being measured by daily successful operation of the mining hardware. As such, we recognize revenue over the life of the contract as its series of performance obligations are met. The contracts are recognized in the amount for which we have the right to invoice because we elected the right to invoice\u201d practical expedient.\nFor the period from the acquisition of ESS Metron on December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, Engineering revenue was $4.2 million, and there was no Engineering revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Engineering revenue is derived from the sale of custom products built to customers' specifications under fixed-price contracts with one identified performance obligation. Engineering revenues are recognized over time as performance creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and for which the Company has an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract.\nOther revenue consisting of license fees earned from our legacy animal bioscience business was not significant in either period.\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenues for Mining for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $45.5 million and $6.3 million, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $39.2 million. As a percentage of Mining revenue, cost of revenues totaled 24.7% and 52.2% for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cost of revenues consist primarily of direct production costs of mining operations, including electricity, labor, insurance and, in 2020, rent for the Oklahoma City facility and, in 2021, the variable Coinmint hosting fee, but excluding depreciation and amortization which are separately stated. The increase of $39.2 million in cost of revenues is primarily due to the increases in variable mining costs, including the variable hosting fees associated with increases in mining revenues.\nCost of revenues for Hosting for the period from the acquisition of Whinstone on May 26, 2021 to December 31, 2021 was $33.0 million and there were no Hosting costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 2021 costs consisted primarily of $25.8 million for direct power costs, with the balance primarily incurred for compensation and rent costs.\nCost of revenues for Engineering for the period from the acquisition of ESS Metron on December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 was $3.6 million and there were no Engineering costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 2021 costs consisted primarily of $3.6 million for direct materials and labor, as well as indirect manufacturing costs.\nAcquisition-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $21.2 million and consisted of expenses incurred in connection with our acquisitions of Whinstone and ESS Metron. There were no acquisition-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>36\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $87.4 million and $10.3 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of stock-based compensation, legal and professional fees and other personnel and related costs. The increase of $77.2 million is primarily due to an increase in stock-compensation expense of $65.1 million resulting from additional awards (including the performance-based plan announced in August 2021), compensation expense, which increased by $5.7 million due to additional employees to support the Company's growth, and an increase in consulting fees of $2.6 million resulting primarily from assistance on internal control systems and procedures.\nDepreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $26.3 million, which is an increase of approximately $21.8 million, as compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher depreciation expense recognized for the Whinstone Facility and our recently acquired miners.\nChange in fair value of our derivative asset for the period from the acquisition of Whinstone to December 31, 2021, was $18.6 million, including $12.1 million recorded to adjust the fair value of our Power Supply Agreement, which was classified as a derivative asset and measured at fair value on the date of our acquisition of Whinstone, and $6.5 million from power sales to ERCOT through its demand response programs. There were no derivative assets for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment of long-term investments of $9.4 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recorded in connection with the impairment of our investment in Coinsquare Ltd., a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange ( Coinsquare\u201d).\nImpairment of cryptocurrencies for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $36.5 million and $1.0 million respectively, arising from the decline in Bitcoin prices during the periods.\nOther Income:\nOther income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $14.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The increase of $13.2 million is primarily related to a $26.3 million realized gain on the sale/exchange of long-term investment recognized in connection with the exchange of our shares of Coinsquare, partially offset by a $13.7 million unrealized loss on the decline in fair value our marketable equity securities.\nIncome Taxes:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company recorded an income tax expense of $0.3 million. There was no income tax expense or benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to consolidated U.S. GAAP financial measures, we consistently evaluate our use and calculation of the non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure defined as our EBITDA, adjusted to eliminate the effects of certain non-cash and / or non-recurring items, that do not reflect our ongoing strategic business operations. EBITDA is computed as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted, for certain income and expenses, management believes results in a performance measurement that represents a key indicator of the Company's core business operations of Bitcoin mining. The adjustments include fair value adjustments such as derivative power contract adjustments, equity securities value changes, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, in addition to financing and legacy business income and expense items. In 2021, we included impairments of cryptocurrencies and gain or losses on sales of cryptocurrencies as part of our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Based upon recent SEC comments to another issuer, we have determined to exclude impairments of cryptocurrencies and gain or losses on sales of cryptocurrencies from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to evaluate the positions of FASB and SEC on the accounting treatment of cryptocurrencies.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period-to-period by making such adjustments.\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to net income, the comparable measure under U.S. GAAP. Further, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to revenue growth, net income, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nTable 94:

approximately $12.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Other revenue consisted of license payments of approximately $0.1 million in each period. Revenues from cryptocurrency mining are impacted significantly by volatility in Bitcoin prices, as well as increases in the Bitcoin blockchain's network hash rate resulting from the growth in the overall quantity and quality of miners working to solve blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain and the difficulty index associated with the secure hashing algorithm employed in solving the blocks.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td>38\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFrom early 2019 to the end of 2020 the Bitcoin blockchain's network hash rate increased by approximately 249% as a result of, among other factors, the increased number of miners working to solve blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain during that period, many of which make use of newer, more efficient ASIC chips that are specially designed to solve blocks using the SHA-256 set of cryptographic hash functions employed on the Bitcoin blockchain. For years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average network hash rate working on the Bitcoin blockchain was 142.74 EH/s and 98.67 EH/s, respectively. Further, the difficulty index increased over 231% in the past two fiscal years. The cumulative difficulty index increase over each of years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 43.79% and 97.67%, respectively.\nCost and Expenses:\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $6.3 million consisted primarily of direct production costs of the mining operations, including rent and utilities and fees paid to Coinmint pursuant to the Coinmint Agreement, but excluding depreciation and amortization, which are separately stated. The cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $6.1 million. The cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as a percentage of mining revenue totaled 52.2% and 90.4%, respectively. The improvement in 2020 resulted from higher average Bitcoin values for mined Bitcoin and lower fixed and variable costs incurred for costs of revenue for the second half of 2020 following the relocation to the Coinmint Facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on the sale / exchange of cryptocurrencies of approximately $5.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019 the gain on sale of cryptocurrencies was $0.7 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $10.3 million, which is an approximately $1.1 million, or a 11.9% increase, as compared to $9.2 million in the 2019 period. Compensation related expense decreased by approximately $0.6 million due primarily to staff reductions during 2019, net of severance costs and the compensation expense of $0.3 for Tess Pay, Inc. ( Tess\u201d) in the 2019 period, which in 2020 is no longer reported in our consolidated financial statements. Stock-based compensation increased by approximately $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the 2019 period due to the 2020 issuance of 1,544,359 restricted stock units and the accelerated vesting of 471,544 restricted stock units due to the resignation of a member of the Company's board. Legal fees decreased by approximately $0.6 million due to legal matters associated primarily with the fees for the class action and derivative suits and special SEC related matters being higher in the 2019 period. Audit fees decreased approximately $0.3 million due to the higher level of financial activities and the audit of internal controls over financial reporting incurred for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDepreciation and Amortization:\nDepreciation and amortization expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $4.5 million, which is an increase of approximately $4.4 million, compared to $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher average depreciable equipment levels in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting from the Company's acquisition of 7,043 new miners, which the Company depreciates over their two-year estimated usable lives using the straight-line method.\nAsset Impairment Charges:\nImpairment of long-term investments of $9.4 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recorded in connection with the impairment of our investment in Coinsquare. The Company recorded this 100% impairment as a result of the OSC Order and Settlement Agreement in which Coinsquare and certain of its executives and directors admitted to violations of Ontario securities laws and conduct contrary to the public interest in connection with their operation of the Coinsquare Market.\nImpairment charges for cryptocurrencies was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was recorded to recognize an impairment of our cryptocurrencies during the three months ended March 31, 2020.\nAsset impairment charges of $1.5 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 and were related to $0.8 million for the impairment of our cryptocurrencies accounted for as intangible assets and $0.7 million related to our intangible assets acquired in connection with our former RiotX / Logical Brokerage business.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>39\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Income and Expense:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized income of approximately $1.4 million in connection with the reversal of our registration rights penalty.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized losses related to the issuance of convertible notes of approximately $6.2 million and expenses totaling $6.8 million to revalue the notes and the related warrant liability to fair value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a gain of approximately $1.1 million on the deconsolidation of Tess, due to our reduced ownership interest from 50.2% to 8.8%. No such expense was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income and interest expense was nominal.\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was nominal. Other income was approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a $0.4 million gain on forgiveness of our payable and interest in connection with our former agreement with BMSS, and a $0.5 million gain on forgiveness of various accounts payable balances.\nIncome Taxes:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded income tax benefits of zero and $0.1 million, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt December 31, 2021, we had working capital of approximately $463.7 million, which included cash and cash equivalents of $312.3 million. We reported a net loss of $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Net loss included $108.9 million in non-cash items consisting primarily of a realized gain on the sale/exchange of long-term investment of $26.3 million and the change in fair value of our derivative asset of $12.1 million, offset by stock-based compensation expense of $68.5 million, the impairment of cryptocurrencies of $36.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $26.3 million, an unrealized loss on marketable securities of $13.7 million, the issuance of common stock warrants of $1.2 million and income tax expense of $0.3 million.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td>40\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Commitments\nAt December 31, 2021, we had the following contractual commitments (in thousands):\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>Agreement Date * </td> <td> </td> <td>Original Purchase Commitment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Open Purchase Commitment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Deposit Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Shipping </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>April 5, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138,506 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>First Quarter 2022 - Fourth Quarter 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>October 29, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Second Quarter 2022 - Third Quarter 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>November 22, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Third Quarter 2022 - Fourth Quarter 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 10, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Third Quarter 2022 - Fourth Quarter 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 24, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Third Quarter 2022 - Fourth Quarter 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>527,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>301,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Pursuant to the Company's agreements with Bitmain, the Company is responsible for all shipping charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the miners.\nCoinmint Co-location Mining Services Agreement\nOn April 8, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Coinmint (the Coinmint Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Coinmint agreed to provide up to approximately 9.5 MW of electrical power and to perform all maintenance necessary to operate Riot's miners deployed at the Coinmint Facility. In exchange, Coinmint is reimbursed for direct production expenses and receives a performance fee based on the net cryptocurrencies generated by Riot's miners deployed at the Coinmint Facility. The amount of electrical power supplied to Riot's miners at the Coinmint Facility has subsequently been increased to accommodate Riot's expanding miner fleet. However, no formal written amendment to the Coinmint Agreement solidifying Riot's continuing access to sufficient power to operate its expanding fleet of miners has been entered into with Coinmint. The initial term of the Coinmint Agreement was six months, with automatic renewals for subsequent three month terms until terminated as provided in the agreement.\nMiners\nDuring 2021, we entered into six purchase agreements with Bitmain to acquire 52,500 Antminer model S19j (90 Terahash per second) ( TH/s\u201d) miners and 30,000 of their latest Antminer model S19XP (140 TH/s) miners for a combined total purchase price of approximately $535.0 million. Pursuant to these agreements, approximately $301.3 million remains payable to Bitmain in installments in advance of shipment of the miners, which is scheduled to occur on a monthly basis through December 2022. Of the remaining miners to be delivered, 48,495 new S19j-Pro model miners and 30,000 new S19XP model miners are all scheduled to be delivered throughout the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company entered into purchase agreements with Bitmain for the acquisition of a total of 33,646 of their model S19, S19-Pro, and S19j-Pro Antminer series of miners, to be shipped and delivered during 2020 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received 3,043 model S19 Antminers of these 33,646 new miners, all of which were deployed at the Coinmint Facility. The remaining 30,603 of these new miners were delivered in monthly shipments through January 2022.\nDuring December 2019, the Company purchased 4,000 Bitmain model S17-Pro Antminers for a total purchase price of approximately $6.3 million directly from Bitmain. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company relocated all 4,000 of these miners from its former Oklahoma facility to the Coinmint Facility in Massena, New York.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td>41\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue from Operations\nFunding our operations on a go-forward basis will rely significantly on our ability to mine Bitcoin at a price above our Mining costs and revenue generated from our Hosting and Engineering customers. We expect to generate ongoing revenues from Bitcoin rewards from our Mining operations and our ability to liquidate Bitcoin rewards at future values will be evaluated from time-to-time to generate cash for operations.\nGenerating Bitcoin rewards, for example, which exceed our production and overhead costs will determine our ability to report profit margins related to such mining operations, although accounting for our reported profitability is significantly complex. Furthermore, regardless of our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our Bitcoin from our Mining business, we may need to raise additional capital in the form of equity or debt to fund our operations and pursue our business strategy.\nThe ability to raise funds through the sale of equity, debt financings, or the sale of Bitcoin to maintain our operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and, even if we were successful, future equity issuances or convertible debt offerings could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and any future debt or debt securities may contain covenants that limit our operations or ability to enter into certain transactions. Our ability to realize revenue through Bitcoin production and successfully convert Bitcoin into cash or fund overhead with Bitcoin is subject to a number of risks, including regulatory, financial and business risks, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, we have observed significant historical volatility in the market price of Bitcoin and, as such, future prices cannot be predicted. See the discussion of risks affecting our business under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from our Mining operations, Hosting operations or Engineering operations when needed or secure additional sources of funding, it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending or explore other strategic alternatives.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offerings\nATM Offering\nIn August 2021, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., B. Riley FBR, Inc., BTIG, LLC, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the Sales Agents\u201d) dated August 31, 2021 (the Sales Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which we sold $600 million in shares of our common stock through the Sales Agents, acting as our sales agent and/or principal, in a continuous at-the-market offering (the 2021 ATM Offering\u201d).

Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, stock-based compensation and business combinations.\nThe Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies the Company has adopted. In order to get a full understanding of the Company's financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed. A summary of the Company's critical accounting policies follows:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td>44\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company accounts for financial instruments under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820\u201d). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:\nLevel 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 - observable inputs other than Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and\nLevel 3 - assets and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable.\nObservable inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company's market assumptions. Unobservable inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. In some cases, the inputs used to measure an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is required to be classified using the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Such determination requires significant management judgment. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had derivative assets and contingent consideration liability measured at fair value. As of December 31, 2020, there were no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The carrying amounts of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nCryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrencies (primarily Bitcoin) are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The classification of cryptocurrencies as a current asset has been made after the Company's consideration of the significant consistent daily trading volume on readily available cryptocurrency exchanges, there are no limitations or restrictions on Company's ability to sell Bitcoin and the pattern of actual sales of Bitcoin by the Company. Cryptocurrencies purchased are recorded at cost and cryptocurrencies awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company's revenue recognition policy disclosed below.\nCryptocurrencies held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the cryptocurrency at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.\nPurchases of cryptocurrencies by the Company are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, while cryptocurrencies awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The sales of cryptocurrencies are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and any realized gains or losses from such sales are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first in first out (FIFO) method of accounting.\nInvestment in marketable equity securities\nOur investment in marketable equity securities consists entirely of common shares of Mogo, Inc. (NASDAQ: MOGO), resulting from the April and May 2021 transactions. (See Note 7, Investments in Marketable Equity Securities\u201d). The Company accounted for this investment in accordance with ASC 321, Investments-Equity Securities, ( ASC 321\u201d) due to the shares having a readily determinable fair value since they are traded on NASDAQ and have significant average daily volume traded. As a result, the investment is required to be measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in other income (expense).\nTable 112: <table><tr><td>45\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.\nLeases\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d). Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right of use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right of use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right of use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company leases its primary office locations, which expire between 2.5 and seven years, manufacturing facilities of ESS Metron, which expire between 3.5 and 10 years and a ground lease at the Whinstone Facility that expires in December 2030, all of which are inclusive of extension options the Company is reasonably certain will be exercised. At December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any significant operating lease balances.\nIn November 2021, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord of certain Whinstone abandoned leases for approximately $0.9 million. After eliminating the associated operating lease liabilities, we recognized other income of approximately $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Company also terminated two former operating leases during the year ended December 31, 2020: (i) the lease of the Oklahoma facility and (ii) the Florida lease, both of which are discussed under Prior Leases\u201d above.\nIn calculating the right of use asset and lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components as permitted under ASC 842. The Company excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less from the new guidance as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nRevenue Recognition\nMining\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\n\u00b7 Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer;\n\u00b7 Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u00b7 Step 3: Determine the transaction price;\n\u00b7 Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u00b7 Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nIn order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606's definition of a distinct\u201d good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct), and the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\nTable 114: <table><tr><td>46\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Variable consideration </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Constraining estimates of variable consideration </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>The existence of a significant financing component in the contract </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Noncash consideration </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Consideration payable to a customer </td> </tr>\n</table>\nVariable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate.\nThe Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts, as amended from time to time, with the mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and the Company's enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are immaterial and are recorded as a deduction from revenue), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain. The terms of the agreement provide that neither party can dispute settlement terms after thirty-five days following settlement. The Company's fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.\nProviding computing power to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the Bitcoin blockchain (in a process known as solving a block\u201d) is an output of the Company's ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in the Company's contracts with mining pool operators. The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time the Company has earned the award from the pools. The consideration is all variable. Because it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur, the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and the Company receives confirmation of the consideration it will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.\nFair value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the market rate of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td>47\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nHosting\nIn general, we provide power for our data center customers on a variable (sub-metered) basis. A customer pays us variable monthly fees for the specific amount of power utilized at rates specified in each contract, subject to certain minimums. We recognize variable power revenue each month as the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved, power is provided to our customers, and our customers utilize the power (the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company's performance).\nWe have determined that our contracts contain a series of performance obligations which qualify to be recognized under a practical expedient available known as the right to invoice.\u201d This determination allows variable consideration in such contracts to be allocated to and recognized in the period to which the consideration relates, which is typically the period in which it is billed, rather than requiring estimation of variable consideration at the inception of the contract. We have also determined that the contracts contain a significant financing component because the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing by a period, exceeding one year.\nThe Company also installs certain hosted customers' mining equipment and bills the customer at a fixed fee per piece of equipment or at an hourly rate. Revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.\nWe generate engineering and construction services revenue from the fabrication and deployment of immersion cooling technology for Bitcoin mining customers. We bill the customer at a fixed monthly fee or at an hourly rate. For the construction of customer-owned equipment, revenue is recognized upon completion of each phase of the construction project, as defined in each contract. For construction of assets owned by Whinstone but paid for and used by the customer during the term of their hosting contract, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the contract.\nMaintenance services include cleaning, cabling and other services to maintain the customers' equipment. We bill the customer at a fixed monthly fee or at an hourly rate. Revenue is recognized as these services are provided.\nDeferred revenue is primarily from advance payments received and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the contract or upon completion of the installation of the customers' equipment.\nOur primary hosting contracts contain Service Level Agreement clauses, which guarantee a certain percentage of time the power will be available to our customer. In the rare case that we may incur penalties under these clauses, we account for payments made to customers in accordance with ASC 606-10-32-25, Consideration Payable to a Customer, which requires the payment be recognized as variable consideration and a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore, of revenue, when not in exchange for a good or service from the customer.\nEngineering\nSubstantially all revenue is derived from the sale of custom products built to customers' specifications under fixed-price contracts with one identified performance obligation. Revenues are recognized over time as performance creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and for which the Company has an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract.\nTo determine the amount of revenue to recognize over time, the Company utilizes the cost-to-cost method as management believes cost incurred best represents the amount of work completed and remaining on projects. As the cost-to-cost method is driven by incurred cost, the Company calculates the percentage of completion by dividing costs incurred to date by the total estimated cost. The percentage of completion is then multiplied by estimated revenues to determine inception-to-date revenue. Approved changes to design plans are generally recognized as an adjustment to the percentage of completion calculation on a catch-up basis. Revenue recognized for the period is the current inception-to-date recognized revenue less the prior period inception-to-date recognized revenue. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined, and the amount of the loss is updated in subsequent reporting periods. Additionally, contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td>48\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management's assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts, and therefore, profit and revenue recognition. Any costs to obtain a contract are not material to the Company's financial statements and would be expensed as incurred. Because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change within the near term. The length of time for the Company to complete a custom product varies but is typically between four to 12 weeks.\nCustomers are typically required to make periodic progress payments to the Company based on contractually agreed-upon milestones. Invoices are due net, 30 days, and retainage, if any, is generally due 30 days after delivery. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue is revenue recognized from an upfront license fee generated from our legacy animal health business. The upfront fee was recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized into revenue over the term of the License Agreement.\nDerivative Accounting\nPower Supply Contract and Demand Response Services\nIn May 2020, Whinstone entered into a Power Supply Agreement with TXU Energy Retail Company LLC ( TXU\u201d) to provide the delivery of a fixed amount of electricity by TXU to Whinstone (via the facility owned by Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC ( Oncor\u201d)) for a fixed price through April 30, 2030. The Power Supply Agreement provides a consistent and sufficient supply of electricity at the Whinstone Facility. If Whinstone uses more electricity than contracted, the cost of the excess is incurred at the current spot rate. Concurrently, Whinstone entered into a contract with Oncor for the extension of delivery system transmission/substation facilities to facilitate delivery of the electricity to the Whinstone Facility (the Facilities Agreement\u201d). Power costs incurred under this contract are determined on an hourly basis using settlement information provided by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT\u201d) and are recorded in cost of revenues - data center hosting in our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe demand response services program ( Demand Response Service\u201d) provides the ERCOT market with valuable reliability and economic services by helping to preserve system reliability, enhancing competition, mitigating price spikes, and encouraging the demand side of the market to respond better to wholesale price signals. In collaboration with market participants such as the Company, ERCOT has developed demand response products and services for customers that have the ability to reduce or modify electricity use in response to instructions or signals. Market participants with electrical loads like Whinstone may participate in the Demand Response Service program directly by offering their electrical loads into the ERCOT markets, or indirectly by voluntarily reducing their energy usage in response to increasing wholesale prices.\nWhile we manage operating costs at the Whinstone Facility in part by periodically selling unused or uneconomical power in the market back to ERCOT, we do not consider such actions trading activities. That is, we do not engage in speculation in the power market as part of our ordinary activities. Because the Demand Response Services programs allow for net settlement, we have determined the Power Supply Agreement meets the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, ( ASC 815\u201d). However, because we have the ability to sell the power back to the grid rather than take physical delivery, physical delivery is not probable through the entirety of the contract and therefore, we do not believe the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception applies to the Power Supply Agreement. Accordingly, the Power Supply Agreement (the non-hedging derivative contract) is recorded at estimated fair value each reporting period with the change in the fair value recorded in change in fair value of derivative asset in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn February 2021, the State of Texas experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event that resulted in prolonged freezing temperatures and caused an electricity generation shortage that was severely disruptive to the whole state. While demand for electricity reached extraordinary levels due to the extreme cold, the supply of electricity significantly decreased in part because of the inability of certain power generation facilities to supply electric power to the grid. Due to the extreme market price of electricity during this time, at the request of ERCOT, Whinstone stopped supplying power to its customers and instead sold power back to the grid.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td>49\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn April 2021, under the provisions of the TXU Power Supply Agreement, and as a result of the weather event, Whinstone entered into a Qualified Scheduling Entity ( QSE\u201d) Letter Agreement, which resulted in Whinstone being entitled to receive approximately $125.1 million for its power sales during the February winter storm, all under the terms and conditions of the QSE Letter Agreement. Whinstone received cash of $29.0 million in April 2021 (after deducting $10.0 million in power management fees owed by Whinstone), approximately $59.7 million is scheduled to be credited against future power bills of Whinstone beginning in 2022 and the remaining $26.3 million is contingent upon ERCOT's future remittance. These amounts are gross before fair value adjustments and expenses incurred by Whinstone for power management fees noted above and customer settlements. The fair value of the settlement agreement was estimated and recognized as an asset as part of acquisition accounting. Additionally, pursuant to the Northern Data stock purchase agreement, the Company agreed to pay Seller additional consideration in cash in the amount of the future power credits, net of income taxes, when and if realized by Whinstone. See Note 4, Acquisitions\u201d.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, ( ASC 805\u201d) in the accounting for acquisitions of businesses. ASC 805 requires us to use the acquisition method of accounting by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business, measured at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the aforementioned amounts. Contingent consideration is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value as of each reporting date until the contingency is resolved, and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Contingent consideration is recorded in long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately apply preliminary values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include; future expected cash flows from customer contracts, discount rates, and estimated market changes in the value of the Power Supply Agreement, which is accounted for as a nonhedged derivative contract. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company determined that it has three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes, Bitcoin Mining, Data Center Hosting, and Electrical Products and Engineering, which is consistent with internal management reporting and management's oversight of operations. Goodwill is not amortized and is reviewed for impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We use both qualitative and quantitative analyses in making this determination. Our analyses require significant assumptions and judgments, including assumptions about future economic conditions, revenue growth, and operating margins, among other factors. Example events or changes in circumstances considered in the qualitative analysis, many of which are subjective in nature, include: a significant negative trend in our industry or overall economic trends, a significant change in how we use the acquired assets, a significant change in or our business strategy, a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, a significant change in regulations or in the industry that could affect the value of the asset, and a change in segments. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs the quantitative test to identify and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered impaired and that excess is recognized as a goodwill impairment loss.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td>50\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIntangible assets with finite lives are comprised of customer contracts that are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which is their contractual term. The Company performs assessments to determine whether finite-lived classification is still appropriate at least annually. The carrying value of finite-lived assets and their remaining useful lives are also reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist which may indicate a potential impairment or revision to the amortization period. A finite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired if its carrying value exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from it. We exercise judgment in selecting the assumptions used in the estimated future undiscounted cash flows analysis. Impairment is measured by the amount that the carrying value exceeds fair value.\nSegment and Reporting Unit Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. A committee consisting of the Company's executives is determined to be the CODM. The Company has three operating segments as of December 31, 2021. See Note 18, Segment Information\u201d.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based payment awards exchanged for services at the estimated grant date fair value of the award. Stock options issued under the Company's equity incentive plans are granted with an exercise price equal to no less than the market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant and expire up to ten years from the date of grant. These options generally vest on the grant date or over a one- year period.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management's best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment.\nExpected Term - The expected term of options represents the period that the Company's stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified method, which is the half-life from vesting to the end of its contractual term.\nExpected Volatility - The Company computes stock price volatility over expected terms based on its historical common stock trading prices.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td>51\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRisk-Free Interest Rate - The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U. S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.\nExpected Dividend - The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common shares and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in its valuation models.\nThe Company elected to account for forfeited awards as they occur, as permitted by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-09. Ultimately, the actual expenses recognized over the vesting period will be for those shares that vested.\nEarnings (loss) per share\nBasic net earnings (loss) per share ( EPS\u201d) of common stock is computed by dividing the Company's net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. The Company excludes the unvested restricted share units (RSUs) awarded to its employees, officers, directors, and contractors under the 2019 Equity Plan from this net loss per share calculation because including them would be antidilutive.\nRecently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements\nThe Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company's financial reporting, the Company undertakes a review to determine the consequences of the change to its financial statements and believes that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company's financial statements properly reflect the change.\nWe have considered recently issued accounting pronouncements and do not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSee Note 3 to our financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_truncated": "The following table presents additional information about our Mining activities, including cryptocurrency production and sales of the cryptocurrency the Company mined during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 ($ in thousands):\nIn general, we provide power for our data center customers on a variable (sub-metered) basis.

Hosting revenue includes upfront payments, which we record as deferred revenue and generally recognize as services are provided. We provide energized space and operating and maintenance services to third-party mining companies who locate their mining hardware at our Whinstone Facility under long-term contracts. We account for these agreements as a single performance obligation for services being delivered in a series with delivery being measured by daily successful operation of the mining hardware. As such, we recognize revenue over the life of the contract as its series of performance obligations are met. The contracts are recognized in the amount for which we have the right to invoice because we elected the right to invoice\u201d practical expedient.\nFor a more detailed discussion of our At-the-Market Equity Offerings, see Note 12, Stockholders' Equity\u201d, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of miners </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Miners deployed at January 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,043 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Miners received and deployed during the year ended December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,864 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Miners received during the year ended December 31, 2021, but not yet deployed </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,744 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Miners under contract, but not yet received </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total miners under contract, expected to be received, or deployed at December 31, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,146 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther revenue is revenue recognized from an upfront license fee generated from our legacy animal health business.

ASC 805 requires us to use the acquisition method of accounting by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business, measured at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the aforementioned amounts. Contingent consideration is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value as of each reporting date until the contingency is resolved, and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Contingent consideration is recorded in long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFrom early 2019 to the end of 2020 the Bitcoin blockchain's network hash rate increased by approximately 249% as a result of, among other factors, the increased number of miners working to solve blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain during that period, many of which make use of newer, more efficient ASIC chips that are specially designed to solve blocks using the SHA-256 set of cryptographic hash functions employed on the Bitcoin blockchain. For years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average network hash rate working on the Bitcoin blockchain was 142.74 EH/s and 98.67 EH/s, respectively. Further, the difficulty index increased over 231% in the past two fiscal years. The cumulative difficulty index increase over each of years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 43.79% and 97.67%, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $10.3 million, which is an approximately $1.1 million, or a 11.9% increase, as compared to $9.2 million in the 2019 period. Compensation related expense decreased by approximately $0.6 million due primarily to staff reductions during 2019, net of severance costs and the compensation expense of $0.3 for Tess Pay, Inc. ( Tess\u201d) in the 2019 period, which in 2020 is no longer reported in our consolidated financial statements. Stock-based compensation increased by approximately $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the 2019 period due to the 2020 issuance of 1,544,359 restricted stock units and the accelerated vesting of 471,544 restricted stock units due to the resignation of a member of the Company's board. Legal fees decreased by approximately $0.6 million due to legal matters associated primarily with the fees for the class action and derivative suits and special SEC related matters being higher in the 2019 period. Audit fees decreased approximately $0.3 million due to the higher level of financial activities and the audit of internal controls over financial reporting incurred for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are comprised of customer contracts that are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which is their contractual term. The Company performs assessments to determine whether finite-lived classification is still appropriate at least annually. The carrying value of finite-lived assets and their remaining useful lives are also reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist which may indicate a potential impairment or revision to the amortization period. A finite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired if its carrying value exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from it. We exercise judgment in selecting the assumptions used in the estimated future undiscounted cash flows analysis. Impairment is measured by the amount that the carrying value exceeds fair value.\nStrategic Acquisitions\nMiner Purchases and Deployments\nCOVID-19\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from our Mining operations, Hosting operations or Engineering operations when needed or secure additional sources of funding, it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending or explore other strategic alternatives.\nThe Company elected to account for forfeited awards as they occur, as permitted by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-09. Ultimately, the actual expenses recognized over the vesting period will be for those shares that vested.\nCustomers are typically required to make periodic progress payments to the Company based on contractually agreed-upon milestones. Invoices are due net, 30 days, and retainage, if any, is generally due 30 days after delivery. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.\nPurchases of cryptocurrencies by the Company are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, while cryptocurrencies awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The sales of cryptocurrencies are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and any realized gains or losses from such sales are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first in first out (FIFO) method of accounting.\n \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2021, we had purchased, received and/or deployed the following miners:\nNet cash used in operating activities was $86.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash was consumed from operations by a net loss of $7.9 million, less non-cash items of $108.9 million, consisting primarily of a realized gain on the sale/exchange of long-term investment of $26.3 million and the change in fair value of our derivative asset of $12.1 million, partially offset by stock-based compensation expense of $68.5 million, the impairment of cryptocurrencies of $36.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $26.3 million, an unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of $13.7 million, the issuance of common stock warrants of $1.2 million, and income tax expense of $0.3 million, net of other immaterial items. The change in assets and liabilities of $187.3 million consisted primarily of increased cryptocurrencies of $184.4 million, increased accounts receivable of $4.4 million, increased security deposits of $3.2 million, decreased costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $3.3 million, increased prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.9 million, increased accounts payable and accrued expenses of $13.3 million, change in fair value of future power credits of $1.0 million, increased customer deposits of $6.1 million, decreased deferred revenue of $12.9 million, decreased lease liabilities of $1.7 million and decreased billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings of $0.6 million.\n 35 \nBusiness Combinations\nGenerating Bitcoin rewards, for example, which exceed our production and overhead costs will determine our ability to report profit margins related to such mining operations, although accounting for our reported profitability is significantly complex. Furthermore, regardless of our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our Bitcoin from our Mining business, we may need to raise additional capital in the form of equity or debt to fund our operations and pursue our business strategy.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we received net proceeds of approximately $257.5 million (after deducting $7.3 million in commissions and expenses) from sales of 49,932,051 shares of its common stock, no par value, at a weighted average gross sales price of $5.30 per share pursuant to an At-The-Market Sales Agreement, dated effective as of May 24, 2019, as amended (the 2019 ATM Sales Agreement\u201d), with its sales agent, H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC ( Wainwright\u201d).\n 46 \nImpairment charges for cryptocurrencies was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was recorded to recognize an impairment of our cryptocurrencies during the three months ended March 31, 2020.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:\nAfter closing the Whinstone Acquisition, we announced a large-scale expansion of the Whinstone Facility by 400 MW, which is anticipated to bring the Whinstone Facility to 700 MW in total capacity of Bitcoin mining infrastructure. The expansion of the Whinstone Facility will provide us with the necessary infrastructure to operate our miners efficiently, and deploy our future miners, as well as provide additional expansion opportunities in our Hosting business.\nPower Supply Contract and Demand Response Services\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $490.3 million, primarily consisting of deposits on equipment of $274.8 million, our acquisition of Whinstone of $40.9 million, net, our acquisition of ESS Metron of $29.6 million, net, and purchases of property and equipment of $147.1 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1.8 million received for our Coinsquare investment.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nDepreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $26.3 million, which is an increase of approximately $21.8 million, as compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher depreciation expense recognized for the Whinstone Facility and our recently acquired miners.\nIf a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company recorded an income tax expense of $0.3 million. There was no income tax expense or benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe ability to raise funds through the sale of equity, debt financings, or the sale of Bitcoin to maintain our operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and, even if we were successful, future equity issuances or convertible debt offerings could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and any future debt or debt securities may contain covenants that limit our operations or ability to enter into certain transactions. Our ability to realize revenue through Bitcoin production and successfully convert Bitcoin into cash or fund overhead with Bitcoin is subject to a number of risks, including regulatory, financial and business risks, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, we have observed significant historical volatility in the market price of Bitcoin and, as such, future prices cannot be predicted. See the discussion of risks affecting our business under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\nFair value of financial instruments\nOther Income:\n \nStock Based Compensation\nRevenue Recognition\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDeferred revenue is primarily from advance payments received and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the contract or upon completion of the installation of the customers' equipment.\nThe Company has been named a defendant in several class action and other investor related lawsuits as more fully described in Part I, Item 3., Legal Proceedings\u201d, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While the Company maintains policies of insurance, such policies may not cover all of the costs or expenses associated with responding to such matters or any liability or settlement associated with any lawsuits and are subject to significant deductible or retention amounts.\nContractual Commitments\nDuring 2021, we received 34,608 additional Antminer model S19-Pro miners pursuant to purchase orders with their manufacturer, Bitmain, and, as of December 31, 2021, we had deployed a total of 30,907 miners in our Mining operation. Additionally, we executed six additional purchase orders with Bitmain to acquire 43,500 Antminer model S19j (90 Terahash per second) ( TH/s\u201d)) miners, and 9,000 Antminer model S19j-Pro (100 TH/s) miners, and 30,000 of Bitmain's latest generation Antminer model S19XP (140 TH/s) miners, for a combined total purchase price of approximately $535.0 million. Pursuant to these agreements, approximately $301.3 million remains payable to Bitmain in installments in advance of shipment of the miners, which is scheduled to occur on a monthly basis through December 2022.\nFrom the May 26, 2021 acquisition date through December 31, 2021, Hosting revenue and net income was approximately $24.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Additionally, the majority of our $22.6 million of deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 is related to advance payments made by Whinstone customers, which will be primarily recognized over the remaining lives of the underlying contracts, or approximately eight years.\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $6.3 million consisted primarily of direct production costs of the mining operations, including rent and utilities and fees paid to Coinmint pursuant to the Coinmint Agreement, but excluding depreciation and amortization, which are separately stated. The cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $6.1 million. The cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as a percentage of mining revenue totaled 52.2% and 90.4%, respectively. The improvement in 2020 resulted from higher average Bitcoin values for mined Bitcoin and lower fixed and variable costs incurred for costs of revenue for the second half of 2020 following the relocation to the Coinmint Facility.\nBitcoin Mining\nIn April 2021, under the provisions of the TXU Power Supply Agreement, and as a result of the weather event, Whinstone entered into a Qualified Scheduling Entity ( QSE\u201d) Letter Agreement, which resulted in Whinstone being entitled to receive approximately $125.1 million for its power sales during the February winter storm, all under the terms and conditions of the QSE Letter Agreement. Whinstone received cash of $29.0 million in April 2021 (after deducting $10.0 million in power management fees owed by Whinstone), approximately $59.7 million is scheduled to be credited against future power bills of Whinstone beginning in 2022 and the remaining $26.3 million is contingent upon ERCOT's future remittance. These amounts are gross before fair value adjustments and expenses incurred by Whinstone for power management fees noted above and customer settlements. The fair value of the settlement agreement was estimated and recognized as an asset as part of acquisition accounting. Additionally, pursuant to the Northern Data stock purchase agreement, the Company agreed to pay Seller additional consideration in cash in the amount of the future power credits, net of income taxes, when and if realized by Whinstone. See Note 4, Acquisitions\u201d.\nThe Company accounts for share-based payment awards exchanged for services at the estimated grant date fair value of the award. Stock options issued under the Company's equity incentive plans are granted with an exercise price equal to no less than the market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant and expire up to ten years from the date of grant. These options generally vest on the grant date or over a one- year period.\nCost of revenues for Hosting for the period from the acquisition of Whinstone on May 26, 2021 to December 31, 2021 was $33.0 million and there were no Hosting costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 2021 costs consisted primarily of $25.8 million for direct power costs, with the balance primarily incurred for compensation and rent costs.\nWe anticipate that 2022 will be a year of consolidation in the Bitcoin mining industry, and we believe that, given our relative position in the competitive landscape, we are likely positioned to benefit from this consolidation. As a result of any strategic action undertaken by us, our business and financial results may change significantly. We are continuously evaluating strategic opportunities we may decide to undertake as part of our strategic growth initiatives; however, we can offer no assurances that any strategic opportunities we decide to undertake will be achieved on the schedule or within the budget we anticipate, if at all, in our competitive and evolving industry. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for additional discussion regarding potential impacts our competitive and evolving industry may have on our business.\nObservable inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company's market assumptions. Unobservable inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. In some cases, the inputs used to measure an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is required to be classified using the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Such determination requires significant management judgment. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had derivative assets and contingent consideration liability measured at fair value. As of December 31, 2020, there were no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The carrying amounts of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nEarnings (loss) per share\nThe Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts, as amended from time to time, with the mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and the Company's enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are immaterial and are recorded as a deduction from revenue), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain. The terms of the agreement provide that neither party can dispute settlement terms after thirty-five days following settlement. The Company's fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.\nRevenues:\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIn addition to consolidated U.S. GAAP financial measures, we consistently evaluate our use and calculation of the non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure defined as our EBITDA, adjusted to eliminate the effects of certain non-cash and / or non-recurring items, that do not reflect our ongoing strategic business operations. EBITDA is computed as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted, for certain income and expenses, management believes results in a performance measurement that represents a key indicator of the Company's core business operations of Bitcoin mining. The adjustments include fair value adjustments such as derivative power contract adjustments, equity securities value changes, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, in addition to financing and legacy business income and expense items. In 2021, we included impairments of cryptocurrencies and gain or losses on sales of cryptocurrencies as part of our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Based upon recent SEC comments to another issuer, we have determined to exclude impairments of cryptocurrencies and gain or losses on sales of cryptocurrencies from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to evaluate the positions of FASB and SEC on the accounting treatment of cryptocurrencies.\n \nOn May 26, 2021, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Whinstone US, Inc. ( Whinstone\u201d) pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, dated as of April 8, 2021, we entered into with Northern Data AG ( Northern Data\u201d) and Whinstone (the Whinstone Acquisition\u201d). At the closing of the Whinstone Acquisition, we paid to Northern Data $80 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the stock purchase agreement, and issued to Northern Data 11.8 million shares of our common stock. We also entered into a shareholder agreement with Northern Data on the closing date granting Northern Data certain registration rights whereby we registered the 11.8 million shares issued to Northern Data as part of the Whinstone Acquisition. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, there were no registration rights obligations to Northern Data.\nProviding computing power to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the Bitcoin blockchain (in a process known as solving a block\u201d) is an output of the Company's ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in the Company's contracts with mining pool operators. The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time the Company has earned the award from the pools. The consideration is all variable. Because it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur, the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and the Company receives confirmation of the consideration it will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $4.5 million, which is an increase of approximately $4.4 million, compared to $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher average depreciable equipment levels in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting from the Company's acquisition of 7,043 new miners, which the Company depreciates over their two-year estimated usable lives using the straight-line method.\nThe Company also terminated two former operating leases during the year ended December 31, 2020: (i) the lease of the Oklahoma facility and (ii) the Florida lease, both of which are discussed under Prior Leases\u201d above.\nWhinstone\nCryptocurrencies held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the cryptocurrency at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.\nOther Revenue\nNet cash used in operating activities was $15.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash was consumed from the net loss of $20.3 million, less non-cash items of $14.7 million, including a loss on the issuance of our convertible notes, common stock and warrants of $6.2 million, the change in fair value of our convertible notes and the related warrant liability of $6.8 million, amortization of our right of use assets of $2.3 million, stock-based compensation totaling $0.7 million, impairment to our cryptocurrencies of $0.8 million, an impairment of intangible assets acquired of $0.7 million related to our decision not to pursue our Logical Brokerage business, net of deferred income tax benefit of $0.1 million, and depreciation and amortization totaling $0.1 million, offset by a $1.1 million gain recognized on the deconsolidation of Tess, a $0.9 million gain on the extinguishment of notes, interest and accounts payable, other income of approximately $0.1 million, primarily related to the amortization of our deferred revenue related to our legacy animal health business and a $0.7 million related to the gain from the sale of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies increased by $6.6 million, offset by, a decrease in our lease liability of $2.3 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.8 million.\n 45 \n \n 40 \n \nResults of Operations Comparative Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n 39 \nSummary of Mining Results\nAccounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include; future expected cash flows from customer contracts, discount rates, and estimated market changes in the value of the Power Supply Agreement, which is accounted for as a nonhedged derivative contract. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded income tax benefits of zero and $0.1 million, respectively.\nMiners\nGlobal Logistics\n 36 \nMining\nWe have determined that our contracts contain a series of performance obligations which qualify to be recognized under a practical expedient available known as the right to invoice.\u201d This determination allows variable consideration in such contracts to be allocated to and recognized in the period to which the consideration relates, which is typically the period in which it is billed, rather than requiring estimation of variable consideration at the inception of the contract. We have also determined that the contracts contain a significant financing component because the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing by a period, exceeding one year.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had working capital of approximately $463.7 million, which included cash and cash equivalents of $312.3 million. We reported a net loss of $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Net loss included $108.9 million in non-cash items consisting primarily of a realized gain on the sale/exchange of long-term investment of $26.3 million and the change in fair value of our derivative asset of $12.1 million, offset by stock-based compensation expense of $68.5 million, the impairment of cryptocurrencies of $36.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $26.3 million, an unrealized loss on marketable securities of $13.7 million, the issuance of common stock warrants of $1.2 million and income tax expense of $0.3 million.\nCoinmint Co-location Mining Services Agreement\nMaintenance services include cleaning, cabling and other services to maintain the customers' equipment. We bill the customer at a fixed monthly fee or at an hourly rate. Revenue is recognized as these services are provided.\n\nAsset impairment charges of $1.5 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 and were related to $0.8 million for the impairment of our cryptocurrencies accounted for as intangible assets and $0.7 million related to our intangible assets acquired in connection with our former RiotX / Logical Brokerage business.\nRevenue from Operations\nIn order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606's definition of a distinct\u201d good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct), and the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\n \nWhile we manage operating costs at the Whinstone Facility in part by periodically selling unused or uneconomical power in the market back to ERCOT, we do not consider such actions trading activities. That is, we do not engage in speculation in the power market as part of our ordinary activities. Because the Demand Response Services programs allow for net settlement, we have determined the Power Supply Agreement meets the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, ( ASC 815\u201d). However, because we have the ability to sell the power back to the grid rather than take physical delivery, physical delivery is not probable through the entirety of the contract and therefore, we do not believe the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception applies to the Power Supply Agreement. Accordingly, the Power Supply Agreement (the non-hedging derivative contract) is recorded at estimated fair value each reporting period with the change in the fair value recorded in change in fair value of derivative asset in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCost and Expenses:\nIn February 2021, the State of Texas experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event that resulted in prolonged freezing temperatures and caused an electricity generation shortage that was severely disruptive to the whole state. While demand for electricity reached extraordinary levels due to the extreme cold, the supply of electricity significantly decreased in part because of the inability of certain power generation facilities to supply electric power to the grid. Due to the extreme market price of electricity during this time, at the request of ERCOT, Whinstone stopped supplying power to its customers and instead sold power back to the grid.\nWe generate engineering and construction services revenue from the fabrication and deployment of immersion cooling technology for Bitcoin mining customers. We bill the customer at a fixed monthly fee or at an hourly rate. For the construction of customer-owned equipment, revenue is recognized upon completion of each phase of the construction project, as defined in each contract. For construction of assets owned by Whinstone but paid for and used by the customer during the term of their hosting contract, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the contract.\nOther income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $14.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The increase of $13.2 million is primarily related to a $26.3 million realized gain on the sale/exchange of long-term investment recognized in connection with the exchange of our shares of Coinsquare, partially offset by a $13.7 million unrealized loss on the decline in fair value our marketable equity securities.\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was nominal. Other income was approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a $0.4 million gain on forgiveness of our payable and interest in connection with our former agreement with BMSS, and a $0.5 million gain on forgiveness of various accounts payable balances.\nDepreciation and Amortization:\nWe operate in an environment which is consistently evolving based on the proliferation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. A significant component of our strategy is to effectively and efficiently allocate capital between opportunities that generate the highest return on capital.\nLevel 2 - observable inputs other than Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and\nReconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial metric for historical periods are presented in the table below:\n \nIncome Taxes:\nDerivative Accounting\nBusiness Overview:\n \nWe are a vertically integrated Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency infrastructure development company principally engaged in enhancing our capabilities to mine Bitcoin. We also provide the critical mining infrastructure for our institutional scale clients to mine Bitcoin at our Bitcoin mining facility (the Whinstone Facility\u201d). Our Whinstone Facility is believed to be the largest Bitcoin mining facility, as measured by developed capacity, in North America.\nDuring January 2021, in connection with the Second Amendment to the At-the-Market Sales Agreement, as amended, with our sales agent under such agreement, H.C. Wainwright, we received gross proceeds of approximately $84.8 million ($82.7 million net, after $2.1 million in expenses) from the sale of 4,433,468 shares of common stock, with an average fair value of $19.13 per share pursuant to the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-251149) filed with the SEC on December 4, 2020 (the December 2020 ATM Offering\u201d). With the sale and issuance of these shares and of the shares previously sold and issued during the year ended December 31, 2020, all $200 million in shares of our common stock registered under the December 2020 Registration Statement had been issued and we completed the December 2020 ATM Offering. Under the terms of the December 2020 ATM Offering, only shares of our common stock were issued.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately apply preliminary values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had the following contractual commitments (in thousands):\n\u00b7 Step 3: Determine the transaction price;\n\u00b7 Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate - The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U. S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.\n \nTo determine the amount of revenue to recognize over time, the Company utilizes the cost-to-cost method as management believes cost incurred best represents the amount of work completed and remaining on projects. As the cost-to-cost method is driven by incurred cost, the Company calculates the percentage of completion by dividing costs incurred to date by the total estimated cost. The percentage of completion is then multiplied by estimated revenues to determine inception-to-date revenue. Approved changes to design plans are generally recognized as an adjustment to the percentage of completion calculation on a catch-up basis. Revenue recognized for the period is the current inception-to-date recognized revenue less the prior period inception-to-date recognized revenue. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined, and the amount of the loss is updated in subsequent reporting periods. Additionally, contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract.\n \nResults of Operations Comparative Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nRecently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements\nOther revenue consisting of license fees earned from our legacy animal bioscience business was not significant in either period.\nChange in fair value of our derivative asset for the period from the acquisition of Whinstone to December 31, 2021, was $18.6 million, including $12.1 million recorded to adjust the fair value of our Power Supply Agreement, which was classified as a derivative asset and measured at fair value on the date of our acquisition of Whinstone, and $6.5 million from power sales to ERCOT through its demand response programs. There were no derivative assets for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity interests (the ESS Metron Acquisition\u201d) of Ferrie Franzmann Industries, LLC (d/b/a ESS Metron) ( ESS Metron\u201d). At the closing of the ESS Metron Acquisition, we issued to the sellers $25 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the membership interest purchase agreement, and 715,413 shares of our common stock, subject to a holdback of 70,165 shares as security for the sellers' indemnification obligations under the membership interest purchase agreement. We also granted the sellers certain registration rights relating to the resale by the sellers of the shares issued to them under the membership interest purchase agreement, among other things. Pursuant to these registration rights, we registered the resale of the 645,248 shares issued to the sellers at the closing of the ESS Metron Acquisition pursuant to the prospectus supplement we filed with the SEC on December 1, 2021 under our effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on August 31, 2021 (File No. 333-259212). These registration rights also apply to the 70,165 holdback shares withheld at closing of the ESS Metron Acquisition, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to their release, as set forth in the membership interest purchase agreement. Accordingly, as provided in the membership interest purchase agreement, we will be obligated to register under the Securities Act the resale of the holdback shares that are ultimately issued to the sellers.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $11.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash was consumed from continuing operations by the net loss of $12.7 million, less non-cash items of $12.0 million, consisting of the impairment of our investment in Coinsquare of $9.4 million, depreciation and amortization totaling $4.5 million, stock-based compensation totaling $3.4 million, impairment to our cryptocurrencies of $1.0 million, and amortization of our right of use assets of $0.4 million, partially offset by a $5.2 million realized gain on the sale / exchange of cryptocurrencies, $1.4 million for the reversal of our accrual for the registration rights penalty, and amortization of our license revenue of $0.1 million. Cryptocurrencies increased by $11.8 million and prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by $0.8 million, offset by, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.9 million and a decrease in our lease liability of $0.4 million.\nIn calculating the right of use asset and lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components as permitted under ASC 842. The Company excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less from the new guidance as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $259.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in connection with our 2019 ATM Offering of $48.0 million and $209.5 million in connection with our 2020 ATM Offering, and proceeds received from the exercise of common stock warrants of $2.9 million, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock to pay director and employee withholding taxes of $0.4 million.\nImpairment of long-term investments of $9.4 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recorded in connection with the impairment of our investment in Coinsquare Ltd., a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange ( Coinsquare\u201d).\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\nUpon completion of the Whinstone Acquisition, we commenced an expansion of our Whinstone Facility to 700 MW, from its existing 300 MW of developed capacity. We expect the expanded Whinstone Facility to be completed during 2022, including the construction of four new dedicated Bitcoin mining buildings totaling approximately 240,000 square feet of finished hosting space. Upon completion, we anticipate our Whinstone Facility will possess sufficient developed electricity power capacity to support an estimated 112,000 Antminer model S19j miners based upon current configurations. We believe the expansion of our Whinstone Facility will provide sufficient capacity to enable us to deploy a significant quantity of our miners (including our current deployed fleet and those expected to be delivered in future shipments pursuant to our purchase orders with Bitmain) in a self-hosted facility, while allowing Whinstone to continue to operate and grow its existing Hosting business. We believe deploying our miners at the expanded Whinstone Facility has many advantages for our mining operations, including allowing us to operate our miners without incurring third-party colocation services fees and to do so at the fixed low energy costs available to the Whinstone Facility under its long-term power supply agreement. We also anticipate this expansion of the Whinstone Facility will provide space for third-party miner colocation services and for other enterprise-level data center hosting services.\nCost of revenues for Engineering for the period from the acquisition of ESS Metron on December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 was $3.6 million and there were no Engineering costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 2021 costs consisted primarily of $3.6 million for direct materials and labor, as well as indirect manufacturing costs.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nVariable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate.\nReconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Information\nBasic net earnings (loss) per share ( EPS\u201d) of common stock is computed by dividing the Company's net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. The Company excludes the unvested restricted share units (RSUs) awarded to its employees, officers, directors, and contractors under the 2019 Equity Plan from this net loss per share calculation because including them would be antidilutive.\nHosting\n 47 \nCryptocurrencies\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized losses related to the issuance of convertible notes of approximately $6.2 million and expenses totaling $6.8 million to revalue the notes and the related warrant liability to fair value.\nThe Company also installs certain hosted customers' mining equipment and bills the customer at a fixed fee per piece of equipment or at an hourly rate. Revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.\nDuring December 2019, the Company purchased 4,000 Bitmain model S17-Pro Antminers for a total purchase price of approximately $6.3 million directly from Bitmain. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company relocated all 4,000 of these miners from its former Oklahoma facility to the Coinmint Facility in Massena, New York.\nOther Income and Expense:\n \nImpairment of long-term investments of $9.4 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recorded in connection with the impairment of our investment in Coinsquare. The Company recorded this 100% impairment as a result of the OSC Order and Settlement Agreement in which Coinsquare and certain of its executives and directors admitted to violations of Ontario securities laws and conduct contrary to the public interest in connection with their operation of the Coinsquare Market.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in connection with our ATM Offering of $23.8 million, the proceeds received from the issuance of Notes and Warrants of $3.0 million in the 2019 Private Financing, partially offset by the repayment of the principal balance related to our agreement with BMSS of $0.9 million, net of the $0.4 million gain recorded on extinguishment of the BMSS balance.\nAt December 31, 2021, our Mining business operated approximately 30,907 ASIC miners, with a hash rate capacity of 3.1 exahash per second ( EH/s\u201d), utilizing approximately 96 megawatts ( MW\u201d) of capacity. In 2021, we mined 3,812 Bitcoin, which represented an increase of 269% over the 1,033 Bitcoin we mined in 2020. Based on our existing operations and expected deliveries of miners pursuant to our purchase orders with their manufacturer, Bitmain, we anticipate we will have approximately 120,150 miners in operation, utilizing approximately 370 MW of capacity by the end of 2022.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n \nSee Note 3 to our financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our financial statements.\n2022 Trends\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company leases its primary office locations, which expire between 2.5 and seven years, manufacturing facilities of ESS Metron, which expire between 3.5 and 10 years and a ground lease at the Whinstone Facility that expires in December 2030, all of which are inclusive of extension options the Company is reasonably certain will be exercised. At December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any significant operating lease balances.\nCost of revenues for Mining for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $45.5 million and $6.3 million, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $39.2 million. As a percentage of Mining revenue, cost of revenues totaled 24.7% and 52.2% for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cost of revenues consist primarily of direct production costs of mining operations, including electricity, labor, insurance and, in 2020, rent for the Oklahoma City facility and, in 2021, the variable Coinmint hosting fee, but excluding depreciation and amortization which are separately stated. The increase of $39.2 million in cost of revenues is primarily due to the increases in variable mining costs, including the variable hosting fees associated with increases in mining revenues.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offerings\nMining revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled approximately $12.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Other revenue consisted of license payments of approximately $0.1 million in each period. Revenues from cryptocurrency mining are impacted significantly by volatility in Bitcoin prices, as well as increases in the Bitcoin blockchain's network hash rate resulting from the growth in the overall quantity and quality of miners working to solve blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain and the difficulty index associated with the secure hashing algorithm employed in solving the blocks.\n 50 \n* Pursuant to the Company's agreements with Bitmain, the Company is responsible for all shipping charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the miners.\nESS Metron\n 34 \nExpected Term - The expected term of options represents the period that the Company's stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified method, which is the half-life from vesting to the end of its contractual term.\nFunding our operations on a go-forward basis will rely significantly on our ability to mine Bitcoin at a price above our Mining costs and revenue generated from our Hosting and Engineering customers. We expect to generate ongoing revenues from Bitcoin rewards from our Mining operations and our ability to liquidate Bitcoin rewards at future values will be evaluated from time-to-time to generate cash for operations.\n\u00b7 Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract;\nAsset Impairment Charges:\n 32 \nIn May 2020, Whinstone entered into a Power Supply Agreement with TXU Energy Retail Company LLC ( TXU\u201d) to provide the delivery of a fixed amount of electricity by TXU to Whinstone (via the facility owned by Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC ( Oncor\u201d)) for a fixed price through April 30, 2030. The Power Supply Agreement provides a consistent and sufficient supply of electricity at the Whinstone Facility. If Whinstone uses more electricity than contracted, the cost of the excess is incurred at the current spot rate. Concurrently, Whinstone entered into a contract with Oncor for the extension of delivery system transmission/substation facilities to facilitate delivery of the electricity to the Whinstone Facility (the Facilities Agreement\u201d). Power costs incurred under this contract are determined on an hourly basis using settlement information provided by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT\u201d) and are recorded in cost of revenues - data center hosting in our consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment of cryptocurrencies for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $36.5 million and $1.0 million respectively, arising from the decline in Bitcoin prices during the periods.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $87.4 million and $10.3 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of stock-based compensation, legal and professional fees and other personnel and related costs. The increase of $77.2 million is primarily due to an increase in stock-compensation expense of $65.1 million resulting from additional awards (including the performance-based plan announced in August 2021), compensation expense, which increased by $5.7 million due to additional employees to support the Company's growth, and an increase in consulting fees of $2.6 million resulting primarily from assistance on internal control systems and procedures.\nGoodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company determined that it has three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes, Bitcoin Mining, Data Center Hosting, and Electrical Products and Engineering, which is consistent with internal management reporting and management's oversight of operations. Goodwill is not amortized and is reviewed for impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We use both qualitative and quantitative analyses in making this determination. Our analyses require significant assumptions and judgments, including assumptions about future economic conditions, revenue growth, and operating margins, among other factors. Example events or changes in circumstances considered in the qualitative analysis, many of which are subjective in nature, include: a significant negative trend in our industry or overall economic trends, a significant change in how we use the acquired assets, a significant change in or our business strategy, a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, a significant change in regulations or in the industry that could affect the value of the asset, and a change in segments. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs the quantitative test to identify and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered impaired and that excess is recognized as a goodwill impairment loss.\nLevel 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Mining revenue was $184.4 million, and $12.0 million, respectively. The increase of $172.4 million in mining revenue was due to higher Bitcoin values in the 2021 period, averaging $45,744 per coin as compared to $11,461 per coin in the 2020 period, combined with a higher number of Bitcoin mined in 2021, which totaled 3,812, as compared to 1,033 in the 2020 period.\n\u00b7 Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer;\nLevel 3 - assets and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable.\nGlobal supply logistics have caused delays across all channels of distribution. Similarly, we have also experienced delays in certain of our miner delivery schedules. During 2021, we have been able to effectively mitigate any delivery delays to avoid materially impacting our miner deployment schedule, however, there are no assurances we will be able to continue to mitigate any such delivery delays in 2022. Additionally, the scale of the Whinstone expansion requires large quantities of specific materials. We have procured and hold many of the required materials to help mitigate against global supply logistic and pricing concerns. We monitor developments in the global supply chain and how that may potentially impact our expansion plans. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of our Annual Report for additional discussion regarding potential impacts the global supply chain crisis may have on our operations and plans for expansion.\nOperating Activities\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management's best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company entered into purchase agreements with Bitmain for the acquisition of a total of 33,646 of their model S19, S19-Pro, and S19j-Pro Antminer series of miners, to be shipped and delivered during 2020 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received 3,043 model S19 Antminers of these 33,646 new miners, all of which were deployed at the Coinmint Facility. The remaining 30,603 of these new miners were delivered in monthly shipments through January 2022.\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. A committee consisting of the Company's executives is determined to be the CODM. The Company has three operating segments as of December 31, 2021. See Note 18, Segment Information\u201d.\n 44 \nThe demand response services program ( Demand Response Service\u201d) provides the ERCOT market with valuable reliability and economic services by helping to preserve system reliability, enhancing competition, mitigating price spikes, and encouraging the demand side of the market to respond better to wholesale price signals. In collaboration with market participants such as the Company, ERCOT has developed demand response products and services for customers that have the ability to reduce or modify electricity use in response to instructions or signals. Market participants with electrical loads like Whinstone may participate in the Demand Response Service program directly by offering their electrical loads into the ERCOT markets, or indirectly by voluntarily reducing their energy usage in response to increasing wholesale prices.\n 51 \nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOn April 8, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Coinmint (the Coinmint Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Coinmint agreed to provide up to approximately 9.5 MW of electrical power and to perform all maintenance necessary to operate Riot's miners deployed at the Coinmint Facility. In exchange, Coinmint is reimbursed for direct production expenses and receives a performance fee based on the net cryptocurrencies generated by Riot's miners deployed at the Coinmint Facility. The amount of electrical power supplied to Riot's miners at the Coinmint Facility has subsequently been increased to accommodate Riot's expanding miner fleet. However, no formal written amendment to the Coinmint Agreement solidifying Riot's continuing access to sufficient power to operate its expanding fleet of miners has been entered into with Coinmint. The initial term of the Coinmint Agreement was six months, with automatic renewals for subsequent three month terms until terminated as provided in the agreement.\nLegal Proceedings\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to net income, the comparable measure under U.S. GAAP. Further, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to revenue growth, net income, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nATM Offering\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, stock-based compensation and business combinations.\nWe operate in three business segments: (1) Bitcoin Mining ( Mining\u201d), (2) Data Center Hosting ( Hosting\u201d), and (3) Electrical Products and Engineering ( Engineering\u201d).\n 48 \nAcquisition-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $21.2 million and consisted of expenses incurred in connection with our acquisitions of Whinstone and ESS Metron. There were no acquisition-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n 49 \nFor the period from the acquisition of ESS Metron on December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, Engineering revenue was $4.2 million, and there was no Engineering revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Engineering revenue is derived from the sale of custom products built to customers' specifications under fixed-price contracts with one identified performance obligation. Engineering revenues are recognized over time as performance creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and for which the Company has an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract.\nLeases\n\u00b7 Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has been unpredictable and unprecedented and is likely to continue to result in significant national and global economic disruption, which may adversely affect our business. Based on our current assessment, however, we do not expect any material impact on our long-term development, our operations, or our liquidity due to the worldwide spread of COVID-19, other than the potential impacts of COVID-19 on global logistics discussed below. We are actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, and industry.\nElectrical Products and Engineering\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $32.8 million, consisting of proceeds received from the sale of cryptocurrencies of $8.3 million and proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment of $0.1 million, partially offset by deposits on equipment of $33.1 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $8.1 million.\n 43 \nEngineering\nThe Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies the Company has adopted. In order to get a full understanding of the Company's financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed. A summary of the Company's critical accounting policies follows:\nThe Acquisition of ESS Metron provides us with the ability to vertically integrate many of the critical electrical components and engineering services necessary for our Whinstone expansion. A key component of our strategy is to integrate the expertise of the ESS Metron team, which we believe is necessary to reduce our execution and counter-party risk in ongoing and future expansion projects. ESS Metron's engineers will also allow us to continue to explore new methods to optimize and develop a best-in-class Bitcoin mining operation, and they have been instrumental in the development of our industrial-scale immersion-cooled Bitcoin mining hardware. ESS Metron also has an existing electricity distribution product design, manufacture, and installation business primarily focused on large-scale commercial and governmental customers.\nIncome Taxes:\n 33 \n 41 \nChanges in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management's assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts, and therefore, profit and revenue recognition. Any costs to obtain a contract are not material to the Company's financial statements and would be expensed as incurred. Because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change within the near term. The length of time for the Company to complete a custom product varies but is typically between four to 12 weeks.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period-to-period by making such adjustments.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a gain of approximately $1.1 million on the deconsolidation of Tess, due to our reduced ownership interest from 50.2% to 8.8%. No such expense was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nExpected Volatility - The Company computes stock price volatility over expected terms based on its historical common stock trading prices.\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized income of approximately $1.4 million in connection with the reversal of our registration rights penalty.\nData Center Hosting\nThe Company accounts for financial instruments under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820\u201d). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.\nWe have considered recently issued accounting pronouncements and do not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues:\nIn November 2021, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord of certain Whinstone abandoned leases for approximately $0.9 million. After eliminating the associated operating lease liabilities, we recognized other income of approximately $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n 37 \nATM Offering\nExpected Dividend - The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common shares and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in its valuation models.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n 42 \nSubstantially all revenue is derived from the sale of custom products built to customers' specifications under fixed-price contracts with one identified performance obligation. Revenues are recognized over time as performance creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and for which the Company has an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract.\nThe Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company's financial reporting, the Company undertakes a review to determine the consequences of the change to its financial statements and believes that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company's financial statements properly reflect the change.\n \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on the sale / exchange of cryptocurrencies of approximately $5.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019 the gain on sale of cryptocurrencies was $0.7 million.\nOur investment in marketable equity securities consists entirely of common shares of Mogo, Inc. (NASDAQ: MOGO), resulting from the April and May 2021 transactions. (See Note 7, Investments in Marketable Equity Securities\u201d). The Company accounted for this investment in accordance with ASC 321, Investments-Equity Securities, ( ASC 321\u201d) due to the shares having a readily determinable fair value since they are traded on NASDAQ and have significant average daily volume traded. As a result, the investment is required to be measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in other income (expense).\n\nCryptocurrencies (primarily Bitcoin) are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The classification of cryptocurrencies as a current asset has been made after the Company's consideration of the significant consistent daily trading volume on readily available cryptocurrency exchanges, there are no limitations or restrictions on Company's ability to sell Bitcoin and the pattern of actual sales of Bitcoin by the Company. Cryptocurrencies purchased are recorded at cost and cryptocurrencies awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company's revenue recognition policy disclosed below.\n2019 ATM Offering\n\nInvestment in marketable equity securities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income and interest expense was nominal.\nESS Metron is one of the world's leading designers and manufacturers of power distribution equipment. The acquisition of ESS Metron provides critical infrastructure electrical components and engineering expertise to facilitate the expansion of our Whinstone Facility, as well as future strategic growth initiatives we may undertake. ESS Metron has also been instrumental in the design, manufacture, and implementation of our industrial-scale immersion-cooled Bitcoin mining hardware at our Whinstone Facility.\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d). Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right of use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right of use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right of use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\n \nCosts and expenses:\nThe MD&A generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020, as well as year-to-year discussions between 2021, 2020, and 2019, where indicated. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations\u201d in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 31, 2021.\nTotal revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $213.2 million and $12.1 million, respectively, and consisted of our Mining revenue, Hosting revenue, Engineering revenue, and other revenue.\nAs of October 15, 2020, the Company and H.C. Wainwright entered into the first amendment to the Sales Agreement (the First Amendment to the Sales Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the First Amendment to the Sales Agreement, the Company sold, through H.C. Wainwright as its sales agent, $100.0 million in shares of the Company's common stock in an at-the-market offering (the October 2020 ATM Offering\u201d). The Company paid H.C. Wainwright a commission of up to 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds the Company received from all sales of its common stock in the October 2020 ATM Offering.\nWhinstone currently hosts Bitcoin mining operations for institutional-scale mining customers. In addition to Hosting revenue from customers, Whinstone also generates, as part of its Hosting revenue, construction services revenue from hosting customers on site, including revenue derived from the fabrication and deployment of immersion-cooling technology for Bitcoin mining.\n \nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.2 million, consisting of proceeds from the sale of cryptocurrencies of $3.2 million, offset by $5.0 million for the purchase of Bitmain S17-Pro Antminers and deposits on equipment of $1.4 million.\nDuring 2021, we entered into six purchase agreements with Bitmain to acquire 52,500 Antminer model S19j (90 Terahash per second) ( TH/s\u201d) miners and 30,000 of their latest Antminer model S19XP (140 TH/s) miners for a combined total purchase price of approximately $535.0 million. Pursuant to these agreements, approximately $301.3 million remains payable to Bitmain in installments in advance of shipment of the miners, which is scheduled to occur on a monthly basis through December 2022. Of the remaining miners to be delivered, 48,495 new S19j-Pro model miners and 30,000 new S19XP model miners are all scheduled to be delivered throughout the year ended December 31, 2022.\n ", "item_7_text": "The following table presents additional information about our Mining activities, including cryptocurrency production and sales of the cryptocurrency the Company mined during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 ($ in thousands):\nIn general, we provide power for our data center customers on a variable (sub-metered) basis. A customer pays us variable monthly fees for the specific amount of power utilized at rates specified in each contract, subject to certain minimums. We recognize variable power revenue each month as the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved, power is provided to our customers, and our customers utilize the power (the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company's performance).\nFor the period from the acquisition of Whinstone on May 26, 2021 to December 31, 2021, Hosting revenue was $24.5 million, and there was no Hosting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Hosting revenue includes upfront payments, which we record as deferred revenue and generally recognize as services are provided. We provide energized space and operating and maintenance services to third-party mining companies who locate their mining hardware at our Whinstone Facility under long-term contracts. We account for these agreements as a single performance obligation for services being delivered in a series with delivery being measured by daily successful operation of the mining hardware. As such, we recognize revenue over the life of the contract as its series of performance obligations are met. The contracts are recognized in the amount for which we have the right to invoice because we elected the right to invoice\u201d practical expedient.\nFor a more detailed discussion of our At-the-Market Equity Offerings, see Note 12, Stockholders' Equity\u201d, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther revenue is revenue recognized from an upfront license fee generated from our legacy animal health business. The upfront fee was recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized into revenue over the term of the License Agreement.\n 38 \n \nIn August 2021, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., B. Riley FBR, Inc., BTIG, LLC, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the Sales Agents\u201d) dated August 31, 2021 (the Sales Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which we sold $600 million in shares of our common stock through the Sales Agents, acting as our sales agent and/or principal, in a continuous at-the-market offering (the 2021 ATM Offering\u201d). All sales of the shares in connection with the ATM Offering were made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-259212) filed with the SEC on August 31, 2021. During the period August 31, 2021 to December 31, 2021, we received gross proceeds of $600 million ($587.2 million, net of $12.8 million in commissions paid to the Sales Agents and expenses) from the sale of 19,910,589 shares of our common stock, with an average fair value of $29.53 per share, in the 2021 ATM Offering. As of December 31, 2021, all $600 million in shares of our common stock registered under the December 2021 Registration Statement had been issued and, accordingly, we completed the 2021 ATM Offering.\nSegment and Reporting Unit Information\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $665.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in connection with our ATM Offerings of $669.9 million and proceeds received from the exercise of common stock warrants of $0.8 million, partially offset by the shares of common stock withheld to satisfy employee withholding taxes of $5.1 million in connection with the settlement of vested equity awards granted under our 2019 Equity Plan.\nOur primary hosting contracts contain Service Level Agreement clauses, which guarantee a certain percentage of time the power will be available to our customer. In the rare case that we may incur penalties under these clauses, we account for payments made to customers in accordance with ASC 606-10-32-25, Consideration Payable to a Customer, which requires the payment be recognized as variable consideration and a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore, of revenue, when not in exchange for a good or service from the customer.\n \nFair value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the market rate of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt.\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, ( ASC 805\u201d) in the accounting for acquisitions of businesses. ASC 805 requires us to use the acquisition method of accounting by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business, measured at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the aforementioned amounts. Contingent consideration is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value as of each reporting date until the contingency is resolved, and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Contingent consideration is recorded in long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFrom early 2019 to the end of 2020 the Bitcoin blockchain's network hash rate increased by approximately 249% as a result of, among other factors, the increased number of miners working to solve blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain during that period, many of which make use of newer, more efficient ASIC chips that are specially designed to solve blocks using the SHA-256 set of cryptographic hash functions employed on the Bitcoin blockchain. For years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average network hash rate working on the Bitcoin blockchain was 142.74 EH/s and 98.67 EH/s, respectively. Further, the difficulty index increased over 231% in the past two fiscal years. The cumulative difficulty index increase over each of years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 43.79% and 97.67%, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $10.3 million, which is an approximately $1.1 million, or a 11.9% increase, as compared to $9.2 million in the 2019 period. Compensation related expense decreased by approximately $0.6 million due primarily to staff reductions during 2019, net of severance costs and the compensation expense of $0.3 for Tess Pay, Inc. ( Tess\u201d) in the 2019 period, which in 2020 is no longer reported in our consolidated financial statements. Stock-based compensation increased by approximately $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the 2019 period due to the 2020 issuance of 1,544,359 restricted stock units and the accelerated vesting of 471,544 restricted stock units due to the resignation of a member of the Company's board. Legal fees decreased by approximately $0.6 million due to legal matters associated primarily with the fees for the class action and derivative suits and special SEC related matters being higher in the 2019 period. Audit fees decreased approximately $0.3 million due to the higher level of financial activities and the audit of internal controls over financial reporting incurred for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are comprised of customer contracts that are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which is their contractual term. The Company performs assessments to determine whether finite-lived classification is still appropriate at least annually. The carrying value of finite-lived assets and their remaining useful lives are also reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist which may indicate a potential impairment or revision to the amortization period. A finite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired if its carrying value exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from it. We exercise judgment in selecting the assumptions used in the estimated future undiscounted cash flows analysis. Impairment is measured by the amount that the carrying value exceeds fair value.\nStrategic Acquisitions\nMiner Purchases and Deployments\nCOVID-19\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from our Mining operations, Hosting operations or Engineering operations when needed or secure additional sources of funding, it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending or explore other strategic alternatives.\nThe Company elected to account for forfeited awards as they occur, as permitted by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-09. Ultimately, the actual expenses recognized over the vesting period will be for those shares that vested.\nCustomers are typically required to make periodic progress payments to the Company based on contractually agreed-upon milestones. Invoices are due net, 30 days, and retainage, if any, is generally due 30 days after delivery. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.\nPurchases of cryptocurrencies by the Company are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, while cryptocurrencies awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The sales of cryptocurrencies are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and any realized gains or losses from such sales are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first in first out (FIFO) method of accounting.\n \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2021, we had purchased, received and/or deployed the following miners:\nNet cash used in operating activities was $86.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash was consumed from operations by a net loss of $7.9 million, less non-cash items of $108.9 million, consisting primarily of a realized gain on the sale/exchange of long-term investment of $26.3 million and the change in fair value of our derivative asset of $12.1 million, partially offset by stock-based compensation expense of $68.5 million, the impairment of cryptocurrencies of $36.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $26.3 million, an unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of $13.7 million, the issuance of common stock warrants of $1.2 million, and income tax expense of $0.3 million, net of other immaterial items. The change in assets and liabilities of $187.3 million consisted primarily of increased cryptocurrencies of $184.4 million, increased accounts receivable of $4.4 million, increased security deposits of $3.2 million, decreased costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $3.3 million, increased prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.9 million, increased accounts payable and accrued expenses of $13.3 million, change in fair value of future power credits of $1.0 million, increased customer deposits of $6.1 million, decreased deferred revenue of $12.9 million, decreased lease liabilities of $1.7 million and decreased billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings of $0.6 million.\n 35 \nBusiness Combinations\nGenerating Bitcoin rewards, for example, which exceed our production and overhead costs will determine our ability to report profit margins related to such mining operations, although accounting for our reported profitability is significantly complex. Furthermore, regardless of our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our Bitcoin from our Mining business, we may need to raise additional capital in the form of equity or debt to fund our operations and pursue our business strategy.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we received net proceeds of approximately $257.5 million (after deducting $7.3 million in commissions and expenses) from sales of 49,932,051 shares of its common stock, no par value, at a weighted average gross sales price of $5.30 per share pursuant to an At-The-Market Sales Agreement, dated effective as of May 24, 2019, as amended (the 2019 ATM Sales Agreement\u201d), with its sales agent, H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC ( Wainwright\u201d).\n 46 \nImpairment charges for cryptocurrencies was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was recorded to recognize an impairment of our cryptocurrencies during the three months ended March 31, 2020.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:\nAfter closing the Whinstone Acquisition, we announced a large-scale expansion of the Whinstone Facility by 400 MW, which is anticipated to bring the Whinstone Facility to 700 MW in total capacity of Bitcoin mining infrastructure. The expansion of the Whinstone Facility will provide us with the necessary infrastructure to operate our miners efficiently, and deploy our future miners, as well as provide additional expansion opportunities in our Hosting business.\nPower Supply Contract and Demand Response Services\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $490.3 million, primarily consisting of deposits on equipment of $274.8 million, our acquisition of Whinstone of $40.9 million, net, our acquisition of ESS Metron of $29.6 million, net, and purchases of property and equipment of $147.1 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1.8 million received for our Coinsquare investment.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nDepreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $26.3 million, which is an increase of approximately $21.8 million, as compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher depreciation expense recognized for the Whinstone Facility and our recently acquired miners.\nIf a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company recorded an income tax expense of $0.3 million. There was no income tax expense or benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe ability to raise funds through the sale of equity, debt financings, or the sale of Bitcoin to maintain our operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and, even if we were successful, future equity issuances or convertible debt offerings could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and any future debt or debt securities may contain covenants that limit our operations or ability to enter into certain transactions. Our ability to realize revenue through Bitcoin production and successfully convert Bitcoin into cash or fund overhead with Bitcoin is subject to a number of risks, including regulatory, financial and business risks, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, we have observed significant historical volatility in the market price of Bitcoin and, as such, future prices cannot be predicted. See the discussion of risks affecting our business under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\nFair value of financial instruments\nOther Income:\n \nStock Based Compensation\nRevenue Recognition\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDeferred revenue is primarily from advance payments received and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the contract or upon completion of the installation of the customers' equipment.\nThe Company has been named a defendant in several class action and other investor related lawsuits as more fully described in Part I, Item 3., Legal Proceedings\u201d, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While the Company maintains policies of insurance, such policies may not cover all of the costs or expenses associated with responding to such matters or any liability or settlement associated with any lawsuits and are subject to significant deductible or retention amounts.\nContractual Commitments\nDuring 2021, we received 34,608 additional Antminer model S19-Pro miners pursuant to purchase orders with their manufacturer, Bitmain, and, as of December 31, 2021, we had deployed a total of 30,907 miners in our Mining operation. Additionally, we executed six additional purchase orders with Bitmain to acquire 43,500 Antminer model S19j (90 Terahash per second) ( TH/s\u201d)) miners, and 9,000 Antminer model S19j-Pro (100 TH/s) miners, and 30,000 of Bitmain's latest generation Antminer model S19XP (140 TH/s) miners, for a combined total purchase price of approximately $535.0 million. Pursuant to these agreements, approximately $301.3 million remains payable to Bitmain in installments in advance of shipment of the miners, which is scheduled to occur on a monthly basis through December 2022.\nFrom the May 26, 2021 acquisition date through December 31, 2021, Hosting revenue and net income was approximately $24.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Additionally, the majority of our $22.6 million of deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 is related to advance payments made by Whinstone customers, which will be primarily recognized over the remaining lives of the underlying contracts, or approximately eight years.\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $6.3 million consisted primarily of direct production costs of the mining operations, including rent and utilities and fees paid to Coinmint pursuant to the Coinmint Agreement, but excluding depreciation and amortization, which are separately stated. The cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $6.1 million. The cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as a percentage of mining revenue totaled 52.2% and 90.4%, respectively. The improvement in 2020 resulted from higher average Bitcoin values for mined Bitcoin and lower fixed and variable costs incurred for costs of revenue for the second half of 2020 following the relocation to the Coinmint Facility.\nBitcoin Mining\nIn April 2021, under the provisions of the TXU Power Supply Agreement, and as a result of the weather event, Whinstone entered into a Qualified Scheduling Entity ( QSE\u201d) Letter Agreement, which resulted in Whinstone being entitled to receive approximately $125.1 million for its power sales during the February winter storm, all under the terms and conditions of the QSE Letter Agreement. Whinstone received cash of $29.0 million in April 2021 (after deducting $10.0 million in power management fees owed by Whinstone), approximately $59.7 million is scheduled to be credited against future power bills of Whinstone beginning in 2022 and the remaining $26.3 million is contingent upon ERCOT's future remittance. These amounts are gross before fair value adjustments and expenses incurred by Whinstone for power management fees noted above and customer settlements. The fair value of the settlement agreement was estimated and recognized as an asset as part of acquisition accounting. Additionally, pursuant to the Northern Data stock purchase agreement, the Company agreed to pay Seller additional consideration in cash in the amount of the future power credits, net of income taxes, when and if realized by Whinstone. See Note 4, Acquisitions\u201d.\nThe Company accounts for share-based payment awards exchanged for services at the estimated grant date fair value of the award. Stock options issued under the Company's equity incentive plans are granted with an exercise price equal to no less than the market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant and expire up to ten years from the date of grant. These options generally vest on the grant date or over a one- year period.\nCost of revenues for Hosting for the period from the acquisition of Whinstone on May 26, 2021 to December 31, 2021 was $33.0 million and there were no Hosting costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 2021 costs consisted primarily of $25.8 million for direct power costs, with the balance primarily incurred for compensation and rent costs.\nWe anticipate that 2022 will be a year of consolidation in the Bitcoin mining industry, and we believe that, given our relative position in the competitive landscape, we are likely positioned to benefit from this consolidation. As a result of any strategic action undertaken by us, our business and financial results may change significantly. We are continuously evaluating strategic opportunities we may decide to undertake as part of our strategic growth initiatives; however, we can offer no assurances that any strategic opportunities we decide to undertake will be achieved on the schedule or within the budget we anticipate, if at all, in our competitive and evolving industry. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for additional discussion regarding potential impacts our competitive and evolving industry may have on our business.\nObservable inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company's market assumptions. Unobservable inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. In some cases, the inputs used to measure an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is required to be classified using the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Such determination requires significant management judgment. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had derivative assets and contingent consideration liability measured at fair value. As of December 31, 2020, there were no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The carrying amounts of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nEarnings (loss) per share\nThe Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts, as amended from time to time, with the mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and the Company's enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are immaterial and are recorded as a deduction from revenue), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain. The terms of the agreement provide that neither party can dispute settlement terms after thirty-five days following settlement. The Company's fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.\nRevenues:\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIn addition to consolidated U.S. GAAP financial measures, we consistently evaluate our use and calculation of the non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure defined as our EBITDA, adjusted to eliminate the effects of certain non-cash and / or non-recurring items, that do not reflect our ongoing strategic business operations. EBITDA is computed as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted, for certain income and expenses, management believes results in a performance measurement that represents a key indicator of the Company's core business operations of Bitcoin mining. The adjustments include fair value adjustments such as derivative power contract adjustments, equity securities value changes, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, in addition to financing and legacy business income and expense items. In 2021, we included impairments of cryptocurrencies and gain or losses on sales of cryptocurrencies as part of our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Based upon recent SEC comments to another issuer, we have determined to exclude impairments of cryptocurrencies and gain or losses on sales of cryptocurrencies from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to evaluate the positions of FASB and SEC on the accounting treatment of cryptocurrencies.\n \nOn May 26, 2021, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Whinstone US, Inc. ( Whinstone\u201d) pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, dated as of April 8, 2021, we entered into with Northern Data AG ( Northern Data\u201d) and Whinstone (the Whinstone Acquisition\u201d). At the closing of the Whinstone Acquisition, we paid to Northern Data $80 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the stock purchase agreement, and issued to Northern Data 11.8 million shares of our common stock. We also entered into a shareholder agreement with Northern Data on the closing date granting Northern Data certain registration rights whereby we registered the 11.8 million shares issued to Northern Data as part of the Whinstone Acquisition. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, there were no registration rights obligations to Northern Data.\nProviding computing power to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the Bitcoin blockchain (in a process known as solving a block\u201d) is an output of the Company's ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in the Company's contracts with mining pool operators. The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time the Company has earned the award from the pools. The consideration is all variable. Because it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur, the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and the Company receives confirmation of the consideration it will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $4.5 million, which is an increase of approximately $4.4 million, compared to $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher average depreciable equipment levels in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting from the Company's acquisition of 7,043 new miners, which the Company depreciates over their two-year estimated usable lives using the straight-line method.\nThe Company also terminated two former operating leases during the year ended December 31, 2020: (i) the lease of the Oklahoma facility and (ii) the Florida lease, both of which are discussed under Prior Leases\u201d above.\nWhinstone\nCryptocurrencies held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the cryptocurrency at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.\nOther Revenue\nNet cash used in operating activities was $15.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash was consumed from the net loss of $20.3 million, less non-cash items of $14.7 million, including a loss on the issuance of our convertible notes, common stock and warrants of $6.2 million, the change in fair value of our convertible notes and the related warrant liability of $6.8 million, amortization of our right of use assets of $2.3 million, stock-based compensation totaling $0.7 million, impairment to our cryptocurrencies of $0.8 million, an impairment of intangible assets acquired of $0.7 million related to our decision not to pursue our Logical Brokerage business, net of deferred income tax benefit of $0.1 million, and depreciation and amortization totaling $0.1 million, offset by a $1.1 million gain recognized on the deconsolidation of Tess, a $0.9 million gain on the extinguishment of notes, interest and accounts payable, other income of approximately $0.1 million, primarily related to the amortization of our deferred revenue related to our legacy animal health business and a $0.7 million related to the gain from the sale of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies increased by $6.6 million, offset by, a decrease in our lease liability of $2.3 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.8 million.\n 45 \n \n 40 \n \nResults of Operations Comparative Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n 39 \nSummary of Mining Results\nAccounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include; future expected cash flows from customer contracts, discount rates, and estimated market changes in the value of the Power Supply Agreement, which is accounted for as a nonhedged derivative contract. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded income tax benefits of zero and $0.1 million, respectively.\nMiners\nGlobal Logistics\n 36 \nMining\nWe have determined that our contracts contain a series of performance obligations which qualify to be recognized under a practical expedient available known as the right to invoice.\u201d This determination allows variable consideration in such contracts to be allocated to and recognized in the period to which the consideration relates, which is typically the period in which it is billed, rather than requiring estimation of variable consideration at the inception of the contract. We have also determined that the contracts contain a significant financing component because the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing by a period, exceeding one year.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had working capital of approximately $463.7 million, which included cash and cash equivalents of $312.3 million. We reported a net loss of $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Net loss included $108.9 million in non-cash items consisting primarily of a realized gain on the sale/exchange of long-term investment of $26.3 million and the change in fair value of our derivative asset of $12.1 million, offset by stock-based compensation expense of $68.5 million, the impairment of cryptocurrencies of $36.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $26.3 million, an unrealized loss on marketable securities of $13.7 million, the issuance of common stock warrants of $1.2 million and income tax expense of $0.3 million.\nCoinmint Co-location Mining Services Agreement\nMaintenance services include cleaning, cabling and other services to maintain the customers' equipment. We bill the customer at a fixed monthly fee or at an hourly rate. Revenue is recognized as these services are provided.\n\nAsset impairment charges of $1.5 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 and were related to $0.8 million for the impairment of our cryptocurrencies accounted for as intangible assets and $0.7 million related to our intangible assets acquired in connection with our former RiotX / Logical Brokerage business.\nRevenue from Operations\nIn order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606's definition of a distinct\u201d good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct), and the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\n \nWhile we manage operating costs at the Whinstone Facility in part by periodically selling unused or uneconomical power in the market back to ERCOT, we do not consider such actions trading activities. That is, we do not engage in speculation in the power market as part of our ordinary activities. Because the Demand Response Services programs allow for net settlement, we have determined the Power Supply Agreement meets the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, ( ASC 815\u201d). However, because we have the ability to sell the power back to the grid rather than take physical delivery, physical delivery is not probable through the entirety of the contract and therefore, we do not believe the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception applies to the Power Supply Agreement. Accordingly, the Power Supply Agreement (the non-hedging derivative contract) is recorded at estimated fair value each reporting period with the change in the fair value recorded in change in fair value of derivative asset in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCost and Expenses:\nIn February 2021, the State of Texas experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event that resulted in prolonged freezing temperatures and caused an electricity generation shortage that was severely disruptive to the whole state. While demand for electricity reached extraordinary levels due to the extreme cold, the supply of electricity significantly decreased in part because of the inability of certain power generation facilities to supply electric power to the grid. Due to the extreme market price of electricity during this time, at the request of ERCOT, Whinstone stopped supplying power to its customers and instead sold power back to the grid.\nWe generate engineering and construction services revenue from the fabrication and deployment of immersion cooling technology for Bitcoin mining customers. We bill the customer at a fixed monthly fee or at an hourly rate. For the construction of customer-owned equipment, revenue is recognized upon completion of each phase of the construction project, as defined in each contract. For construction of assets owned by Whinstone but paid for and used by the customer during the term of their hosting contract, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the contract.\nOther income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $14.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The increase of $13.2 million is primarily related to a $26.3 million realized gain on the sale/exchange of long-term investment recognized in connection with the exchange of our shares of Coinsquare, partially offset by a $13.7 million unrealized loss on the decline in fair value our marketable equity securities.\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was nominal. Other income was approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a $0.4 million gain on forgiveness of our payable and interest in connection with our former agreement with BMSS, and a $0.5 million gain on forgiveness of various accounts payable balances.\nDepreciation and Amortization:\nWe operate in an environment which is consistently evolving based on the proliferation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. A significant component of our strategy is to effectively and efficiently allocate capital between opportunities that generate the highest return on capital.\nLevel 2 - observable inputs other than Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and\nReconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial metric for historical periods are presented in the table below:\n \nIncome Taxes:\nDerivative Accounting\nBusiness Overview:\n \nWe are a vertically integrated Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency infrastructure development company principally engaged in enhancing our capabilities to mine Bitcoin. We also provide the critical mining infrastructure for our institutional scale clients to mine Bitcoin at our Bitcoin mining facility (the Whinstone Facility\u201d). Our Whinstone Facility is believed to be the largest Bitcoin mining facility, as measured by developed capacity, in North America.\nDuring January 2021, in connection with the Second Amendment to the At-the-Market Sales Agreement, as amended, with our sales agent under such agreement, H.C. Wainwright, we received gross proceeds of approximately $84.8 million ($82.7 million net, after $2.1 million in expenses) from the sale of 4,433,468 shares of common stock, with an average fair value of $19.13 per share pursuant to the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-251149) filed with the SEC on December 4, 2020 (the December 2020 ATM Offering\u201d). With the sale and issuance of these shares and of the shares previously sold and issued during the year ended December 31, 2020, all $200 million in shares of our common stock registered under the December 2020 Registration Statement had been issued and we completed the December 2020 ATM Offering. Under the terms of the December 2020 ATM Offering, only shares of our common stock were issued.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately apply preliminary values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had the following contractual commitments (in thousands):\n\u00b7 Step 3: Determine the transaction price;\n\u00b7 Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate - The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U. S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.\n \nTo determine the amount of revenue to recognize over time, the Company utilizes the cost-to-cost method as management believes cost incurred best represents the amount of work completed and remaining on projects. As the cost-to-cost method is driven by incurred cost, the Company calculates the percentage of completion by dividing costs incurred to date by the total estimated cost. The percentage of completion is then multiplied by estimated revenues to determine inception-to-date revenue. Approved changes to design plans are generally recognized as an adjustment to the percentage of completion calculation on a catch-up basis. Revenue recognized for the period is the current inception-to-date recognized revenue less the prior period inception-to-date recognized revenue. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined, and the amount of the loss is updated in subsequent reporting periods. Additionally, contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract.\n \nResults of Operations Comparative Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nRecently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements\nOther revenue consisting of license fees earned from our legacy animal bioscience business was not significant in either period.\nChange in fair value of our derivative asset for the period from the acquisition of Whinstone to December 31, 2021, was $18.6 million, including $12.1 million recorded to adjust the fair value of our Power Supply Agreement, which was classified as a derivative asset and measured at fair value on the date of our acquisition of Whinstone, and $6.5 million from power sales to ERCOT through its demand response programs. There were no derivative assets for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity interests (the ESS Metron Acquisition\u201d) of Ferrie Franzmann Industries, LLC (d/b/a ESS Metron) ( ESS Metron\u201d). At the closing of the ESS Metron Acquisition, we issued to the sellers $25 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the membership interest purchase agreement, and 715,413 shares of our common stock, subject to a holdback of 70,165 shares as security for the sellers' indemnification obligations under the membership interest purchase agreement. We also granted the sellers certain registration rights relating to the resale by the sellers of the shares issued to them under the membership interest purchase agreement, among other things. Pursuant to these registration rights, we registered the resale of the 645,248 shares issued to the sellers at the closing of the ESS Metron Acquisition pursuant to the prospectus supplement we filed with the SEC on December 1, 2021 under our effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on August 31, 2021 (File No. 333-259212). These registration rights also apply to the 70,165 holdback shares withheld at closing of the ESS Metron Acquisition, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to their release, as set forth in the membership interest purchase agreement. Accordingly, as provided in the membership interest purchase agreement, we will be obligated to register under the Securities Act the resale of the holdback shares that are ultimately issued to the sellers.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $11.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash was consumed from continuing operations by the net loss of $12.7 million, less non-cash items of $12.0 million, consisting of the impairment of our investment in Coinsquare of $9.4 million, depreciation and amortization totaling $4.5 million, stock-based compensation totaling $3.4 million, impairment to our cryptocurrencies of $1.0 million, and amortization of our right of use assets of $0.4 million, partially offset by a $5.2 million realized gain on the sale / exchange of cryptocurrencies, $1.4 million for the reversal of our accrual for the registration rights penalty, and amortization of our license revenue of $0.1 million. Cryptocurrencies increased by $11.8 million and prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by $0.8 million, offset by, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.9 million and a decrease in our lease liability of $0.4 million.\nIn calculating the right of use asset and lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components as permitted under ASC 842. The Company excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less from the new guidance as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $259.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in connection with our 2019 ATM Offering of $48.0 million and $209.5 million in connection with our 2020 ATM Offering, and proceeds received from the exercise of common stock warrants of $2.9 million, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock to pay director and employee withholding taxes of $0.4 million.\nImpairment of long-term investments of $9.4 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recorded in connection with the impairment of our investment in Coinsquare Ltd., a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange ( Coinsquare\u201d).\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\nUpon completion of the Whinstone Acquisition, we commenced an expansion of our Whinstone Facility to 700 MW, from its existing 300 MW of developed capacity. We expect the expanded Whinstone Facility to be completed during 2022, including the construction of four new dedicated Bitcoin mining buildings totaling approximately 240,000 square feet of finished hosting space. Upon completion, we anticipate our Whinstone Facility will possess sufficient developed electricity power capacity to support an estimated 112,000 Antminer model S19j miners based upon current configurations. We believe the expansion of our Whinstone Facility will provide sufficient capacity to enable us to deploy a significant quantity of our miners (including our current deployed fleet and those expected to be delivered in future shipments pursuant to our purchase orders with Bitmain) in a self-hosted facility, while allowing Whinstone to continue to operate and grow its existing Hosting business. We believe deploying our miners at the expanded Whinstone Facility has many advantages for our mining operations, including allowing us to operate our miners without incurring third-party colocation services fees and to do so at the fixed low energy costs available to the Whinstone Facility under its long-term power supply agreement. We also anticipate this expansion of the Whinstone Facility will provide space for third-party miner colocation services and for other enterprise-level data center hosting services.\nCost of revenues for Engineering for the period from the acquisition of ESS Metron on December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 was $3.6 million and there were no Engineering costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 2021 costs consisted primarily of $3.6 million for direct materials and labor, as well as indirect manufacturing costs.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nVariable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate.\nReconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Information\nBasic net earnings (loss) per share ( EPS\u201d) of common stock is computed by dividing the Company's net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. The Company excludes the unvested restricted share units (RSUs) awarded to its employees, officers, directors, and contractors under the 2019 Equity Plan from this net loss per share calculation because including them would be antidilutive.\nHosting\n 47 \nCryptocurrencies\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized losses related to the issuance of convertible notes of approximately $6.2 million and expenses totaling $6.8 million to revalue the notes and the related warrant liability to fair value.\nThe Company also installs certain hosted customers' mining equipment and bills the customer at a fixed fee per piece of equipment or at an hourly rate. Revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.\nDuring December 2019, the Company purchased 4,000 Bitmain model S17-Pro Antminers for a total purchase price of approximately $6.3 million directly from Bitmain. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company relocated all 4,000 of these miners from its former Oklahoma facility to the Coinmint Facility in Massena, New York.\nOther Income and Expense:\n \nImpairment of long-term investments of $9.4 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recorded in connection with the impairment of our investment in Coinsquare. The Company recorded this 100% impairment as a result of the OSC Order and Settlement Agreement in which Coinsquare and certain of its executives and directors admitted to violations of Ontario securities laws and conduct contrary to the public interest in connection with their operation of the Coinsquare Market.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in connection with our ATM Offering of $23.8 million, the proceeds received from the issuance of Notes and Warrants of $3.0 million in the 2019 Private Financing, partially offset by the repayment of the principal balance related to our agreement with BMSS of $0.9 million, net of the $0.4 million gain recorded on extinguishment of the BMSS balance.\nAt December 31, 2021, our Mining business operated approximately 30,907 ASIC miners, with a hash rate capacity of 3.1 exahash per second ( EH/s\u201d), utilizing approximately 96 megawatts ( MW\u201d) of capacity. In 2021, we mined 3,812 Bitcoin, which represented an increase of 269% over the 1,033 Bitcoin we mined in 2020. Based on our existing operations and expected deliveries of miners pursuant to our purchase orders with their manufacturer, Bitmain, we anticipate we will have approximately 120,150 miners in operation, utilizing approximately 370 MW of capacity by the end of 2022.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n \nSee Note 3 to our financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our financial statements.\n2022 Trends\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company leases its primary office locations, which expire between 2.5 and seven years, manufacturing facilities of ESS Metron, which expire between 3.5 and 10 years and a ground lease at the Whinstone Facility that expires in December 2030, all of which are inclusive of extension options the Company is reasonably certain will be exercised. At December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any significant operating lease balances.\nCost of revenues for Mining for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $45.5 million and $6.3 million, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $39.2 million. As a percentage of Mining revenue, cost of revenues totaled 24.7% and 52.2% for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cost of revenues consist primarily of direct production costs of mining operations, including electricity, labor, insurance and, in 2020, rent for the Oklahoma City facility and, in 2021, the variable Coinmint hosting fee, but excluding depreciation and amortization which are separately stated. The increase of $39.2 million in cost of revenues is primarily due to the increases in variable mining costs, including the variable hosting fees associated with increases in mining revenues.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offerings\nMining revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled approximately $12.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Other revenue consisted of license payments of approximately $0.1 million in each period. Revenues from cryptocurrency mining are impacted significantly by volatility in Bitcoin prices, as well as increases in the Bitcoin blockchain's network hash rate resulting from the growth in the overall quantity and quality of miners working to solve blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain and the difficulty index associated with the secure hashing algorithm employed in solving the blocks.\n 50 \n* Pursuant to the Company's agreements with Bitmain, the Company is responsible for all shipping charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the miners.\nESS Metron\n 34 \nExpected Term - The expected term of options represents the period that the Company's stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified method, which is the half-life from vesting to the end of its contractual term.\nFunding our operations on a go-forward basis will rely significantly on our ability to mine Bitcoin at a price above our Mining costs and revenue generated from our Hosting and Engineering customers. We expect to generate ongoing revenues from Bitcoin rewards from our Mining operations and our ability to liquidate Bitcoin rewards at future values will be evaluated from time-to-time to generate cash for operations.\n\u00b7 Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract;\nAsset Impairment Charges:\n 32 \nIn May 2020, Whinstone entered into a Power Supply Agreement with TXU Energy Retail Company LLC ( TXU\u201d) to provide the delivery of a fixed amount of electricity by TXU to Whinstone (via the facility owned by Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC ( Oncor\u201d)) for a fixed price through April 30, 2030. The Power Supply Agreement provides a consistent and sufficient supply of electricity at the Whinstone Facility. If Whinstone uses more electricity than contracted, the cost of the excess is incurred at the current spot rate. Concurrently, Whinstone entered into a contract with Oncor for the extension of delivery system transmission/substation facilities to facilitate delivery of the electricity to the Whinstone Facility (the Facilities Agreement\u201d). Power costs incurred under this contract are determined on an hourly basis using settlement information provided by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT\u201d) and are recorded in cost of revenues - data center hosting in our consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment of cryptocurrencies for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $36.5 million and $1.0 million respectively, arising from the decline in Bitcoin prices during the periods.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $87.4 million and $10.3 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of stock-based compensation, legal and professional fees and other personnel and related costs. The increase of $77.2 million is primarily due to an increase in stock-compensation expense of $65.1 million resulting from additional awards (including the performance-based plan announced in August 2021), compensation expense, which increased by $5.7 million due to additional employees to support the Company's growth, and an increase in consulting fees of $2.6 million resulting primarily from assistance on internal control systems and procedures.\nGoodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company determined that it has three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes, Bitcoin Mining, Data Center Hosting, and Electrical Products and Engineering, which is consistent with internal management reporting and management's oversight of operations. Goodwill is not amortized and is reviewed for impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We use both qualitative and quantitative analyses in making this determination. Our analyses require significant assumptions and judgments, including assumptions about future economic conditions, revenue growth, and operating margins, among other factors. Example events or changes in circumstances considered in the qualitative analysis, many of which are subjective in nature, include: a significant negative trend in our industry or overall economic trends, a significant change in how we use the acquired assets, a significant change in or our business strategy, a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, a significant change in regulations or in the industry that could affect the value of the asset, and a change in segments. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs the quantitative test to identify and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered impaired and that excess is recognized as a goodwill impairment loss.\nLevel 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Mining revenue was $184.4 million, and $12.0 million, respectively. The increase of $172.4 million in mining revenue was due to higher Bitcoin values in the 2021 period, averaging $45,744 per coin as compared to $11,461 per coin in the 2020 period, combined with a higher number of Bitcoin mined in 2021, which totaled 3,812, as compared to 1,033 in the 2020 period.\n\u00b7 Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer;\nLevel 3 - assets and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable.\nGlobal supply logistics have caused delays across all channels of distribution. Similarly, we have also experienced delays in certain of our miner delivery schedules. During 2021, we have been able to effectively mitigate any delivery delays to avoid materially impacting our miner deployment schedule, however, there are no assurances we will be able to continue to mitigate any such delivery delays in 2022. Additionally, the scale of the Whinstone expansion requires large quantities of specific materials. We have procured and hold many of the required materials to help mitigate against global supply logistic and pricing concerns. We monitor developments in the global supply chain and how that may potentially impact our expansion plans. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of our Annual Report for additional discussion regarding potential impacts the global supply chain crisis may have on our operations and plans for expansion.\nOperating Activities\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management's best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company entered into purchase agreements with Bitmain for the acquisition of a total of 33,646 of their model S19, S19-Pro, and S19j-Pro Antminer series of miners, to be shipped and delivered during 2020 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received 3,043 model S19 Antminers of these 33,646 new miners, all of which were deployed at the Coinmint Facility. The remaining 30,603 of these new miners were delivered in monthly shipments through January 2022.\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. A committee consisting of the Company's executives is determined to be the CODM. The Company has three operating segments as of December 31, 2021. See Note 18, Segment Information\u201d.\n 44 \nThe demand response services program ( Demand Response Service\u201d) provides the ERCOT market with valuable reliability and economic services by helping to preserve system reliability, enhancing competition, mitigating price spikes, and encouraging the demand side of the market to respond better to wholesale price signals. In collaboration with market participants such as the Company, ERCOT has developed demand response products and services for customers that have the ability to reduce or modify electricity use in response to instructions or signals. Market participants with electrical loads like Whinstone may participate in the Demand Response Service program directly by offering their electrical loads into the ERCOT markets, or indirectly by voluntarily reducing their energy usage in response to increasing wholesale prices.\n 51 \nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOn April 8, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Coinmint (the Coinmint Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Coinmint agreed to provide up to approximately 9.5 MW of electrical power and to perform all maintenance necessary to operate Riot's miners deployed at the Coinmint Facility. In exchange, Coinmint is reimbursed for direct production expenses and receives a performance fee based on the net cryptocurrencies generated by Riot's miners deployed at the Coinmint Facility. The amount of electrical power supplied to Riot's miners at the Coinmint Facility has subsequently been increased to accommodate Riot's expanding miner fleet. However, no formal written amendment to the Coinmint Agreement solidifying Riot's continuing access to sufficient power to operate its expanding fleet of miners has been entered into with Coinmint. The initial term of the Coinmint Agreement was six months, with automatic renewals for subsequent three month terms until terminated as provided in the agreement.\nLegal Proceedings\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to net income, the comparable measure under U.S. GAAP. Further, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to revenue growth, net income, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nATM Offering\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, stock-based compensation and business combinations.\nWe operate in three business segments: (1) Bitcoin Mining ( Mining\u201d), (2) Data Center Hosting ( Hosting\u201d), and (3) Electrical Products and Engineering ( Engineering\u201d).\n 48 \nAcquisition-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $21.2 million and consisted of expenses incurred in connection with our acquisitions of Whinstone and ESS Metron. There were no acquisition-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n 49 \nFor the period from the acquisition of ESS Metron on December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, Engineering revenue was $4.2 million, and there was no Engineering revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Engineering revenue is derived from the sale of custom products built to customers' specifications under fixed-price contracts with one identified performance obligation. Engineering revenues are recognized over time as performance creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and for which the Company has an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract.\nLeases\n\u00b7 Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has been unpredictable and unprecedented and is likely to continue to result in significant national and global economic disruption, which may adversely affect our business. Based on our current assessment, however, we do not expect any material impact on our long-term development, our operations, or our liquidity due to the worldwide spread of COVID-19, other than the potential impacts of COVID-19 on global logistics discussed below. We are actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, and industry.\nElectrical Products and Engineering\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $32.8 million, consisting of proceeds received from the sale of cryptocurrencies of $8.3 million and proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment of $0.1 million, partially offset by deposits on equipment of $33.1 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $8.1 million.\n 43 \nEngineering\nThe Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies the Company has adopted. In order to get a full understanding of the Company's financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed. A summary of the Company's critical accounting policies follows:\nThe Acquisition of ESS Metron provides us with the ability to vertically integrate many of the critical electrical components and engineering services necessary for our Whinstone expansion. A key component of our strategy is to integrate the expertise of the ESS Metron team, which we believe is necessary to reduce our execution and counter-party risk in ongoing and future expansion projects. ESS Metron's engineers will also allow us to continue to explore new methods to optimize and develop a best-in-class Bitcoin mining operation, and they have been instrumental in the development of our industrial-scale immersion-cooled Bitcoin mining hardware. ESS Metron also has an existing electricity distribution product design, manufacture, and installation business primarily focused on large-scale commercial and governmental customers.\nIncome Taxes:\n 33 \n 41 \nChanges in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management's assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts, and therefore, profit and revenue recognition. Any costs to obtain a contract are not material to the Company's financial statements and would be expensed as incurred. Because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change within the near term. The length of time for the Company to complete a custom product varies but is typically between four to 12 weeks.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period-to-period by making such adjustments.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a gain of approximately $1.1 million on the deconsolidation of Tess, due to our reduced ownership interest from 50.2% to 8.8%. No such expense was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nExpected Volatility - The Company computes stock price volatility over expected terms based on its historical common stock trading prices.\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized income of approximately $1.4 million in connection with the reversal of our registration rights penalty.\nData Center Hosting\nThe Company accounts for financial instruments under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820\u201d). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.\nWe have considered recently issued accounting pronouncements and do not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues:\nIn November 2021, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord of certain Whinstone abandoned leases for approximately $0.9 million. After eliminating the associated operating lease liabilities, we recognized other income of approximately $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n 37 \nATM Offering\nExpected Dividend - The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common shares and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in its valuation models.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n 42 \nSubstantially all revenue is derived from the sale of custom products built to customers' specifications under fixed-price contracts with one identified performance obligation. Revenues are recognized over time as performance creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and for which the Company has an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract.\nThe Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company's financial reporting, the Company undertakes a review to determine the consequences of the change to its financial statements and believes that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company's financial statements properly reflect the change.\n \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on the sale / exchange of cryptocurrencies of approximately $5.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019 the gain on sale of cryptocurrencies was $0.7 million.\nOur investment in marketable equity securities consists entirely of common shares of Mogo, Inc. (NASDAQ: MOGO), resulting from the April and May 2021 transactions. (See Note 7, Investments in Marketable Equity Securities\u201d). The Company accounted for this investment in accordance with ASC 321, Investments-Equity Securities, ( ASC 321\u201d) due to the shares having a readily determinable fair value since they are traded on NASDAQ and have significant average daily volume traded. As a result, the investment is required to be measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in other income (expense).\n\nCryptocurrencies (primarily Bitcoin) are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The classification of cryptocurrencies as a current asset has been made after the Company's consideration of the significant consistent daily trading volume on readily available cryptocurrency exchanges, there are no limitations or restrictions on Company's ability to sell Bitcoin and the pattern of actual sales of Bitcoin by the Company. Cryptocurrencies purchased are recorded at cost and cryptocurrencies awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company's revenue recognition policy disclosed below.\n2019 ATM Offering\n\nInvestment in marketable equity securities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income and interest expense was nominal.\nESS Metron is one of the world's leading designers and manufacturers of power distribution equipment. The acquisition of ESS Metron provides critical infrastructure electrical components and engineering expertise to facilitate the expansion of our Whinstone Facility, as well as future strategic growth initiatives we may undertake. ESS Metron has also been instrumental in the design, manufacture, and implementation of our industrial-scale immersion-cooled Bitcoin mining hardware at our Whinstone Facility.\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d). Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right of use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right of use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right of use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\n \nCosts and expenses:\nThe MD&A generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020, as well as year-to-year discussions between 2021, 2020, and 2019, where indicated. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations\u201d in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 31, 2021.\nTotal revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $213.2 million and $12.1 million, respectively, and consisted of our Mining revenue, Hosting revenue, Engineering revenue, and other revenue.\nAs of October 15, 2020, the Company and H.C. Wainwright entered into the first amendment to the Sales Agreement (the First Amendment to the Sales Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the First Amendment to the Sales Agreement, the Company sold, through H.C. Wainwright as its sales agent, $100.0 million in shares of the Company's common stock in an at-the-market offering (the October 2020 ATM Offering\u201d). The Company paid H.C. Wainwright a commission of up to 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds the Company received from all sales of its common stock in the October 2020 ATM Offering.\nWhinstone currently hosts Bitcoin mining operations for institutional-scale mining customers. In addition to Hosting revenue from customers, Whinstone also generates, as part of its Hosting revenue, construction services revenue from hosting customers on site, including revenue derived from the fabrication and deployment of immersion-cooling technology for Bitcoin mining.\n \nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.2 million, consisting of proceeds from the sale of cryptocurrencies of $3.2 million, offset by $5.0 million for the purchase of Bitmain S17-Pro Antminers and deposits on equipment of $1.4 million.\nDuring 2021, we entered into six purchase agreements with Bitmain to acquire 52,500 Antminer model S19j (90 Terahash per second) ( TH/s\u201d) miners and 30,000 of their latest Antminer model S19XP (140 TH/s) miners for a combined total purchase price of approximately $535.0 million. Pursuant to these agreements, approximately $301.3 million remains payable to Bitmain in installments in advance of shipment of the miners, which is scheduled to occur on a monthly basis through December 2022. Of the remaining miners to be delivered, 48,495 new S19j-Pro model miners and 30,000 new S19XP model miners are all scheduled to be delivered throughout the year ended December 31, 2022.\n ",

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": " Here are the key points from the management's discussion and analysis report:\n\n- Riot Blockchain is a Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency infrastructure company. Its main business segments are Bitcoin Mining, Data Center Hosting, and Electrical Products & Engineering. \n\n- In 2021, total revenue was $213.2 million, up significantly from $12.1 million in 2020. The increase was driven by higher Bitcoin prices and more Bitcoin mined.\n\n- Net loss in 2021 was $7.9 million compared to $12.7 million in 2020. The smaller loss was due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\n\n- In 2021, the company acquired Whinstone US and ESS Metron to expand its Bitcoin mining and data center hosting capabilities. It also placed major orders for new Bitcoin miners. \n\n- As of December 2021, Riot had over 30,000 miners deployed with 3.1 EH/s hash rate. It expects to have around 120,000 miners deployed by end of 2022 as new miners are delivered.\n\n- The company raised significant capital in 2021 via at-the-market equity offerings, with over $600 million raised to fund expansion.\n\n- Key financial metrics like mining revenue, hosting revenue, cost of revenues, and SG&A expenses increased substantially in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the company's growth and acquisitions.\n\n- For 2022, Riot expects to continue expanding its Bitcoin mining operations and data center hosting business. Continued Bitcoin miner deployments and acquisitions are key areas of focus."}
