Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included within Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Report that do not relate to present or historical conditions are \u201cforward-looking\nstatements\u201d within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Additional oral or written forward-looking statements may be made by us from time to time, and forward-looking statements may be included in documents that are filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions and are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d or \u201cplans\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Among the important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning the state of the United States economy and the local markets in which our portfolio companies operate, the state of the securities markets in which the securities of our portfolio companies could be traded, liquidity within the United States financial markets, and inflation. Forward-looking statements are also subject to the risks and uncertainties described under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d contained in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report.\nThere may be other factors not identified that affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date when it is made and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and we cannot predict all of them.\nOverview\nWe are an internally managed investment company that lends to and invests in small companies often concurrently with other investors. We have elected to be treated as a business development company (\u201cBDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d). As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We have historically made the majority of our investments through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Rand Capital SBIC, Inc. (\u201cRand SBIC\u201d), which operates as a small business investment company (\u201cSBIC\u201d) and has been licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) since 2002. During 2017, we established a second SBIC subsidiary, Rand Capital SBIC II, L.P. (Rand SBIC II) and began making investments from this SBIC subsidiary. We continue to work with the SBA in determining an optimal structure within its regulatory parameters which, once completed, may result in new SBA leverage commitments in 2018.\nOur principal investment objective is to achieve long-term capital appreciation on our equity investments while maintaining a current cash flow from our debenture and pass-through equity instruments to fund our operating expenses. Therefore, we invest in a variety of financial instruments to provide a current return on a portion of the investment portfolio. The equity features contained in our investment portfolio are structured to realize capital appreciation over the long-term and typically do not generate current income in the form of dividends or interest.\nWe have historically made initial investments of $500,000 to $1,000,000 directly in companies through equity or in debt or loan instruments and frequently provided follow-on investments during our investment tenure. The debt instruments generally have a maturity of not more than five years and usually have detachable equity warrants. Interest may be paid currently or deferred, based on the investment structure negotiated.\nWe may exit investments through the maturation of a debt security or when a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale, recapitalization, or initial public offering of a portfolio company. The method and timing of the disposition of our portfolio investments can be critical to the realization of maximum total return. We generally expect to dispose of our equity securities through private sales of securities to other investors or through an outright sale of the portfolio company or a merger. We anticipate our debt investments will be repaid with interest and hope to realize further appreciation from the warrants or other equity type instruments we receive in connection with the investment. We fund new investments and operating expenses through existing cash balances, investment returns, and interest and principal payments from our portfolio companies\n2017 Portfolio and Investment Activity\nWe believe the change in net asset value over time is the leading valuation metric of our performance. Exits from our portfolio holdings are the key driver of growth in net asset value over time.\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Net asset value of our portfolio decreased to $5.05 per share, or $31.9 million, at December 31, 2017, down ($0.11) per share, or (2.1%), compared with net asset value of $5.16 per share, or $32.6 million, at the end of the prior year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> At year end, the estimated value of our portfolio, which included securities from 30 active companies, was $32.3 million. This value included $4.4 million in net pre-tax unrealized depreciation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Approximately 58% of the portfolio was equity investments with the remainder being debt and loan investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> The portfolio generated approximately $1.5 million in interest, fee, dividend and other income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> During 2017, we made $5.4 million of new investments in 8 companies, of which one was a new portfolio company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutlook\nAt the end of 2017, we had $6.3 million in cash available for future investments and expenses, a decrease from $12.3 million at the end of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to $5.4 million of investments originated during 2017 as well as funding of ongoing operating expenses.\nWe continue to work with the SBA in determining an optimal structure within its regulatory parameters which, once completed, may result in new SBA leverage commitments in 2018.\nWe believe the combination of cash on hand, proceeds from portfolio exits, potential additional SBA leverage, and prospective investment income provide sufficient capital for us to continue to add new investments to our portfolio while reinvesting in existing portfolio companies that demonstrate continued growth potential. The following short and long-term trends provide us confidence in our ability to grow Rand:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> We expect that well run businesses will require capital to grow and should be able to compete effectively given the strong macroeconomic environment and eager reception of new technologies and service concepts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> We continue to manage risk by investing with other investors, when possible.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> We are actively involved with the governance and management of our portfolio companies, which enables us to support their operating and marketing efforts and facilitate their growth.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> As our portfolio expands, we are able to better leverage our infrastructure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> We have sufficient cash to invest in new opportunities and to repurchase shares. At year end, we had authorization to repurchase an additional 458,954 shares of our Common Stock. However, our prioritized use of cash continues to be growing our portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Critical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. For a summary of all significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nThe increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require us to closely monitor our accounting policies and procedures. We have two critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgment. The following summary of critical accounting policies is intended to enhance a reader's ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates.\nValuation of Investments\nInvestments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by management and approved by our Board of Directors. We invest in loan, debt, and equity instruments and there is no single standard for determining fair value of these investments. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistent valuation process. We analyze and value each investment quarterly, and record unrealized depreciation for an investment that we believe has become impaired, including where collection of a loan or realization of the recorded value of an equity security is doubtful. Conversely, we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that an underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and, therefore, its equity security has also appreciated in value. These estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events.\nOur investments are carried at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nLoan investments are defined as traditional loan financings with no equity features. Debt investments are defined as debt financings that include one or more equity features such as conversion rights, stock purchase warrants, and/or stock purchase options. A financing may also be categorized as a debt financing if it is accompanied by the direct purchase of an equity interest in the company.\nWe utilize several approaches to determine the fair value of an investment. The main approaches are:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Loan and debt securities are valued at cost when it is representative of the fair value of the investment or sufficient assets or liquidation proceeds are expected to exist from a sale of a portfolio company at its estimated fair value. However, they may be valued at an amount other than cost given the carrying interest rate versus the related inherent portfolio risk of the investment. A loan or debt instrument may be reduced in value if it is judged to be of poor quality, collection is in doubt or insufficient liquidation proceeds exist.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Equity securities may be valued using the \u201casset approach\u201d, \u201cmarket approach\u201d or \u201cincome approach.\u201d The asset approach involves estimating the liquidation value of the portfolio company's assets. To the extent the value exceeds the remaining principal amount of the debt or loan securities of the portfolio company, the fair value of such securities is generally estimated to be their cost. However, where value is less than the remaining principal amount of the loan and debt securities, the Corporation may discount the value of an equity security. The market approach uses observable prices and other relevant information generated by similar market transactions. It may include the use of market multiples derived from a set of comparables to assist in pricing the investment. Additionally, the Corporation adjusts valuations if a subsequent significant equity financing has occurred that includes a meaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated, unrelated new investor. The income approach employs a cash flow and discounting methodology to value an investment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, used in our valuation at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\nLevel 3: Unobservable and significant inputs to determining the fair value.\nFinancial assets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.\nAny changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the statement of operations as \u201cNet (decrease) increase in unrealized depreciation or appreciation on investments.\u201d\nUnder the valuation policy, we value unrestricted publicly traded companies, categorized as Level 1 investments, at the average closing bid price for the last three trading days of the reporting period. There were no Level 1 or Level 2 investments as of December 31, 2017.\nIn the valuation process, we value restricted securities, categorized as Level 3 investments, using information from these portfolio companies, which may include:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Audited and unaudited statements of operations, balance sheets and operating budgets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Current and projected financial, operational and technological developments of the portfolio company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Current and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> The current capital structure of the business and the seniority of the various classes of equity if a deemed liquidation event were to occur;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Pending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Current information regarding any offers to purchase the investment, or recent fundraising transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Current ability of the portfolio company to raise additional financing if needed;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Changes in the economic environment which may have a material impact on the operating results of the portfolio company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Internal circumstances and events that may have an impact (both positive and negative) on the operating performance of the portfolio company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Qualitative assessment of key management;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Contractual rights, obligations or restrictions associated with the investment; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Other factors deemed relevant by our management to assess valuation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe valuation may be reduced if a portfolio company's performance and potential have deteriorated significantly. If the factors that led to a reduction in valuation are overcome, the valuation may be readjusted.\nEquity Securities\nEquity Securities may include preferred stock, common stock, warrants and limited liability company membership interests.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our equity investments are earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and revenue multiples, where applicable, the financial and operational performance of the business, and the senior equity preferences that may exist in a deemed liquidation event. Standard industry multiples may be used when available; however, our portfolio companies are typically small and in early stages of development and these industry standards may be adjusted to more closely match the specific financial and operational performance of the portfolio company. Due to the nature of certain investments, fair value measurements may be based on other criteria, which may include third party appraisals. Significant changes to the unobservable inputs, such as variances in financial performance from expectations, may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.\nAnother key factor used in valuing equity investments is a significant recent arms-length equity transaction with a sophisticated non-strategic unrelated new investor entered into by the portfolio company. The terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and us, and the impact of the difference in transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify.\nWhen appropriate the Black-Scholes pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of warrants for accounting purposes. This model requires the use of highly subjective inputs including expected volatility and expected life, in addition to variables for the valuation of minority equity positions in small private and early stage companies. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.\nFor recent investments, we generally rely on the cost basis, which is deemed to represent fair value, unless other fair market value inputs are identified causing us to depart from this basis.\nLoans and Debt Securities\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our loan and debt securities are the financial and operational performance of the portfolio company, similar debt with similar terms with other portfolio companies, current market rates for underlying risks associated with the particular company, as well as the market acceptance of the portfolio company's products or services and its future performance. These inputs will likely provide an indicator as to the probability of principal recovery of the investment. Our debt investments are often junior secured or unsecured debt securities. Fair value may also be determined based on other criteria where appropriate. Significant changes to the unobservable inputs may result in a change in fair value. For recent investments, we generally rely on the cost basis, which is deemed to represent the fair value, unless other fair market value inputs are identified causing us to depart from this basis.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest income generally is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt. In such cases, interest income is recognized at the time of receipt. A reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate.\nOur SBIC's interest accrual is also regulated by the SBA's \u201cAccounting Standards and Financial Reporting Requirements for Small Business Investment Companies.\u201d Under these rules, interest income cannot be recognized if collection is doubtful, and a 100% reserve must be established. The collection of interest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company's ability to continue as a going concern or the loan is in default more than 120 days. Management also uses other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest.\nWe hold debt securities in our investment portfolio that contain payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest provisions. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment.\nWe may receive distributions from portfolio companies that are limited liability companies or corporations. These distributions are classified as dividend income on the consolidated statement of operations. Dividend income is recognized on an accrual basis when it can be reasonably estimated.\nWe hold preferred equity securities that may contain cumulative dividend provisions. Cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income when they are declared and deemed a contractual obligation. Any dividends in arrears are added to the balance of the preferred equity investment. The actual collection of these dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed.\nFinancial Condition\nOverview:\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12/31/17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12/31/16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Decrease </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,133,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,418,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>2,284,617 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.4 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,215,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,789,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,573,939 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.1 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,918,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,629,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>710,678 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net asset value was $5.05 per share at December 31, 2017 versus $5.16 per share at December 31, 2016.\nThe outstanding SBA debentures at December 31, 2017 are $8,000,000, which will mature from 2022 through 2025.\nCash approximated 20% of net assets at December 31, 2017 compared to 38% at December 31, 2016.\nComposition of the Investment Portfolio\nOur financial condition is dependent on the success of our portfolio holdings, which are investments in small companies.

There were no amounts earned pursuant to the Profit Sharing Plan for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Increase </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,401,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,817,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,583,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in operating expenses during 2016 was comprised primarily of a $1,262,552 increase in bonus and profit sharing expense, due to the Gemcor sale in 2016, and a $137,629 increase in professional fees.\nOur largest portfolio company, in terms of fair value, Gemcor II, LLC (Gemcor) sold its assets during March 2016 and, based on our ownership percentage, we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million. The realized gain from the sale, before income taxes, was $14,620,063 and included $1,100,000 that continued to be held in escrow at December 31, 2016. The escrow holdback is recorded in \u201cOther Assets\u201d on the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position. The escrow was released during 2017. Related to this asset sale, we accrued $1,270,052 under our Profit Sharing Plan for the year ended December 31, 2016, that is payable to our executive officers. Recording of the profit sharing expense is primarily based on net realized gains, which may be in years subsequent to when the unrealized appreciation is recognized on the underlying investments in the financial statements. This may cause a recognition of profit sharing expense in a period later than when the appreciation is recognized, as was the case in 2016. There were no amounts earned pursuant to the Profit Sharing Plan for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProfessional fees were also higher during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 2015 because we incurred additional expenses in connection with developing and implementing our long-term growth strategy. These expenses included external legal, tax consulting and other advisory expenses to support refinement of our strategy, which involved assessing options relative to the complex regulatory environment in which we operate.\nNet Realized Gains and Losses on Investments\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gain (loss) on sales and dispositions, before income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,138,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>42,469 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table> During the year ended December 31, 2017, one of our portfolio companies, Athenex Inc.

Based on our ownership of Gemcor, we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million at closing, before considering the $1.1 million held in escrow. Additionally, we incurred the related profit sharing expense in the first quarter of 2016. We valued our investment in Gemcor at December 31, 2015 based on an EBITDA multiple which approximated our sales proceeds.\nIn accordance with our valuation policy, we increased the value of our holdings in Athenex and Social Flow based on significant equity financings for each during 2015 with sophisticated new non-strategic outside investors at a higher valuation for each than their prior financing round valuation.\nThe Crowdbouncer investment was written off after the company ceased doing business during 2015.\nWe sold our remaining shares of Synacor during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Oncore, Givegab, Mercantile and Knowledge Vision investment values were decreased after we reviewed each of the portfolio company's commercial progress against their business plans and their past financial performance.

We also considered in our review the past financial performance of the companies, their forecasted cash needs, and their fundraising plans for 2016 in determining that reductions in values were appropriate. If the factors which led to the reductions in valuations are overcome, the valuations may be restored.\nThe valuation of Sciaps was decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015 to revalue our equity holdings based upon liquidation preferences of our securities and on the most recent equity round of financing.\nAll of these value adjustments resulted from a review by management using the guidance set forth by ASC 820 and our established valuation policy.\nNet (Decrease) Increase in Net Assets from Operations\nWe account for our operations under GAAP for investment companies. The principal measure of our financial performance is \u201cnet (decrease) increase in net assets from operations\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the net decrease in net assets from operations was ($710,678) as compared with net decrease of ($1,202,683) in 2016 and a net increase of $1,500,219 in 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal objective is to achieve capital appreciation. Therefore, a significant portion of the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the potential for capital appreciation and may provide little or no current yield in the form of dividends or interest payments.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our total liquidity consisted of $6,262,039 in cash.\nNet cash used by operating activities has averaged approximately $2,314,000 over the last three years. The average cash used for investments in portfolio companies has averaged approximately $6,084,000 over the last three years. Our cash flow may fluctuate based on the timing of the receipt of dividend income, realized exits and the associated income taxes paid. We will generally use cash to fund our operating expenses and to invest in companies as we build our portfolio. We anticipate that we will continue to exit investments. However, the timing of liquidation events within the portfolio is difficult to project. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any outstanding commitments to borrow funds from the SBA. Starting in 2022 (See Footnote 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) our outstanding SBA debt begins to reach maturity and this will require us to identify sources of future funding if liquidation of investments is not sufficient to fund operations and repay the SBA debt obligation.\nDuring 2017, we established a second SBIC subsidiary, Rand Capital SBIC II, L.P. (Rand SBIC II) and began making investments from this SBIC subsidiary. We continue to work with the SBA in determining an optimal structure within the SBA's regulatory parameters which, once completed, may result in new SBA leverage commitments in 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the SBA leverage at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12/31/17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12/31/16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outstanding SBA leverage\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,000,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outstanding SBA commitment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the cash estimated to be received over the next five years from existing portfolio companies based on contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017. This table does not include any escrow receivable amounts. These payments represent scheduled principal and interest payments that are due under the terms of the investment securities we own in each portfolio company and are subject to change based on factors such as conversions and restructurings. It does not include any equity investments, which may provide additional proceeds upon exit of the investment.\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash Receipts due by year </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 and\nbeyond </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Scheduled cash receipts from portfolio companies\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,430,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,123,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,671,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,370,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,719,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> We believe that the cash on hand at December 31, 2017 and the scheduled interest payments on our portfolio investments will be sufficient to meet our cash needs throughout 2018. We continue to pursue potential exits from portfolio companies to increase the amount of liquidity available for new investments, operating activities and future SBA debenture obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table shows our specified contractual obligations at December 31, 2017.

The average cash used for investments in portfolio companies has averaged approximately $6,084,000 over the last three years. Our cash flow may fluctuate based on the timing of the receipt of dividend income, realized exits and the associated income taxes paid. We will generally use cash to fund our operating expenses and to invest in companies as we build our portfolio. We anticipate that we will continue to exit investments. However, the timing of liquidation events within the portfolio is difficult to project. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any outstanding commitments to borrow funds from the SBA. Starting in 2022 (See Footnote 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) our outstanding SBA debt begins to reach maturity and this will require us to identify sources of future funding if liquidation of investments is not sufficient to fund operations and repay the SBA debt obligation.\nFees paid for board service at the portfolio companies were $1,000 and $4,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carolina Skiff LLC (Carolina Skiff)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,052 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New Monarch Machine Tool, LLC (Monarch)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,409 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tilson Technology Management, Inc.

The decrease was primarily due to $5.4 million of investments originated during 2017 as well as funding of ongoing operating expenses.\nOur principal investment objective is to achieve long-term capital appreciation on our equity investments while maintaining a current cash flow from our debenture and pass-through equity instruments to fund our operating expenses. Therefore, we invest in a variety of financial instruments to provide a current return on a portion of the investment portfolio. The equity features contained in our investment portfolio are structured to realize capital appreciation over the long-term and typically do not generate current income in the form of dividends or interest.\nThe change in net unrealized depreciation of investments, before income taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was comprised of the following:\nThe following table summarizes the SBA leverage at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nNet Realized Gains and Losses on Investments\n \u2022 Changes in the economic environment which may have a material impact on the operating results of the portfolio company; \nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included within Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n Fee income - Fee income consists of the revenue associated with the amortization of financing fees charged to the portfolio companies upon successful closing of SBIC financings and income from portfolio company board attendance fees. The financing fees are amortized ratably over the life of the instrument associated with the fees. The unamortized fees are carried on the balance sheet under the line item \u201cDeferred revenue.\u201d\nThere may be other factors not identified that affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date when it is made and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and we cannot predict all of them.\nWe believe the change in net asset value over time is the leading valuation metric of our performance. Exits from our portfolio holdings are the key driver of growth in net asset value over time.\nDividend and other investment income - Dividend and other investment income decreased in 2016 due to the asset sale of Gemcor II, LLC in March 2016. The dividend distributions for the respective years were:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a net realized gain, before income taxes, of $262,925 on the sale of 301,582 shares of Synacor, Inc. (Synacor). Synacor trades on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \u201cSYNC\u201d. As of December 31, 2015, we did not own any shares of Synacor.\nDuring 2017, we established a second SBIC subsidiary, Rand Capital SBIC II, L.P. (Rand SBIC II) and began making investments from this SBIC subsidiary. We continue to work with the SBA in determining an optimal structure within the SBA's regulatory parameters which, once completed, may result in new SBA leverage commitments in 2018.\nInterest from other investments - The decrease in interest from other investments was primarily due to lower average cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2017 versus the year ended December 31, 2016.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nUnder the valuation policy, we value unrestricted publicly traded companies, categorized as Level 1 investments, at the average closing bid price for the last three trading days of the reporting period. There were no Level 1 or Level 2 investments as of December 31, 2017.\nOur SBIC's interest accrual is also regulated by the SBA's \u201cAccounting Standards and Financial Reporting Requirements for Small Business Investment Companies.\u201d Under these rules, interest income cannot be recognized if collection is doubtful, and a 100% reserve must be established. The collection of interest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company's ability to continue as a going concern or the loan is in default more than 120 days. Management also uses other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest.\nIntrinsiq's value was increased based on a the completion of an equity refinancing in the third quarter of 2016.\nCash approximated 20% of net assets at December 31, 2017 compared to 38% at December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 At year end, the estimated value of our portfolio, which included securities from 30 active companies, was $32.3 million. This value included $4.4 million in net pre-tax unrealized depreciation. \nWe realized a loss of $650,000 on our investment in Statisfy, Inc. (Statisfy) during the year ended December 31, 2016 when the company ceased operations.\nIn accordance with our valuation policy, we increased the value of our holdings in Athenex and Social Flow based on significant equity financings for each during 2015 with sophisticated new non-strategic outside investors at a higher valuation for each than their prior financing round valuation.\nThe Oncore, Givegab, Mercantile and Knowledge Vision investment values were decreased after we reviewed each of the portfolio company's commercial progress against their business plans and their past financial performance. These reviews indicated that deterioration of their respective businesses had occurred. If the factors which led to these reductions in valuations are overcome, the valuations may be restored.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n2017 Portfolio and Investment Activity\nThe following table shows our specified contractual obligations at December 31, 2017. We do not have any capital lease obligations or other long-term liabilities reflected on our statement of financial position.\n \u2022 Current and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations; \n\nFees paid for board service at the portfolio companies were $4,000 and $11,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAnother key factor used in valuing equity investments is a significant recent arms-length equity transaction with a sophisticated non-strategic unrelated new investor entered into by the portfolio company. The terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and us, and the impact of the difference in transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify.\n \u2022 Approximately 58% of the portfolio was equity investments with the remainder being debt and loan investments. \n\nThe valuation of our investment in Oncore was decreased after we reviewed the portfolio company and its financial condition and determined that a valuation adjustment was necessary.\nThe change in net unrealized appreciation of investments, before income taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was comprised of the following:\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n\nNet (Decrease) Increase in Unrealized Depreciation or Appreciation of Investments\nThe increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require us to closely monitor our accounting policies and procedures. We have two critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgment. The following summary of critical accounting policies is intended to enhance a reader's ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates.\nThe following table summarizes the cash estimated to be received over the next five years from existing portfolio companies based on contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017. This table does not include any escrow receivable amounts. These payments represent scheduled principal and interest payments that are due under the terms of the investment securities we own in each portfolio company and are subject to change based on factors such as conversions and restructurings. It does not include any equity investments, which may provide additional proceeds upon exit of the investment.\nFinancial assets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.\n In December 2015 we entered into an asset purchase agreement under which we agreed to sell Gemcor. The required percentage of Gemcor shareholders ratified and approved the sale in January 2016. The transaction closed in the first quarter of 2016. Based on our ownership of Gemcor, we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million at closing, before considering the $1.1 million held in escrow. Additionally, we incurred the related profit sharing expense in the first quarter of 2016. We valued our investment in Gemcor at December 31, 2015 based on an EBITDA multiple which approximated our sales proceeds.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our equity investments are earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and revenue multiples, where applicable, the financial and operational performance of the business, and the senior equity preferences that may exist in a deemed liquidation event. Standard industry multiples may be used when available; however, our portfolio companies are typically small and in early stages of development and these industry standards may be adjusted to more closely match the specific financial and operational performance of the portfolio company. Due to the nature of certain investments, fair value measurements may be based on other criteria, which may include third party appraisals. Significant changes to the unobservable inputs, such as variances in financial performance from expectations, may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.\n Fee income - The income associated with the amortization of financing fees was $22,634 and $18,333 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The financing fee income based on the existing portfolio is expected to be approximately $20,000 in 2017, $15,000 in 2018, $11,000 in 2019 and $300 in 2020.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. For a summary of all significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nOur investment in Teleservices was revalued after we reviewed their operations and their current and past financial performance. This review indicated that a further deterioration of their business had occurred. If the factors that led to this reduction in valuation are overcome, the value may be restored. The portfolio company remains in operation and is developing new business strategies.\n \u2022 We are actively involved with the governance and management of our portfolio companies, which enables us to support their operating and marketing efforts and facilitate their growth. \nValuation of Investments\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nOur principal objective is to achieve capital appreciation. Therefore, a significant portion of the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the potential for capital appreciation and may provide little or no current yield in the form of dividends or interest payments.\nstatements\u201d within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Additional oral or written forward-looking statements may be made by us from time to time, and forward-looking statements may be included in documents that are filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions and are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d or \u201cplans\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Among the important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning the state of the United States economy and the local markets in which our portfolio companies operate, the state of the securities markets in which the securities of our portfolio companies could be traded, liquidity within the United States financial markets, and inflation. Forward-looking statements are also subject to the risks and uncertainties described under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d contained in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report.\nOur principal investment objective is to achieve long-term capital appreciation on our equity investments while maintaining a current cash flow from our debenture and pass-through equity instruments to fund expenses. Therefore, we invest in a variety of financial instruments to provide a current return on a portion of the investment portfolio.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 Equity securities may be valued using the \u201casset approach\u201d, \u201cmarket approach\u201d or \u201cincome approach.\u201d The asset approach involves estimating the liquidation value of the portfolio company's assets. To the extent the value exceeds the remaining principal amount of the debt or loan securities of the portfolio company, the fair value of such securities is generally estimated to be their cost. However, where value is less than the remaining principal amount of the loan and debt securities, the Corporation may discount the value of an equity security. The market approach uses observable prices and other relevant information generated by similar market transactions. It may include the use of market multiples derived from a set of comparables to assist in pricing the investment. Additionally, the Corporation adjusts valuations if a subsequent significant equity financing has occurred that includes a meaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated, unrelated new investor. The income approach employs a cash flow and discounting methodology to value an investment.  ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:\n The valuations of our investments in Intrinsiq, Mercantile and Teleservices were decreased after we reviewed each portfolio company and its current and projected financial condition and determined that a valuation adjustment was necessary.\n \u2022 Internal circumstances and events that may have an impact (both positive and negative) on the operating performance of the portfolio company; \nAny changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the statement of operations as \u201cNet (decrease) increase in unrealized depreciation or appreciation on investments.\u201d\n Investment income decreased 64%, or $1,792,479, from $2,824,337 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1,031,858 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in dividend income caused by the sale of a large dividend producing investment, Gemcor, II, LLC (Gemcor) during 2016.\nOur investments are carried at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nInvestments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by management and approved by our Board of Directors. We invest in loan, debt, and equity instruments and there is no single standard for determining fair value of these investments. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistent valuation process. We analyze and value each investment quarterly, and record unrealized depreciation for an investment that we believe has become impaired, including where collection of a loan or realization of the recorded value of an equity security is doubtful. Conversely, we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that an underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and, therefore, its equity security has also appreciated in value. These estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events.\nThe change in net unrealized depreciation of investments, before income taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was comprised of the following:\nProfessional fees were also higher during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 2015 because we incurred additional expenses in connection with developing and implementing our long-term growth strategy. These expenses included external legal, tax consulting and other advisory expenses to support refinement of our strategy, which involved assessing options relative to the complex regulatory environment in which we operate.\n Our total investments at fair value, as estimated by management and approved by the Board of Directors, approximated 101% of net assets at December 31, 2017 and 84% of net assets at December 31, 2016.\nThe valuation of Sciaps was decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015 to revalue our equity holdings based upon liquidation preferences of our securities and on the most recent equity round of financing.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe First Wave, Intrinsiq, and Teleservices investment values were decreased during 2015 after we reviewed each of the portfolio company's progress toward commercialization and broad based acceptance of their respective business technologies and services in their respective markets. We also considered in our review the past financial performance of the companies, their forecasted cash needs, and their fundraising plans for 2016 in determining that reductions in values were appropriate. If the factors which led to the reductions in valuations are overcome, the valuations may be restored.\n During the first quarter of 2016 Gemcor II, LLC sold its assets and we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million. The realized gain from the sale, before income taxes, was $14,620,063 and included $1,100,000 that was held in escrow at December 31, 2016 and recorded on the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position in \u201cOther Assets.\u201d\n Operating expenses consist predominately of compensation expense, including profit sharing, and related benefits, interest expense on outstanding SBA borrowings, and general and administrative expenses including shareholder and office expenses and professional fees.\n \u2022 We expect that well run businesses will require capital to grow and should be able to compete effectively given the strong macroeconomic environment and eager reception of new technologies and service concepts. \nThe change in investments, at cost, during the year ended December 31, 2017, is comprised of the following:\nOur top five portfolio companies represented 37% of total assets at December 31, 2017:\nWe have historically made initial investments of $500,000 to $1,000,000 directly in companies through equity or in debt or loan instruments and frequently provided follow-on investments during our investment tenure. The debt instruments generally have a maturity of not more than five years and usually have detachable equity warrants. Interest may be paid currently or deferred, based on the investment structure negotiated.\n \u2022 Audited and unaudited statements of operations, balance sheets and operating budgets; \nThe following investments remain on non-accrual status: G-TEC Natural Gas Systems (G-Tec), First Wave Products Group, LLC (First Wave) and a portion of the Mercantile Adjustment Bureau, LLC (Mercantile) outstanding loan balance.\nInterest income generally is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt. In such cases, interest income is recognized at the time of receipt. A reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate.\nInterest from portfolio companies - Our portfolio interest income increased during 2016 due to the addition of several large debt instruments in late 2015 and throughout 2016. The new debt instruments were originated from Genicon Inc. (Genicon), eHealth Global Technologies, Inc. (eHealth), Empire Genomics, LLC (Empire Genomics), SciAps, Inc. (Sciaps) and several other portfolio companies.\nWe account for our operations under GAAP for investment companies. The principal measure of our financial performance is \u201cnet (decrease) increase in net assets from operations\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the net decrease in net assets from operations was ($710,678) as compared with net decrease of ($1,202,683) in 2016 and a net increase of $1,500,219 in 2015.\nExpenses\n \u2022 Current information regarding any offers to purchase the investment, or recent fundraising transactions; \nStatements included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Report that do not relate to present or historical conditions are \u201cforward-looking\nFinancial Condition\nInterest from other investments - The increase in interest from other investments was primarily due to higher average cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLoans and Debt Securities\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the investment portfolio consisted of the following types of investments:\nDividend and other investment income - Dividend income is comprised of cash distributions from limited liability companies (LLCs) and corporations in which we have invested. Our investment agreements with certain LLCs require those LLCs to distribute funds to us for payment of income taxes on our allocable share of the LLC's profits. These portfolio companies may also elect to make additional discretionary distributions. Dividend income will fluctuate based upon the profitability of these LLCs and corporations and the timing of the distributions or the impact of new investments or divestitures. The dividend distributions for the respective periods were:\n \u2022 Current ability of the portfolio company to raise additional financing if needed; \nThe valuation of our investment in Knoa was decreased during 2016 to value our equity at liquidation value.\n \u2022 We have sufficient cash to invest in new opportunities and to repurchase shares. At year end, we had authorization to repurchase an additional 458,954 shares of our Common Stock. However, our prioritized use of cash continues to be growing our portfolio.  Critical Accounting Policies\nThe decrease in expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 versus the same period in 2016 was primarily caused by a decrease of $1,373,052 in bonus and profit sharing expense related to the Gemcor II, LLC (Gemcor) exit in early 2016. Gemcor sold its assets in March 2016 and based on our ownership percentage, we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $13.8 million, excluding an escrow receivable, and realized a gain, before income taxes, of approximately $13.2 million from the sale. As a result of this sale, we recognized $1,385,052 under our Profit Sharing Plan during the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no amounts earned pursuant to the Profit Sharing Plan for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 Current and projected financial, operational and technological developments of the portfolio company; \nRevenue Recognition\nWe may exit investments through the maturation of a debt security or when a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale, recapitalization, or initial public offering of a portfolio company. The method and timing of the disposition of our portfolio investments can be critical to the realization of maximum total return. We generally expect to dispose of our equity securities through private sales of securities to other investors or through an outright sale of the portfolio company or a merger. We anticipate our debt investments will be repaid with interest and hope to realize further appreciation from the warrants or other equity type instruments we receive in connection with the investment. We fund new investments and operating expenses through existing cash balances, investment returns, and interest and principal payments from our portfolio companies\nEquity Securities may include preferred stock, common stock, warrants and limited liability company membership interests.\nWhen appropriate the Black-Scholes pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of warrants for accounting purposes. This model requires the use of highly subjective inputs including expected volatility and expected life, in addition to variables for the valuation of minority equity positions in small private and early stage companies. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.\nWe believe the combination of cash on hand, proceeds from portfolio exits, potential additional SBA leverage, and prospective investment income provide sufficient capital for us to continue to add new investments to our portfolio while reinvesting in existing portfolio companies that demonstrate continued growth potential. The following short and long-term trends provide us confidence in our ability to grow Rand:\nLevel 3: Unobservable and significant inputs to determining the fair value.\n Below is the geographic breakdown of our investments at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThe income associated with the amortization of financing fees was $24,091 and $22,634 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The financing fee income based on the existing portfolio is expected to be approximately $21,000 in 2018, $15,000 in 2019 and $2,000 in 2020.\nOutlook\nThe Somerset investment value was decreased during 2015 after a review of the company's financial performance and the overall weakness in the oil and gas sector.\nWe hold preferred equity securities that may contain cumulative dividend provisions. Cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income when they are declared and deemed a contractual obligation. Any dividends in arrears are added to the balance of the preferred equity investment. The actual collection of these dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed.\nComposition of the Investment Portfolio\n \u2022 The current capital structure of the business and the seniority of the various classes of equity if a deemed liquidation event were to occur; \nIn accordance with our valuation policy, we adjusted the value of our investments in ACV, Beetnpath and Sciaps based on a significant equity financing by a new non-strategic outside entity, and consideration of the related affect on the liquidation preferences of our existing investment instrument in each of the companies. In addition, our investments in Carolina Skiff and Knoa were increased based on a financial analysis of each portfolio company indicating improved performance.\nWe are an internally managed investment company that lends to and invests in small companies often concurrently with other investors. We have elected to be treated as a business development company (\u201cBDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d). As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We have historically made the majority of our investments through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Rand Capital SBIC, Inc. (\u201cRand SBIC\u201d), which operates as a small business investment company (\u201cSBIC\u201d) and has been licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) since 2002. During 2017, we established a second SBIC subsidiary, Rand Capital SBIC II, L.P. (Rand SBIC II) and began making investments from this SBIC subsidiary. We continue to work with the SBA in determining an optimal structure within its regulatory parameters which, once completed, may result in new SBA leverage commitments in 2018.\nIn addition, we recorded a realized gain of $168,140 during the year ended December 31, 2016 from the earn out provision in connection with the 2014 sale of QuaDPharma, LLC to Athenex Inc.\nInvestment Income\n \u2022 Pending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company; \nOur largest portfolio company, in terms of fair value, Gemcor II, LLC (Gemcor) sold its assets during March 2016 and, based on our ownership percentage, we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million. The realized gain from the sale, before income taxes, was $14,620,063 and included $1,100,000 that continued to be held in escrow at December 31, 2016. The escrow holdback is recorded in \u201cOther Assets\u201d on the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position. The escrow was released during 2017. Related to this asset sale, we accrued $1,270,052 under our Profit Sharing Plan for the year ended December 31, 2016, that is payable to our executive officers. Recording of the profit sharing expense is primarily based on net realized gains, which may be in years subsequent to when the unrealized appreciation is recognized on the underlying investments in the financial statements. This may cause a recognition of profit sharing expense in a period later than when the appreciation is recognized, as was the case in 2016. There were no amounts earned pursuant to the Profit Sharing Plan for the year ended December 31, 2015.", "item_7_text": "Overview\nNet (Decrease) Increase in Net Assets from Operations\nDuring the first quarter of 2016 our portfolio company, Gemcor II, LLC, sold its assets, and accordingly, we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, excluding amounts held in escrow, and recognized a realized gain, before income taxes, of $14,620,063. The escrow holdback at December 31, 2016 was $1,100,000 and is recorded in \u201cOther Assets\u201d on the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position. The escrow was released during 2017.\n We believe that the cash on hand at December 31, 2017 and the scheduled interest payments on our portfolio investments will be sufficient to meet our cash needs throughout 2018. We continue to pursue potential exits from portfolio companies to increase the amount of liquidity available for new investments, operating activities and future SBA debenture obligations.\n \u2022 We continue to manage risk by investing with other investors, when possible. \nIn accordance with our valuation policy, we increased the value of our investment in Athenex based on a significant equity financing by a new non-strategic outside entity. This new financing used a higher valuation for Athenex than had been used for its prior financing rounds.\n \u2022 Contractual rights, obligations or restrictions associated with the investment; and \nFor recent investments, we generally rely on the cost basis, which is deemed to represent fair value, unless other fair market value inputs are identified causing us to depart from this basis.\nThe following investments remain on non-accrual status: G-TEC Natural Gas Systems (G-Tec), First Wave Products Group, LLC (First Wave) and a portion of the Mercantile Adjustment Bureau, LLC (Mercantile) outstanding loan balance.\nIn addition, during 2017, we realized a loss of $500,000 on our investment in City Dining Cards (Loupe) when the company ceased operations.\nWe utilize several approaches to determine the fair value of an investment. The main approaches are:\nWe sold our remaining shares of Synacor during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe increase in operating expenses during 2016 was comprised primarily of a $1,262,552 increase in bonus and profit sharing expense, due to the Gemcor sale in 2016, and a $137,629 increase in professional fees.\n \u2022 As our portfolio expands, we are able to better leverage our infrastructure. \n \u2022 During 2017, we made $5.4 million of new investments in 8 companies, of which one was a new portfolio company. \nWe recognized a realized loss of $5,394 on an adjustment to the BinOptics Corporation (Binoptics) escrow receivable. At December 31, 2015, the Binoptics escrow receivable was $1,504,854 and was received during 2016.\n Investment income increased 41%, or $422,924, from $1,031,858 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $1,454,782 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe valuation may be reduced if a portfolio company's performance and potential have deteriorated significantly. If the factors that led to a reduction in valuation are overcome, the valuation may be readjusted.\nContractual Obligations\n Net asset value was $5.05 per share at December 31, 2017 versus $5.16 per share at December 31, 2016.\n Our top five portfolio companies represented 28% of total assets at December 31, 2016:\nIn the valuation process, we value restricted securities, categorized as Level 3 investments, using information from these portfolio companies, which may include:\nWe hold debt securities in our investment portfolio that contain payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest provisions. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment.\nThe outstanding SBA debentures at December 31, 2017 are $8,000,000, which will mature from 2022 through 2025.\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, used in our valuation at the measurement date.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our loan and debt securities are the financial and operational performance of the portfolio company, similar debt with similar terms with other portfolio companies, current market rates for underlying risks associated with the particular company, as well as the market acceptance of the portfolio company's products or services and its future performance. These inputs will likely provide an indicator as to the probability of principal recovery of the investment. Our debt investments are often junior secured or unsecured debt securities. Fair value may also be determined based on other criteria where appropriate. Significant changes to the unobservable inputs may result in a change in fair value. For recent investments, we generally rely on the cost basis, which is deemed to represent the fair value, unless other fair market value inputs are identified causing us to depart from this basis.\n Results of Operations\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\nLoan investments are defined as traditional loan financings with no equity features. Debt investments are defined as debt financings that include one or more equity features such as conversion rights, stock purchase warrants, and/or stock purchase options. A financing may also be categorized as a debt financing if it is accompanied by the direct purchase of an equity interest in the company.\n \u2022 Net asset value of our portfolio decreased to $5.05 per share, or $31.9 million, at December 31, 2017, down ($0.11) per share, or (2.1%), compared with net asset value of $5.16 per share, or $32.6 million, at the end of the prior year. \nThe Crowdbouncer investment was written off after the company ceased doing business during 2015.\n\nOverview:\n \u2022 The portfolio generated approximately $1.5 million in interest, fee, dividend and other income. \n During the year ended December 31, 2017, one of our portfolio companies, Athenex Inc. (Athenex) completed an initial public offering and its common stock became publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cATNX\u201d. We sold our shares in Athenex and recognized a net realized gain, before income taxes, of $638,240 on the sale of the 46,296 Athenex shares.\nWe may receive distributions from portfolio companies that are limited liability companies or corporations. These distributions are classified as dividend income on the consolidated statement of operations. Dividend income is recognized on an accrual basis when it can be reasonably estimated.\nAll of these value adjustments resulted from a review by management using the guidance set forth by ASC 820 and our established valuation policy.\nOur financial condition is dependent on the success of our portfolio holdings, which are investments in small companies. The following summarizes our investment portfolio at the yearends indicated.\n \u2022 Other factors deemed relevant by our management to assess valuation. \nNet cash used by operating activities has averaged approximately $2,314,000 over the last three years. The average cash used for investments in portfolio companies has averaged approximately $6,084,000 over the last three years. Our cash flow may fluctuate based on the timing of the receipt of dividend income, realized exits and the associated income taxes paid. We will generally use cash to fund our operating expenses and to invest in companies as we build our portfolio. We anticipate that we will continue to exit investments. However, the timing of liquidation events within the portfolio is difficult to project. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any outstanding commitments to borrow funds from the SBA. Starting in 2022 (See Footnote 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) our outstanding SBA debt begins to reach maturity and this will require us to identify sources of future funding if liquidation of investments is not sufficient to fund operations and repay the SBA debt obligation.\nFees paid for board service at the portfolio companies were $1,000 and $4,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest from portfolio companies - Interest from portfolio companies was 51% higher during the year ended December 31, 2017 versus the same period in 2016 due to the fact that we have originated more income-producing debt investments in the last year. These new debt instruments were originated from Genicon Inc. (Genicon), eHealth Global Technologies, Inc. (eHealth), Empire Genomics, LLC (Empire Genomics) and several other portfolio companies.\n \u2022 Qualitative assessment of key management; \n \u2022 Loan and debt securities are valued at cost when it is representative of the fair value of the investment or sufficient assets or liquidation proceeds are expected to exist from a sale of a portfolio company at its estimated fair value. However, they may be valued at an amount other than cost given the carrying interest rate versus the related inherent portfolio risk of the investment. A loan or debt instrument may be reduced in value if it is judged to be of poor quality, collection is in doubt or insufficient liquidation proceeds exist. \nWe continue to work with the SBA in determining an optimal structure within its regulatory parameters which, once completed, may result in new SBA leverage commitments in 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our total liquidity consisted of $6,262,039 in cash.\nWe realized a loss of $300,000 on our investment in CrowdBouncer, Inc. during the year ended December 31, 2015 when the company ceased operations.\nCarolina Skiff's value was increased based on a financial analysis of the portfolio company indicating continued improved performance.\nEquity Securities\nAt the end of 2017, we had $6.3 million in cash available for future investments and expenses, a decrease from $12.3 million at the end of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to $5.4 million of investments originated during 2017 as well as funding of ongoing operating expenses.\nOur principal investment objective is to achieve long-term capital appreciation on our equity investments while maintaining a current cash flow from our debenture and pass-through equity instruments to fund our operating expenses. Therefore, we invest in a variety of financial instruments to provide a current return on a portion of the investment portfolio. The equity features contained in our investment portfolio are structured to realize capital appreciation over the long-term and typically do not generate current income in the form of dividends or interest.\nThe change in net unrealized depreciation of investments, before income taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was comprised of the following:\nThe following table summarizes the SBA leverage at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nNet Realized Gains and Losses on Investments\n \u2022 Changes in the economic environment which may have a material impact on the operating results of the portfolio company; \nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included within Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n Fee income - Fee income consists of the revenue associated with the amortization of financing fees charged to the portfolio companies upon successful closing of SBIC financings and income from portfolio company board attendance fees. The financing fees are amortized ratably over the life of the instrument associated with the fees. The unamortized fees are carried on the balance sheet under the line item \u201cDeferred revenue.\u201d\nThere may be other factors not identified that affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date when it is made and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and we cannot predict all of them.\nWe believe the change in net asset value over time is the leading valuation metric of our performance. Exits from our portfolio holdings are the key driver of growth in net asset value over time.\nDividend and other investment income - Dividend and other investment income decreased in 2016 due to the asset sale of Gemcor II, LLC in March 2016. The dividend distributions for the respective years were:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a net realized gain, before income taxes, of $262,925 on the sale of 301,582 shares of Synacor, Inc. (Synacor). Synacor trades on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \u201cSYNC\u201d. As of December 31, 2015, we did not own any shares of Synacor.\nDuring 2017, we established a second SBIC subsidiary, Rand Capital SBIC II, L.P. (Rand SBIC II) and began making investments from this SBIC subsidiary. We continue to work with the SBA in determining an optimal structure within the SBA's regulatory parameters which, once completed, may result in new SBA leverage commitments in 2018.\nInterest from other investments - The decrease in interest from other investments was primarily due to lower average cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2017 versus the year ended December 31, 2016.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nUnder the valuation policy, we value unrestricted publicly traded companies, categorized as Level 1 investments, at the average closing bid price for the last three trading days of the reporting period. There were no Level 1 or Level 2 investments as of December 31, 2017.\nOur SBIC's interest accrual is also regulated by the SBA's \u201cAccounting Standards and Financial Reporting Requirements for Small Business Investment Companies.\u201d Under these rules, interest income cannot be recognized if collection is doubtful, and a 100% reserve must be established. The collection of interest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company's ability to continue as a going concern or the loan is in default more than 120 days. Management also uses other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest.\nIntrinsiq's value was increased based on a the completion of an equity refinancing in the third quarter of 2016.\nCash approximated 20% of net assets at December 31, 2017 compared to 38% at December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 At year end, the estimated value of our portfolio, which included securities from 30 active companies, was $32.3 million. This value included $4.4 million in net pre-tax unrealized depreciation. \nWe realized a loss of $650,000 on our investment in Statisfy, Inc. (Statisfy) during the year ended December 31, 2016 when the company ceased operations.\nIn accordance with our valuation policy, we increased the value of our holdings in Athenex and Social Flow based on significant equity financings for each during 2015 with sophisticated new non-strategic outside investors at a higher valuation for each than their prior financing round valuation.\nThe Oncore, Givegab, Mercantile and Knowledge Vision investment values were decreased after we reviewed each of the portfolio company's commercial progress against their business plans and their past financial performance. These reviews indicated that deterioration of their respective businesses had occurred. If the factors which led to these reductions in valuations are overcome, the valuations may be restored.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n2017 Portfolio and Investment Activity\nThe following table shows our specified contractual obligations at December 31, 2017. We do not have any capital lease obligations or other long-term liabilities reflected on our statement of financial position.\n \u2022 Current and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations; \n\nFees paid for board service at the portfolio companies were $4,000 and $11,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAnother key factor used in valuing equity investments is a significant recent arms-length equity transaction with a sophisticated non-strategic unrelated new investor entered into by the portfolio company. The terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and us, and the impact of the difference in transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify.\n \u2022 Approximately 58% of the portfolio was equity investments with the remainder being debt and loan investments. \n\nThe valuation of our investment in Oncore was decreased after we reviewed the portfolio company and its financial condition and determined that a valuation adjustment was necessary.\nThe change in net unrealized appreciation of investments, before income taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was comprised of the following:\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n\nNet (Decrease) Increase in Unrealized Depreciation or Appreciation of Investments\nThe increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require us to closely monitor our accounting policies and procedures. We have two critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgment. The following summary of critical accounting policies is intended to enhance a reader's ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates.\nThe following table summarizes the cash estimated to be received over the next five years from existing portfolio companies based on contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017. This table does not include any escrow receivable amounts. These payments represent scheduled principal and interest payments that are due under the terms of the investment securities we own in each portfolio company and are subject to change based on factors such as conversions and restructurings. It does not include any equity investments, which may provide additional proceeds upon exit of the investment.\nFinancial assets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.\n In December 2015 we entered into an asset purchase agreement under which we agreed to sell Gemcor. The required percentage of Gemcor shareholders ratified and approved the sale in January 2016. The transaction closed in the first quarter of 2016. Based on our ownership of Gemcor, we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million at closing, before considering the $1.1 million held in escrow. Additionally, we incurred the related profit sharing expense in the first quarter of 2016. We valued our investment in Gemcor at December 31, 2015 based on an EBITDA multiple which approximated our sales proceeds.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our equity investments are earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and revenue multiples, where applicable, the financial and operational performance of the business, and the senior equity preferences that may exist in a deemed liquidation event. Standard industry multiples may be used when available; however, our portfolio companies are typically small and in early stages of development and these industry standards may be adjusted to more closely match the specific financial and operational performance of the portfolio company. Due to the nature of certain investments, fair value measurements may be based on other criteria, which may include third party appraisals. Significant changes to the unobservable inputs, such as variances in financial performance from expectations, may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.\n Fee income - The income associated with the amortization of financing fees was $22,634 and $18,333 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The financing fee income based on the existing portfolio is expected to be approximately $20,000 in 2017, $15,000 in 2018, $11,000 in 2019 and $300 in 2020.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. For a summary of all significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nOur investment in Teleservices was revalued after we reviewed their operations and their current and past financial performance. This review indicated that a further deterioration of their business had occurred. If the factors that led to this reduction in valuation are overcome, the value may be restored. The portfolio company remains in operation and is developing new business strategies.\n \u2022 We are actively involved with the governance and management of our portfolio companies, which enables us to support their operating and marketing efforts and facilitate their growth. \nValuation of Investments\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nOur principal objective is to achieve capital appreciation. Therefore, a significant portion of the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the potential for capital appreciation and may provide little or no current yield in the form of dividends or interest payments.\nstatements\u201d within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Additional oral or written forward-looking statements may be made by us from time to time, and forward-looking statements may be included in documents that are filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions and are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d or \u201cplans\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Among the important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning the state of the United States economy and the local markets in which our portfolio companies operate, the state of the securities markets in which the securities of our portfolio companies could be traded, liquidity within the United States financial markets, and inflation. Forward-looking statements are also subject to the risks and uncertainties described under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d contained in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report.\nOur principal investment objective is to achieve long-term capital appreciation on our equity investments while maintaining a current cash flow from our debenture and pass-through equity instruments to fund expenses. Therefore, we invest in a variety of financial instruments to provide a current return on a portion of the investment portfolio.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 Equity securities may be valued using the \u201casset approach\u201d, \u201cmarket approach\u201d or \u201cincome approach.\u201d The asset approach involves estimating the liquidation value of the portfolio company's assets. To the extent the value exceeds the remaining principal amount of the debt or loan securities of the portfolio company, the fair value of such securities is generally estimated to be their cost. However, where value is less than the remaining principal amount of the loan and debt securities, the Corporation may discount the value of an equity security. The market approach uses observable prices and other relevant information generated by similar market transactions. It may include the use of market multiples derived from a set of comparables to assist in pricing the investment. Additionally, the Corporation adjusts valuations if a subsequent significant equity financing has occurred that includes a meaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated, unrelated new investor. The income approach employs a cash flow and discounting methodology to value an investment.  ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:\n The valuations of our investments in Intrinsiq, Mercantile and Teleservices were decreased after we reviewed each portfolio company and its current and projected financial condition and determined that a valuation adjustment was necessary.\n \u2022 Internal circumstances and events that may have an impact (both positive and negative) on the operating performance of the portfolio company; \nAny changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the statement of operations as \u201cNet (decrease) increase in unrealized depreciation or appreciation on investments.\u201d\n Investment income decreased 64%, or $1,792,479, from $2,824,337 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1,031,858 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in dividend income caused by the sale of a large dividend producing investment, Gemcor, II, LLC (Gemcor) during 2016.\nOur investments are carried at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nInvestments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by management and approved by our Board of Directors. We invest in loan, debt, and equity instruments and there is no single standard for determining fair value of these investments. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistent valuation process. We analyze and value each investment quarterly, and record unrealized depreciation for an investment that we believe has become impaired, including where collection of a loan or realization of the recorded value of an equity security is doubtful. Conversely, we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that an underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and, therefore, its equity security has also appreciated in value. These estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events.\nThe change in net unrealized depreciation of investments, before income taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was comprised of the following:\nProfessional fees were also higher during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 2015 because we incurred additional expenses in connection with developing and implementing our long-term growth strategy. These expenses included external legal, tax consulting and other advisory expenses to support refinement of our strategy, which involved assessing options relative to the complex regulatory environment in which we operate.\n Our total investments at fair value, as estimated by management and approved by the Board of Directors, approximated 101% of net assets at December 31, 2017 and 84% of net assets at December 31, 2016.\nThe valuation of Sciaps was decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015 to revalue our equity holdings based upon liquidation preferences of our securities and on the most recent equity round of financing.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe First Wave, Intrinsiq, and Teleservices investment values were decreased during 2015 after we reviewed each of the portfolio company's progress toward commercialization and broad based acceptance of their respective business technologies and services in their respective markets. We also considered in our review the past financial performance of the companies, their forecasted cash needs, and their fundraising plans for 2016 in determining that reductions in values were appropriate. If the factors which led to the reductions in valuations are overcome, the valuations may be restored.\n During the first quarter of 2016 Gemcor II, LLC sold its assets and we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million. The realized gain from the sale, before income taxes, was $14,620,063 and included $1,100,000 that was held in escrow at December 31, 2016 and recorded on the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position in \u201cOther Assets.\u201d\n Operating expenses consist predominately of compensation expense, including profit sharing, and related benefits, interest expense on outstanding SBA borrowings, and general and administrative expenses including shareholder and office expenses and professional fees.\n \u2022 We expect that well run businesses will require capital to grow and should be able to compete effectively given the strong macroeconomic environment and eager reception of new technologies and service concepts. \nThe change in investments, at cost, during the year ended December 31, 2017, is comprised of the following:\nOur top five portfolio companies represented 37% of total assets at December 31, 2017:\nWe have historically made initial investments of $500,000 to $1,000,000 directly in companies through equity or in debt or loan instruments and frequently provided follow-on investments during our investment tenure. The debt instruments generally have a maturity of not more than five years and usually have detachable equity warrants. Interest may be paid currently or deferred, based on the investment structure negotiated.\n \u2022 Audited and unaudited statements of operations, balance sheets and operating budgets; \nThe following investments remain on non-accrual status: G-TEC Natural Gas Systems (G-Tec), First Wave Products Group, LLC (First Wave) and a portion of the Mercantile Adjustment Bureau, LLC (Mercantile) outstanding loan balance.\nInterest income generally is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt. In such cases, interest income is recognized at the time of receipt. A reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate.\nInterest from portfolio companies - Our portfolio interest income increased during 2016 due to the addition of several large debt instruments in late 2015 and throughout 2016. The new debt instruments were originated from Genicon Inc. (Genicon), eHealth Global Technologies, Inc. (eHealth), Empire Genomics, LLC (Empire Genomics), SciAps, Inc. (Sciaps) and several other portfolio companies.\nWe account for our operations under GAAP for investment companies. The principal measure of our financial performance is \u201cnet (decrease) increase in net assets from operations\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the net decrease in net assets from operations was ($710,678) as compared with net decrease of ($1,202,683) in 2016 and a net increase of $1,500,219 in 2015.\nExpenses\n \u2022 Current information regarding any offers to purchase the investment, or recent fundraising transactions; \nStatements included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Report that do not relate to present or historical conditions are \u201cforward-looking\nFinancial Condition\nInterest from other investments - The increase in interest from other investments was primarily due to higher average cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLoans and Debt Securities\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the investment portfolio consisted of the following types of investments:\nDividend and other investment income - Dividend income is comprised of cash distributions from limited liability companies (LLCs) and corporations in which we have invested. Our investment agreements with certain LLCs require those LLCs to distribute funds to us for payment of income taxes on our allocable share of the LLC's profits. These portfolio companies may also elect to make additional discretionary distributions. Dividend income will fluctuate based upon the profitability of these LLCs and corporations and the timing of the distributions or the impact of new investments or divestitures. The dividend distributions for the respective periods were:\n \u2022 Current ability of the portfolio company to raise additional financing if needed; \nThe valuation of our investment in Knoa was decreased during 2016 to value our equity at liquidation value.\n \u2022 We have sufficient cash to invest in new opportunities and to repurchase shares. At year end, we had authorization to repurchase an additional 458,954 shares of our Common Stock. However, our prioritized use of cash continues to be growing our portfolio.  Critical Accounting Policies\nThe decrease in expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 versus the same period in 2016 was primarily caused by a decrease of $1,373,052 in bonus and profit sharing expense related to the Gemcor II, LLC (Gemcor) exit in early 2016. Gemcor sold its assets in March 2016 and based on our ownership percentage, we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $13.8 million, excluding an escrow receivable, and realized a gain, before income taxes, of approximately $13.2 million from the sale. As a result of this sale, we recognized $1,385,052 under our Profit Sharing Plan during the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no amounts earned pursuant to the Profit Sharing Plan for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 Current and projected financial, operational and technological developments of the portfolio company; \nRevenue Recognition\nWe may exit investments through the maturation of a debt security or when a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale, recapitalization, or initial public offering of a portfolio company. The method and timing of the disposition of our portfolio investments can be critical to the realization of maximum total return. We generally expect to dispose of our equity securities through private sales of securities to other investors or through an outright sale of the portfolio company or a merger. We anticipate our debt investments will be repaid with interest and hope to realize further appreciation from the warrants or other equity type instruments we receive in connection with the investment. We fund new investments and operating expenses through existing cash balances, investment returns, and interest and principal payments from our portfolio companies\nEquity Securities may include preferred stock, common stock, warrants and limited liability company membership interests.\nWhen appropriate the Black-Scholes pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of warrants for accounting purposes. This model requires the use of highly subjective inputs including expected volatility and expected life, in addition to variables for the valuation of minority equity positions in small private and early stage companies. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.\nWe believe the combination of cash on hand, proceeds from portfolio exits, potential additional SBA leverage, and prospective investment income provide sufficient capital for us to continue to add new investments to our portfolio while reinvesting in existing portfolio companies that demonstrate continued growth potential. The following short and long-term trends provide us confidence in our ability to grow Rand:\nLevel 3: Unobservable and significant inputs to determining the fair value.\n Below is the geographic breakdown of our investments at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThe income associated with the amortization of financing fees was $24,091 and $22,634 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The financing fee income based on the existing portfolio is expected to be approximately $21,000 in 2018, $15,000 in 2019 and $2,000 in 2020.\nOutlook\nThe Somerset investment value was decreased during 2015 after a review of the company's financial performance and the overall weakness in the oil and gas sector.\nWe hold preferred equity securities that may contain cumulative dividend provisions. Cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income when they are declared and deemed a contractual obligation. Any dividends in arrears are added to the balance of the preferred equity investment. The actual collection of these dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed.\nComposition of the Investment Portfolio\n \u2022 The current capital structure of the business and the seniority of the various classes of equity if a deemed liquidation event were to occur; \nIn accordance with our valuation policy, we adjusted the value of our investments in ACV, Beetnpath and Sciaps based on a significant equity financing by a new non-strategic outside entity, and consideration of the related affect on the liquidation preferences of our existing investment instrument in each of the companies. In addition, our investments in Carolina Skiff and Knoa were increased based on a financial analysis of each portfolio company indicating improved performance.\nWe are an internally managed investment company that lends to and invests in small companies often concurrently with other investors. We have elected to be treated as a business development company (\u201cBDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d). As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We have historically made the majority of our investments through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Rand Capital SBIC, Inc. (\u201cRand SBIC\u201d), which operates as a small business investment company (\u201cSBIC\u201d) and has been licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) since 2002. During 2017, we established a second SBIC subsidiary, Rand Capital SBIC II, L.P. (Rand SBIC II) and began making investments from this SBIC subsidiary. We continue to work with the SBA in determining an optimal structure within its regulatory parameters which, once completed, may result in new SBA leverage commitments in 2018.\nIn addition, we recorded a realized gain of $168,140 during the year ended December 31, 2016 from the earn out provision in connection with the 2014 sale of QuaDPharma, LLC to Athenex Inc.\nInvestment Income\n \u2022 Pending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company; \nOur largest portfolio company, in terms of fair value, Gemcor II, LLC (Gemcor) sold its assets during March 2016 and, based on our ownership percentage, we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million. The realized gain from the sale, before income taxes, was $14,620,063 and included $1,100,000 that continued to be held in escrow at December 31, 2016. The escrow holdback is recorded in \u201cOther Assets\u201d on the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position. The escrow was released during 2017. Related to this asset sale, we accrued $1,270,052 under our Profit Sharing Plan for the year ended December 31, 2016, that is payable to our executive officers. Recording of the profit sharing expense is primarily based on net realized gains, which may be in years subsequent to when the unrealized appreciation is recognized on the underlying investments in the financial statements. This may cause a recognition of profit sharing expense in a period later than when the appreciation is recognized, as was the case in 2016. There were no amounts earned pursuant to the Profit Sharing Plan for the year ended December 31, 2015.", "item_7_tables": "Table 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value at\nDecember 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Assets\nat December 31,\n2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Genicon, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Health Care - Testing Device </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,023,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> eHealth Global Technologies, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Health Care </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,500,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rheonix, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Health Care - Testing Device </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,938,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tilson Technology Management, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Professional Services </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,500,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outmatch Holdings, LLC\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Software </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,145,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reclassify Gemcor II, LLC (Gemcor) to a realized gain\n</td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>12,775,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Teleservices Solutions Holdings, LLC (Teleservices)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(990,680 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Knoa Software, Inc.

Total investment income increased 41% to $1.5 million in 2017. \n\n- Expenses decreased 41% to $2 million in 2017 due to lower profit sharing expense related to the sale of Gemcor II in 2016.\n\n- In 2017, $5.4 million of new investments were made in 8 companies, including 1 new portfolio company.\n\n- The portfolio had interest-generating debt investments and equity investments, with equity being the majority at 58% of the portfolio value.\n\n- Cash position decreased from 38% of net assets at end of 2016 to 20% at end of 2017, primarily due to new investments. \n\n- SBA debentures outstanding were $8 million at end of both 2016 and 2017. Maturities on debentures begin in 2022.\n\n- The company believes it has sufficient capital resources from portfolio exits, SBA leverage and investment income to meet needs in 2018. It continues to pursue portfolio exits to increase liquidity.\n\nIn summary, the portfolio value increased in 2017 but net asset value decreased slightly. Liquidity remains adequate to operate and make new investments in 2018. The company made significant new debt and equity investments in 2017."}
