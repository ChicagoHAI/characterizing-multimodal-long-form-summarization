Our services include management, marketing, technology, and policy consulting, and implementation services. We help our clients conceive, develop, implement, and improve solutions that address complex business, natural resource, social, technological, and public safety issues. Our services primarily support clients that operate in four key markets:\n\u2022 Energy, Environment, and Infrastructure;\n\u2022 Health, Education, and Social Programs;\n\u2022 Safety and Security; and\n\u2022 Consumer and Financial.\nDrawing from our domain knowledge and staff experience in working in multi-disciplinary teams for clients in a variety of markets, we provide services to our diverse client base that deliver value throughout the entire life cycle of a policy, program, project, or initiative. Our primary services include:\n\u2022 Advisory Services;\n\u2022 Program Implementation Services;\n\u2022 Analytics Services;\n\u2022 Digital Services; and\n\u2022 Engagement Services.\nOur clients utilize our services because we combine diverse institutional knowledge and experience with the deep subject matter expertise of our highly educated staff, which we deploy in multi-disciplinary teams. We have successfully worked with many of our clients for decades, with the result that we have a thorough and nuanced perspective of their objectives and needs. We serve both governmental and commercial clients. Our government clients include those from departments and agencies of the federal government, state (including territories) and local governments, and international governments. Our government efforts include work performed under subcontract agreements to commercial clients whose ultimate customer is government agencies and departments.\nOur largest clients are U.S. federal government departments and agencies. In fact, our federal government clients have included every cabinet-level department, most significantly HHS, DOS, and DoD. Federal government clients generated approximately 44%, 38%, and 41% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. State and local government clients generated approximately 15%, 19%, and 14% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. International government clients generated approximately 6%, 8%, and 9% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nWe also serve a variety of commercial clients worldwide, including: airlines, airports, electric and gas utilities, health care companies, banks and other financial services companies, transportation, travel and hospitality firms, non-profits/associations, manufacturing firms, retail chains, and distribution companies. Our commercial clients, which include clients outside the U.S., generated approximately 35%, 35%, and 36% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nWe report operating results and financial data as a single segment based on the consolidated information used by our chief operating decision-maker in evaluating the financial performance of our business and allocating resources. Our single segment represents our core business: professional services for government and commercial clients. Although we describe our multiple service offerings to clients that operate in four markets to provide a better understanding of the scope and scale of our business, we do not manage our business or allocate our resources based on those service offerings or client markets. Rather, on a project-by-project basis, we assemble the best team from throughout the enterprise to deliver highly customized solutions that are tailored to meet the needs of each client.\nNotwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, we believe that, in the long-term, demand for our services will continue to grow as government, industry, and other stakeholders seek to address critical long-term societal and natural resource issues due to heightened concerns about clean energy and energy efficiency; health promotion, treatment, and cost control; natural disaster relief and rebuild efforts; and ongoing homeland security threats. In the wake of the major hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, Maria, Laura and Michael) that devastated communities in Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, the affected areas remain in various stages of relief and recovery efforts. We believe our prior and current experience with disaster relief and rebuild efforts, including those from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and Superstorm Sandy, put us in a favorable position to continue to provide recovery and housing assistance, and environmental and infrastructure solutions on behalf of federal departments and agencies, state, territorial and local jurisdictions, and regional agencies.\nWe also see significant opportunity to further leverage our digital and client engagement capabilities across our commercial and government client base. Our future results will depend on the success of our strategy to enhance our client relationships and seek larger engagements that span the entire program life cycle, and to complete and successfully integrate additional strategic acquisitions. We will continue to focus on building scale in vertical and horizontal domain expertise, developing business with both our government and commercial clients, and replicating our business model in selective geographies. In doing so, we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities, such as our recent acquisition of ITG, that enhance our subject matter knowledge, broaden our service offerings, and/or provide scale in specific geographies. Although we continue to see favorable long-term market opportunities, there are certain business challenges facing all government service providers. Administrative and legislative actions by the federal government to address changing priorities or in response to the budget deficit could have a negative impact on our business, which may result in a reduction to our revenue and profit and adversely affect cash flow. Similarly, the very nature of opportunities arising out of disaster recovery mean they can involve unusual challenges. Factors such as the overall stress on communities and people affected by disaster recovery situations, political complexities and challenges among involved government agencies, and a higher-than-normal risk of audits and investigations may result in a reduction to our revenue and profit and adversely affect cash flow. However, we believe we are well positioned to provide a broad range of services in support of initiatives that will continue to be priorities to the federal government, as well as to state and local and international governments and commercial clients. We believe that the combination of internally generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, potential acquisitions, customary capital expenditures, and other working capital requirements.\nOur results of operations and cash flows may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Progress of contract performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Extraordinary economic events and natural disasters;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Number of billable days in a quarter;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Timing of client orders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Timing of award fee notices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in the scope of contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Variations in purchasing patterns under our contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Federal and state and local governments' and other clients' spending levels;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Federal government shutdowns;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Timing of billings to, and collection of payments from clients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Timing of receipt of invoices from, and payments to, employees and vendors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Commencement, completion, and termination of contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Strategic decisions, such as acquisitions, consolidations, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments, and changes in business strategy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Timing of significant costs and investments (such as bid and proposal costs and the costs involved in planning or making acquisitions);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Timing of events related to discrete tax items;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our contract mix and use of subcontractors or the timing of other direct costs for which we may earn lower contract margin;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in contract margin performance due to performance risks;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Additions to, and departures of, staff;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in staff utilization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Paid time off taken by our employees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level and cost of our debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in accounting principles and policies; and/or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> General market and economic conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause a significant portion of our expenses (such as personnel, facilities, and related costs) are fixed in the short-term, contract performance and variation in the volume of activity, as well as in the number and volume of contracts commenced or completed during any year, may cause significant variations in operating results from year to year. We generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years, although we cannot ensure that we will be able to do so in the future.\nIMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel strain of coronavirus disease COVID-19 as a global pandemic. There continues to be significant uncertainty as to the effects of this pandemic on the global economy, which may impact, among other things, our operations, balance sheet, results of operations or cash flows. Adverse events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel, the potential impact on our employees, clients, subcontractors and other suppliers and business partners, a slow-down in customer decision-making that affects procurement cycles, a reprioritization of client spending, and other matters affecting the general work and business environment have harmed, and could continue to harm, our business and delay the implementation of our business strategy. We cannot fully anticipate all the ways in which the current global health crisis, economic slowdown and financial market conditions will adversely impact our business in the future. The longer the duration of the pandemic, the advent of new strains of the virus and challenges faced in the rollout of vaccines, the more likely it is that it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe are primarily a service business, and our staffing, and that of our subcontractors, has been maintained, substantially on a work from home basis, fortunately with little COVID-19 illness among our staff. To date we have experienced continuity in the majority of our work for our government clients, which accounted for approximately 65% of our revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There have been postponements of events and challenges around some project work requiring travel, but overall, our government clients have continued to require our services. We are unable to predict whether, and to what extent, this trend will continue. It would be reasonable to expect that some deterioration of certain client activities has occurred and will continue to occur due to COVID-19, but there is also the possibility of additional demand from federal agencies such as the CDC, HHS, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as state and local and international government agencies.\nOf the remaining 35% of our total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the majority was generated from commercial energy markets and commercial marketing services, each of which represented roughly half of that total. In commercial energy, where we work primarily for utility clients, we have experienced trends similar to those with our government clients, although some aspects of energy efficiency programs have been put on hold as they involve direct interaction with consumers. In our commercial marketing services, a key component of our business is our industry-leading loyalty platform, where we have long-term implementation contracts, and we believe our clients, many of which are in the hospitality space, will continue to stay engaged with their most loyal customers. The other parts of commercial marketing services, which include public event management and marketing technology, were impacted based on the restriction upon travel worldwide and the deferral or cancellation of marketing events. Some of these commercial clients perform work in travel-related markets and have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we are monitoring that business area closely. These elements of commercial marketing services represented less than 16% of our total Company-wide revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nWe are monitoring the evolving situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic and we continue to work with our stakeholders to assess further possible implications to our business and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. To protect employee health and safety while COVID-19 remains a threat, we plan to continue to deliver a majority of our services to clients remotely for the foreseeable future and continue to evaluate our return to office plans. While the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act contains a provision that allows federal contractors to seek specified reimbursement for certain employees who are unable to perform their contract requirements due to government restrictions, we believe we have limited claims under the CARES Act, and reimbursements are also subject to limitations and do not extend past December 31, 2020. Additionally, we exercised the option to defer payment of the employer portion of the Social Security tax, with 50% to be repaid by December 31, 2021 and the remainder by December 31, 2022. We deferred payment of approximately $20.9 million of employer Social Security taxes during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nAs part of management actions to counter the impact of COVID-19, we continue to align our costs with anticipated revenues. In the U.S. and in our international operations, we have used staff reductions, furloughs, and other temporary wage reduction programs in response to the pandemic. We incurred $2.1 million in severance costs related to unanticipated terminations associated with COVID-19. We are currently participating in several international government subsidy programs, providing approximately $3.0 million as of December 31, 2020, whose objective is to encourage eligible companies to keep employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. A requirement of these subsidies is that we continue to employ the identified employees who might otherwise have been impacted by a reaction to COVID-19. The subsidies are limited in the amount and time in which payroll costs are covered.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nA key element of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions. In 2018, we acquired The Future Customer ( TFC\u201d), DMS Disaster Consultants ( DMS\u201d), and We Are Vista Limited ( Vista\u201d). In January 2020 and December 2020, we completed the acquisitions of ITG and Eco-Tech Consultants, Inc. ( Eco-Tech\u201d). While providing capabilities and access to new clients in support of our growth strategy, these acquisitions were not significant to our financial statements taken as a whole.\nThe Future Customer - In January 2018, we acquired TFC, a leading boutique loyalty strategy and marketing company based in London, U.K. The acquisition of TFC enhanced and extended our customer loyalty business to Europe.\nDMS Disaster Consultants - In August 2018, we acquired DMS, a disaster management and recovery firm based in Florida, to broaden our capabilities in support of assisting communities, businesses and individuals recover from man-made and nature disasters. DMS assists public sector clients with man-made and natural disaster planning and preparedness, and post-disaster response and recovery efforts by assisting clients in obtaining federal funding from Federal the Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), insurance companies, and other sources.\nWe Are Vista Limited - In October 2018, we acquired Vista, a communications company headquartered in Leeds, U.K., with an additional presence in London. Vista provides advisory services and solutions to clients in the financial, retail, automobile, and energy industries and broadens our capabilities in the region.\nIncentive Technology Group, LLC - In January 2020, we completed the acquisition of ITG, one of the leading providers of cloud-based platform services to the federal government. ITG provides solutions through the adoption of next generation technologies for federal government agencies, many of which are among our long-standing clients.\nEco-Tech Consultants, Inc. - In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Eco-Tech, an ecological consulting firm located in Louisville, Kentucky. The firm provides a range of ecological services across the Eastern United States and will greatly increase our capacity to support a growing portfolio of transportation agency clients in the Eastern United States.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses during the reporting period and our application of critical accounting policies, including: revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. If any of these estimates or judgments prove to be incorrect, our reported results could be materially affected. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting practices described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and, therefore, consider them to be critical accounting policies. Significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies listed below, are more fully described and discussed in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nRevenue Recognition\nWe primarily provide services and technology-based solutions for clients that operate in a variety of markets and the solutions may span the entire program life cycle, from initial research and analysis to the design and implementation of solutions. We enter into agreements with clients that create enforceable rights and obligations and for which it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we will be entitled as services and solutions are transferred to the client. Except in certain narrowly defined situations, our agreements with our clients are written and revenue is generally not recognized on oral or implied arrangements. We recognize revenue based on the consideration specified in the applicable agreement and exclude from revenue amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Accordingly, sales and similar taxes which are collected for third parties are excluded from the transaction price.\nWe also evaluate whether two or more agreements should be accounted for as one single contract and whether combined or single agreements should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. For most contracts, the client requires that we perform a number of tasks in providing an integrated output and, hence, each of these contracts is tracked as having only one performance obligation. When contracts are separated into multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised services underlying each performance obligation. We generally provide customized solutions in which the pricing is based on specific negotiations with each client, and, in these cases, we use a cost-plus margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. It is common for our long-term contracts to contain award fees, incentive fees or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts are generally awarded at the completion of a prescribed performance assessment period based on the achievement of performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, and the amount awarded may be subject to client discretion. Variable consideration is estimated based on the most likely amount. Estimates of variable consideration will be constrained only to the extent that it is probable that significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nWe evaluate contractual arrangements to determine whether revenue should be recognized on a gross versus net basis. Our assessment is based on the nature of the promise to the client. In most cases, we agree to provide specified services to the client as a principal and revenue is recognized on a gross basis. In certain instances, we act as an agent and merely arrange for another party to provide services to the client and revenue is recognized on a net basis in reflection of the fact that we do not control the goods or services provided to the client by the other party.\nLong-term contracts typically contain billing terms that provide for invoicing monthly or upon completion of milestones and payment on a net 30-day basis. Exceptions to monthly billing terms are to ensure that we perform satisfactorily rather than representing a significant financing component. For cost-based contracts, our performance is evaluated during a contractually stipulated performance period and, while contract costs may be billed on a monthly basis, we are generally permitted to bill for incentive or award fees only after the completion of the performance assessment period, which may occur quarterly, semi-annually or annually, and after the client completes the performance assessment. Fixed-price contracts may provide for milestone billings based on the attainment of specific project objectives and, since they are tied to our project performance, these type of billing terms do not represent a significant financing component. Moreover, contracts may require retentions or hold backs that are paid at the end of the contract to ensure that we perform in accordance with requirements which do not represent our providing financing to our clients but rather are a means to ensure that we meet contract requirements. We do not assess whether a contract contains a significant financing component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between payment by the client and the transfer of promised services to the client will be one year or less.\nAs a service provider, we generally recognize revenue over time as control is transferred to a client, based on the extent of progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. The selection of the method used to measure progress requires judgment and, among other things, is dependent on the contract type selected by the client during contract negotiation and the nature of the services and solutions to be provided.\nWhen a performance obligation is billed using a time-and-materials contract type, we use the right to invoice practical expedient output progress measures to estimate revenue earned based on hours worked in contract performance at negotiated billing rates. Fixed-price level-of-effort contracts are substantially similar to time-and-materials contracts except that we are required to deliver a specified level of effort over a stated period of time. For these contracts, we estimate revenue earned using contract hours worked at negotiated bill rates as we deliver the contractually required workforce.\nFor cost-based contracts, we recognize revenue as a single performance obligation based on contract costs incurred, as we become contractually entitled to reimbursement of the contract costs, plus a most likely estimate of award or incentive fees earned on those costs even though final determination of fees earned occurs after the contractually stipulated performance assessment period ends.\nFor performance obligations requiring the delivery of a service for a fixed price, we use the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs, provided that costs incurred (an input method) represents a reasonable measure of progress towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation, in order to estimate the portion of total revenue earned. This method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of value to the client when we are satisfying a performance obligation that entails integration of tasks for a combined output, which requires us to coordinate the work of employees, subcontractors and delivery of other contract costs. Contract costs that are not reflective of our progress toward satisfying a performance obligation are not included in the calculation of the measure of progress. When this method is used, changes in estimated costs to complete these obligations result in adjustments to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis, which causes the effect of revised estimates for prior periods to be recognized in the current period. Changes in these estimates can routinely occur over contract performance for a variety of reasons, which include: changes in contract scope; changes in contract cost estimates due to unanticipated cost growth or reassessments of risks impacting costs; changes in estimated incentive or award fees; or performing better or worse than previously estimated.\nIn some fixed price service contracts, we perform services of a recurring nature, such as maintenance and other services of a stand ready\u201d nature. For these contracts, we have the right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value that the client has received. Therefore, we record revenue on a time-elapsed basis to reflect the transfer of control to the client throughout the contract.\nOur operating cycle for long-term contracts may be greater than one year and is measured by the average time intervening between the inception and the completion of those contracts. Contract-related assets and liabilities, as highlighted below, are classified as current assets and current liabilities. Significant balance sheet accounts related to the revenue recognition cycle are as follows:\nContract receivables, net - This account includes amounts billed or billable under contract terms. The amounts due are stated at their net realizable value. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected. We consider a number of factors in our estimate of the allowance, including knowledge of a client's financial condition, its historical collection experience, and other factors relevant to assessing the collectability of the receivables.\nContract assets - This account includes unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized on contracts when the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amounts billed. It also includes contract retainages until we have met the contract-stipulated requirements for payment. Contract assets are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis each period even though individual contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. On a contract-by-contract basis, amounts do not exceed their net realizable value.\nContract liabilities - This account consists of advance payments received and billings in excess of revenue recognized on contracts. Contract liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis each period even though individual contracts may contain multiple performance obligations.\nRevenue recognition entails the use of significant judgment, including, but not limited to, the following: evaluating agreements in terms of the number and nature of performance obligations; determining the appropriate method for measuring progress of the satisfaction of obligations; and preparing estimates in terms of the amount of progress that we have made. Most of our revenue is recognized over time and for many fixed-price contracts, in particular, we estimate the proportion of total revenue earned using the ratio of contract costs incurred to total estimated contract costs, which requires us to prepare estimates as work progresses of contract cost left to be incurred. Moreover, some of our contracts include variable consideration, which requires us to estimate the most likely amounts that will be earned over the respective contractually stipulated performance assessment periods. For these obligations, changes in estimates result in cumulative catch-up adjustments and may have a significant impact on earnings during a given period.\nPayments on cost-based contracts with the U.S. Federal government are provisional payments subject to audit and adjustment. Our USAID-cognizant indirect cost rates have been finalized through December 31, 2014, and its NIH-cognizant cost rates have been finalized through December 31, 2011. Contract revenue have been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final audit and cost settlement and we do not believe any additional, material revenue adjustments will result from finalizing the indirect rates and closing open audit years.\nWe prepare client invoices in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract, and billing terms may not be directly related to the performance of services. Contract assets are invoiced based on the achievement of specific events as defined by each contract, including deliverables, timetables, and incurrence of certain costs. Contract assets are classified as a current asset. Advanced billings to clients in excess of revenue earned are recorded as contract liabilities until the revenue recognition criteria are met. Reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses are included in revenue with corresponding costs incurred by us included in the cost of revenue. We record revenue net of taxes collected from clients when the taxes are collected on behalf of the governmental authorities.\nWe may proceed with work based on client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents. We have a review process for approving any such work. Revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated, and realization is probable. We base our estimates on a variety of factors, including previous experiences with the client, communications with the client regarding funding status, and our knowledge of available funding for the contract.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over such lives and reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators arise. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill and intangibles assets were $909.9 million and $59.9 million, respectively.\nFor the purpose of performing the annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2020, as our business is highly integrated and all of our components have similar economic characteristics, we have concluded we have one aggregated reporting unit at a consolidated entity level. We assess goodwill at the reporting level. For the goodwill impairment test, we opted to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, we may conclude that no impairment exists. If we conclude otherwise, a goodwill impairment test must be performed, which includes a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognizing, as an impairment loss, the difference of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying amount.\nOur qualitative analysis as of October 1, 2020 included macroeconomic and industry and market-specific considerations, financial performance indicators and measurements, and other factors. Based on this qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our one reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, and thus the impairment test was not required to be performed. Historically, we have not recorded any impairment charges for goodwill.\nWe are required to review other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2020 management evaluated its existing operating lease facilities and elected to discontinue the use of 16 leased facilities in advance of the lease termination date resulting in a $4.9 million charge for early contract termination. The $4.9 million charge included $3.1 million of impairment, $1.5 million of termination fees and $0.3 million of a loss on the disposition of related fixed assets and other costs.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes are calculated from consolidated income based on current tax laws and any changes in tax rates from the rates used previously in determining the deferred tax assets and liabilities from temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and amounts on our tax returns.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate our ability to benefit from all deferred tax assets and establish valuation allowances for amounts we believe are not more likely than not to be realized.\nWe use a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the income tax position taken to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured in order to determine the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements. Penalties, if probable and reasonably estimable, and interest expense related to uncertain tax positions are not recognized as a component of income tax expense but recorded separately in indirect expenses or interest expense, respectively.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe ICF International, Inc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended, (the 2018 Omnibus Plan\u201d) provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, and other stock-based awards to all officers, key employees, and non-employee directors. The 2018 Omnibus Plan replaced the previous 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Prior Plan\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 1,107,968 shares available for grant under the 2018 Omnibus Plan.\nWe utilize cash settled RSUs ( CSRSUs\u201d) which are settled only in cash payments. The cash payment is calculated by multiplying the number of CSRSUs vested by our closing stock price on the vesting date, subject to a maximum payment cap and a minimum payment floor. CSRSUs have no impact on the shares available for grant under the 2018 Omnibus Plan and have no impact on the calculated shares used in EPS calculations.\nWe began granting awards of registered shares to our non-employee directors on an annual basis under the 2018 Omnibus Plan in the third quarter of 2018. Previously, under the Prior Plan, we granted awards of unregistered shares to the directors under the Annual Equity Election program. Those awards were issued from treasury stock and had no impact on the shares available for grant under the Prior Plan.\nWe recognized total compensation expense relating to stock-based compensation of $24.6 million, $26.0 million, and $19.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock awards, and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We treat CSRSUs as liability-classified awards, and account for them at fair value based on the closing price of our stock at the balance sheet date. We recognize expense for performance-based share awards ( PSAs\u201d), which are subject to a performance condition and a market condition, on a straight-line basis over the performance period. Non-employee director awards are expensed over the performance period.\nStock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of these instruments and the estimated number of shares ultimately expected to vest. The calculation of the fair value of the awards requires certain inputs that are subjective and changes to the estimates used will cause the fair value of stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense to vary. The fair value of stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs, PSAs and non-employee director awards is estimated based on the fair value of a share of common stock at the grant date. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The fair value of a stock option award is affected by the price of our stock on the date of grant, as well as other assumptions used as inputs in the valuation model. These assumptions include the estimated volatility of the price of our stock over the term of the awards, the estimated period of time that we expect employees will hold stock options, and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of PSAs is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\nWe are required to adjust stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. We estimate the rate of future forfeitures based on factors which include our historical experience, but the amount of actual forfeitures may differ from current estimates particularly if the rate of future forfeitures is different from previous experience. In addition, the estimation of PSAs that will ultimately vest requires judgment in terms of estimates of future performance. To the extent actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures and actual performance or updated performance estimates differ from current estimates, such expense amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates are revised. See Note 15-Accounting for Stock-based Compensation\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for further discussion.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNew accounting standards are discussed in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nSELECTED KEY METRICS\nIn order to evaluate operations, we track revenue by key metrics that provide useful information about the nature of our operations. Client markets provide insight into the breadth of our expertise. Client type is an indicator of the diversity of our client base. Revenue by contract mix provides insight in terms of the degree of performance risk that we have assumed. Significant variances in the key metrics tables that are provided below are discussed under the revenue section of the results of operations.\nClient markets\nThe following table shows revenue generated from client markets as a percent of total revenue for the periods indicated. For each client, we have attributed all revenue from that client to the market we consider to be the client's primary market, even if a portion of that revenue relates to a different market. Certain minor revenue amounts reported in the prior years have been reclassified within key market categories based on our current view of the client's primary market in order to increase comparability of the current year to prior years.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy, environment, and infrastructure\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 616,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 663,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 564,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Health, education, and social programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 670,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 567,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 535,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Safety and security\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 117,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and financial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 125,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,506,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,478,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,337,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary clients are the agencies and departments of the federal government and commercial clients.

December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nRevenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $1,506.9 million, compared to $1,478.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $28.4 million or 1.9%. The increase in revenue was attributable to an increase in governmental revenue of $22.5 million, or 2.3%, and an increase in commercial revenue of $5.8 million, or 1.1%, compared to the prior year. The changes in government revenue by client type were driven by the increase in federal government revenue, including clients from the ITG acquisition, offset by a decrease in state and local government revenue, from our disaster recovery clients, and a decrease in international government revenue. The increase in our commercial revenue by client market was driven by increases in revenue from energy, environment and infrastructure clients and health, education, and social program clients, including clients from our ITG acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in marketing services provided to our consumer and financial clients, which have been impacted by COVID-19, compared to the prior year. The governmental and commercial revenues as a percent of total revenue remained consistent at 65% and 35% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with 65% and 35% for the prior year.\nDirect costs. Direct costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $972.4 million compared to $953.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $19.2 million or 2.0%. The increase in direct costs and associated fringe costs was attributable to an increase of $31.6 million in direct labor and associated fringe benefits costs offset by a $12.4 million decrease in subcontractor and other direct costs. The direct labor and associated fringe costs increase is the result of an increase in our federal government revenues, as discussed above, partially offset by the decline in direct labor in our international government clients and our commercial clients. The decrease in subcontractor and other direct costs is due to the decline in other direct costs of $12.0 million, primarily travel related costs offset by an increase in media buys, and a $0.4 million decline in subcontractor costs. The decline in subcontractor costs is due to the decline in revenue from contracts that are reliant upon subcontractors, such as the hurricane relief and recovery efforts and marketing services, offset by subcontractor costs from the ITG acquisition. Direct costs as a percent of revenue remained constant at 64.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIndirect and selling expenses. Indirect and selling expenses generally include our management, facilities, and infrastructure costs for all employees and the salaries and wages related to indirect activities, including stock-based and cash-based incentive compensation provided to employees whose compensation and other benefit costs are included in indirect and selling expenses, plus associated fringe benefits not directly related to client engagements.\nIndirect and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $411.6 million compared to $395.8 million for the prior year, an increase of $15.8 million or 4.0%. The increase in indirect and selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in indirect labor, associated fringe costs, and other compensation costs of $25.6 million, and a decrease in general and administrative costs of $9.8 million. The increase in indirect labor, associated fringe costs, and other compensation costs is due to the general increase in labor year over year and additional severance costs from our internal restructuring and $8.8 million expense related to obligations under the Executive Chair's employment agreement. The decrease in general and administrative costs was due to a reduction of travel-related expenses of $10.3 million, a decrease related to the $1.7 million impairment of intangible assets in the prior year, a decrease in our use of contract labor in the current year, and the decline in non-labor related administrative costs in the current year, offset by increases in the current year of $4.4 million of expenses related to the termination, abandonment, or impairment of several operating leases, a $3.4 million increase in bad debt expenses, and other increased costs due to our investments in our internal infrastructure and processes, and professional fees and insurance costs associated with our acquisition activities. Indirect and selling expenses as a percent of revenue increased to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 26.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in indirect and selling expenses as a percent of revenue is due to expenses in 2020 related to termination of operating leases and expenses related to the departing officer's employment in our indirect and selling expenses for the year ending December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $20.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $0.3 million or 1.5%. The increase in depreciation and amortization is the result of additional leasehold improvements acquired as part of the ITG acquisition which was offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization as a result of accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements on leases that terminated during the prior year.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13.3 million compared to $8.1 million for the prior year. The $5.3 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of additional intangible assets related to the ITG acquisition totaling $47.3 million, partially offset by reduced levels of amortization of intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions.\nOperating income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, operating income was $89.1 million compared to $101.4 million for the prior year, a decrease of $12.3 million or 12.1%. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 5.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 6.9% for the prior year. The changes were largely due to an increase in indirect and selling expenses, associated with expense related to obligations under the Executive Chair's employment agreement, and an increase in amortization of intangible assets partially offset by higher revenues.\nInterest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense was $13.9 million, compared to $10.7 million for the prior year, an increase of $3.2 million or 29.6%. The higher interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was due to higher average debt balances, primarily due to the financing of the ITG acquisition, partially offset by lower average interest rates for the period ended December 31, 2020 compared to the period ended December 31, 2019.\nOther expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expense was flat at $0.5 million compared to other expense of $0.5 million for the prior year.\nProvision for income taxes. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, was 26.4% and 23.6%, respectively. Our effective tax rate, including state and foreign taxes net of federal benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, was higher than the statutory tax rate for the year primarily due to tax benefits for stock-based compensation, permanently non-taxable income and state tax credits, and partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, permanent differences related to compensation costs, and other expenses not deductible for tax purposes.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nThese following tables provide reconciliations of financial measures that are not U.S. GAAP ( non-GAAP\u201d) to the most applicable U.S. GAAP measures. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating our financial information, they should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies may define similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently and, accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how we define these measures.\nService Revenue\nService revenue represents revenue less subcontractor and other direct costs (which include third-party materials and travel expenses). Service revenue is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to revenue as a measure of operating performance. This presentation of service revenue may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may use different methods to prepare similarly titled measures. We believe service revenue is a useful measure to investors since, as a consulting firm, a key metric is revenue generated from the services our employees provide to our clients. For the year ended December 31, 2020, service revenue grew $40.7 million or 4.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, service revenue represented 69.3% of total revenue compared to 67.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We believe EBITDA is useful in assessing ongoing trends and, as a result, may provide greater visibility in understanding our operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations. We evaluate these adjustments on an individual basis based on both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including their size and nature, as well as whether or not we expect them to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We believe that the adjustments applied in calculating adjusted EBITDA are reasonable and appropriate to provide additional information to investors.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be used as alternatives to net income as a measure of operating performance. This presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may use different methods to prepare similarly titled measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management's discretionary use as these measures do not include certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, capital expenditures and debt service.\nA reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA follows:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December

On March 3, 2020, we entered into the First Amendment (the First Amendment\u201d) to the Fifth Amended and Restated Business Loan and Security Agreement with a group of 10 lenders (the Credit Facility\u201d). The First Amendment amended the Fifth Amended and Restated Business Loan and Security Agreement, entered on May 17, 2017. As a result of the First Amendment, we increased our borrowing capacity by $200.0 million through the addition of a $200.0 million term loan to the Credit Facility. The First Amendment also made certain other changes to the Credit Facility as described in Note 10-Long-Term Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d. Additionally, we incurred additional loan fees of $2.1 million.\nWe drew upon our Credit Facility to fund the ITG acquisition and subsequently had a net payment on our credit facility of $104.7 million from operating cash flows. The improvement in cash flow from operations was primarily driven by the timing of client billings and collections of our disaster relief and rebuild contracts as well as the unexpected acceleration of billing and collections for media buys. However, the timing of cash flow from disaster relief and rebuild efforts is more uncertain than from other clients due to factors such as political complexities and challenges among involved government agencies. Moreover, the billing processes have complex reporting requirements and the funding processes have been slow to distribute funds once billed.\nShort-term liquidity requirements are created by our use of funds for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings. Our primary source of borrowings is from our Credit Facility, as described in Note 10-Long-Term Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel COVID-19 virus as a global pandemic. There is significant uncertainty as to effects of this pandemic on the global economy, which in turn may impact, among other things, our ability to generate historical levels of positive cash flows from operations and our ability to successfully execute and fund key initiatives. However, our current belief is that the combination of internally generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, customary capital expenditures and acquisitions, quarterly cash dividends, share repurchases and organic growth. Additionally, we continuously analyze our capital structure to ensure we have capital to fund future strategic acquisitions. We monitor the state of the financial markets on a regular basis to assess the availability and cost of additional capital resources from both debt and equity sources. We believe that we will be able to access these markets at commercially reasonable terms and conditions if, in the future, we need additional borrowings or capital.\nFinancial Condition. There were several changes in our balance sheet during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. The more significant changes are discussed below.\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $13.8 million on December 31, 2020, from $6.5 million on December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had restricted cash of $68.1 million, all of which was classified as a current asset. These balances and the changes to the balances of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are further discussed in Cash Flow\u201d below and discussed in Note 3-Restricted Cash\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nContract receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, decreased to $222.9 million on December 31, 2020 compared to $261.2 million on December 31, 2019, primarily due to significant collection of outstanding receivables and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, primarily related to two clients filing for bankruptcy. Contract receivables are a significant component of our working capital and generally increase due to revenue growth and may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by our collection efforts, including timing from new contract startups, and other short-term fluctuations related to the payment practices of our clients. Contract assets and contract liabilities represent revenue in excess of billings and billings in excess of revenue, respectively, both of which generally arise from revenue recognition timing and contractually stipulated billing schedules or billing complexity. As of December 31, 2020, contract assets and contract liabilities were $143.4 million and $42.1 million, respectively, compared to $142.3 million and $37.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nWe evaluate our collections efforts using the days-sales-outstanding ratio ( DSO\u201d), which we calculate by dividing total accounts receivable (contract receivables, net and contract assets, less contract liabilities) by revenue per day for the trailing three months period. Days-sales-outstanding decreased to 67 days compared to 83 days during the prior year primarily due to significant collection efforts of our disaster relief and rebuilding contracts as well as accelerated collections related to media buys. The DSO, excluding disaster relief and rebuilding efforts, was 60 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to 71 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, as discussed in Note 6-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d and Note 16 - Business Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d, increased due to the acquisition of ITG and the impact of foreign currency translation. On January 31, 2020, we acquired ITG, for the purchase price of $255.0 million. The acquisition resulted in the recording of $188.3 million in goodwill and $47.3 million in intangible assets.\nOperating lease - right-of-use assets decreased from $134.0 million as of December 31, 2019 to $127.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and the operating lease liability, both current and long-term, decreased from $151.8 million at December 31, 2019 to $139.0 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the right-of-use assets is due to $32.3 of amortization, $3.1 million of impairment, and $2.0 million reduction resulting from modification/contractual termination of leases, offset by $29.8 million of right-of-use assets under new leases and foreign currency impact of $0.7 million. The decrease in the operating lease liability is due to principal payments of $41.0 million, $12.5 million of additional pre-payment of lease commitments in December 2020, and a $1.6 million reduction resulting from modification/contractual termination of leases, offset by additional lease liabilities under new leases.\nThe increase in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are primarily due to the lease acquired as part of the ITG acquisition and new facilities in Chicago. In the fourth quarter of 2020, management reviewed our operating lease facilities and, as a result of the review, we took a $4.9 million charge for both the contractual termination of 13 leases and the impairment of 3 leases for our discontinued use of the properties. The $4.9 million charge included $3.1 million in impairment, $1.5 million in termination fees, and $0.3 million in losses on the disposition of related fixed assets and other costs. The 13 terminated leases had lease end dates ranging from December 2020 to September 2024.\nLong-term debt increased to $313.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $164.3 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to financing of our $255 million acquisition of ITG partially offset by the net payments on our Credit Facility of $104.7 million. The average debt balance on the Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $428.0 million and $268.6 million, respectively. The average interest rate on the Credit Facility, excluding any fees and unamortized debt issuance costs, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 2.4% and 3.6%, respectively. We generally utilize cash flow from operations as our primary source of funding and turn to our Credit Facility to fund any temporary fluctuations, such as increases in contract receivables, reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses, purchase of treasury stock, payment of declared dividends, additional capital expenditures, and to meet funding requirements for new acquisitions.\nOn February 20, 2020, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement (the Swap\u201d) for a notional amount of $100.0 million in order to hedge a portion of the Company's floating rate Credit Facility. Similar to the previous swap agreements that the Company has entered into, this Swap is intended to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional amount hedged totaled $200.0 million, excluding the hedge sold on December 1, 2016, and were valued at an unrealized loss of $10.9 million, before tax, and are included in other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 12-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nOther long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2020 consists primarily of $17.3 million of deferred compensation plan liabilities, $10.0 million of the long-term portion of the deferred Company social security taxes under the CARES Act, $7.2 million of liabilities related to the long-term portion of fair value of outstanding hedges, and outstanding commitments under an acquisition agreement of $1.2 million.\nThe increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2.0 million, net of taxes, was driven by a change of $5.2 million in the fair value of the interest rate hedging instruments, $0.5 million in gains reclassified to income related to hedging instruments previously sold and offset by a $3.7 million change in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (primarily the British Pound, Euro and Canadian dollar. See Note 14-Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nWe have explored various options of mitigating the risk associated with potential fluctuations in the foreign currencies in which we conduct transactions. We currently have hedges in an amount proportionate to work anticipated to be performed under certain contracts in Europe. We recognize changes in the fair-value of the hedges in our results of operations. We may increase the number, size and scope of our hedges as we analyze options for mitigating our foreign exchange and interest rate risk. The current impact of the foreign currency hedges to the consolidated financial statements is immaterial.\nShare Repurchase Program. The objective of the share repurchase program has been to offset dilution resulting from employee stock compensation. The Company meets its objective to offset dilution via its 10b5-1 and 10b-18 trading plans. In September 2017 the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes share repurchases in the aggregate up to $100.0 million. Our total repurchases are also limited by the Credit Facility as described in Note 18-Share Repurchase Program\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d. Our overall repurchase limit is the lower of the amount imposed by our board of directors and by the Credit Facility. Previously, purchases under the repurchase program could be made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), and in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. On March 13, 2020, we terminated the Rule 105b-1 element of the share repurchase program. We subsequently approved an updated Rule 10b5-1 plan element of the share repurchase program, as part of its normal process, that is scheduled to commence January 2021. The purchases will be funded from existing cash balances and/or borrowings, and the repurchased shares will be held in treasury and used for general corporate purposes. The timing and extent to which we repurchase our shares will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations, as may be considered in our sole discretion. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 278,582 shares under this program at an average price of $78.66 per share. As of December 31, 2020, $46.1 million remained available for share repurchases under the share repurchase program.\nDividends. Cash dividends declared in 2020 were as follows:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> Dividend Declaration Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dividend Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> February 27, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 27, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 13, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 5, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 12, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 14, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 4, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 11, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 13, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 5, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 11, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 12, 2021\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows.

We bill most of our clients on a monthly basis after services are rendered.\nOperating activities provided $173.1 million in cash for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $91.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash flows provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily due to strong collections of contract receivables related to disaster relief and rebuilding efforts as well as accelerated collections related to our media placements work for which the associated media spend will occur in early 2021. Additionally, we were able to defer employer social security tax liabilities, under the CARES Act, until 2021 and 2022. The increases in cash flows were partially offset by the reduction in net income and the use of cash to settle outstanding operating liabilities. The improved collections of contract receivables is evidenced by the reduction in our DSO from 83 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to 67 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The reduction in our DSO was primarily the result of an 11 day decrease due to the accelerated collection related to media placements.\nInvesting activities used cash of $270.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our cash flows used in investing activities consists primarily of\ncapital expenditures and acquisitions. The cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 included acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $253.3 million, of which $253.1 million was for ITG and $0.2 million was for Eco-Tech, and $17.7 million for capital expenditures. The cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $26.9 million for capital expenditures and acquisitions of $3.6 million.\nOur cash flows used in financing activities consists primarily of debt and equity transactions. For the year ended 2020, cash flows used in financing activities were primarily due to the net advance from our Credit Facility of $150.3 million, net receipt and payments of restricted contract funds of $65.6 million, dividend payments of $10.6 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan and shares purchased from employees to pay required withholding taxes related to settlement of restricted stock units of $29.7 million. For the year ended 2019, cash flows used in financing activities were primarily due to net payments on our Credit Facility of $35.0 million, dividend payments of $10.5 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan and shares purchased from employees to pay required withholding taxes related to settlement of restricted stock units of $23.4 million.\nUnder a contract with a customer commencing in the final quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company receives advance payments to be used to pay providers of services to the customer, a separate third-party. The advanced payments are treated as restricted cash as the Company is required under the contract to distribute the advanced funds to the third-party providers or return the advanced funds to the customer. Because the Company receives the advance payments from a customer, which must be refunded to the customer or remitted to a third party, the cash receipts are treated as borrowings rather than receipts for the provision of goods or services. Therefore, these cash receipts are presented as financing cash inflows, Receipt of restricted contract funds\u201d, with the subsequent payments classified as financing cash outflows, Payment of restricted cash contract funds.\u201d\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe had ten outstanding letters of credit provided for under our Credit Facility with a total value of $2.7 million, primarily related to deposits to support our facility leases.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 that require us to make future cash payments.

recognition entails the use of significant judgment, including, but not limited to, the following: evaluating agreements in terms of the number and nature of performance obligations; determining the appropriate method for measuring progress of the satisfaction of obligations; and preparing estimates in terms of the amount of progress that we have made. Most of our revenue is recognized over time and for many fixed-price contracts, in particular, we estimate the proportion of total revenue earned using the ratio of contract costs incurred to total estimated contract costs, which requires us to prepare estimates as work progresses of contract cost left to be incurred. Moreover, some of our contracts include variable consideration, which requires us to estimate the most likely amounts that will be earned over the respective contractually stipulated performance assessment periods. For these obligations, changes in estimates result in cumulative catch-up adjustments and may have a significant impact on earnings during a given period.\n \u2022 Number of billable days in a quarter; \n (2) Operating lease obligations include leases of facilities and equipment.

Our USAID-cognizant indirect cost rates have been finalized through December 31, 2014, and its NIH-cognizant cost rates have been finalized through December 31, 2011. Contract revenue have been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final audit and cost settlement and we do not believe any additional, material revenue adjustments will result from finalizing the indirect rates and closing open audit years.\nWe are required to adjust stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. We estimate the rate of future forfeitures based on factors which include our historical experience, but the amount of actual forfeitures may differ from current estimates particularly if the rate of future forfeitures is different from previous experience. In addition, the estimation of PSAs that will ultimately vest requires judgment in terms of estimates of future performance. To the extent actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures and actual performance or updated performance estimates differ from current estimates, such expense amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates are revised.

The higher interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was due to higher average debt balances, primarily due to the financing of the ITG acquisition, partially offset by lower average interest rates for the period ended December 31, 2020 compared to the period ended December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 Timing of receipt of invoices from, and payments to, employees and vendors; \nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time-and-materials\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 749,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 700,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 581,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed-price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 529,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 566,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 526,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost-based\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 227,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 229,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,506,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,478,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,337,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (6) Adjustments related to bad debt reserve: During 2018, we established a bad debt reserve for amounts due from a utility client that had filed for bankruptcy and included the reserve as an adjustment due to its relative size.

To protect employee health and safety while COVID-19 remains a threat, we plan to continue to deliver a majority of our services to clients remotely for the foreseeable future and continue to evaluate our return to office plans. While the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act contains a provision that allows federal contractors to seek specified reimbursement for certain employees who are unable to perform their contract requirements due to government restrictions, we believe we have limited claims under the CARES Act, and reimbursements are also subject to limitations and do not extend past December 31, 2020. Additionally, we exercised the option to defer payment of the employer portion of the Social Security tax, with 50% to be repaid by December 31, 2021 and the remainder by December 31, 2022. We deferred payment of approximately $20.9 million of employer Social Security taxes during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\ncapital expenditures and acquisitions. The cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 included acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $253.3 million, of which $253.1 million was for ITG and $0.2 million was for Eco-Tech, and $17.7 million for capital expenditures. The cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $26.9 million for capital expenditures and acquisitions of $3.6 million.\nUnder a contract with a customer commencing in the final quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company receives advance payments to be used to pay providers of services to the customer, a separate third-party. The advanced payments are treated as restricted cash as the Company is required under the contract to distribute the advanced funds to the third-party providers or return the advanced funds to the customer. Because the Company receives the advance payments from a customer, which must be refunded to the customer or remitted to a third party, the cash receipts are treated as borrowings rather than receipts for the provision of goods or services. Therefore, these cash receipts are presented as financing cash inflows, Receipt of restricted contract funds\u201d, with the subsequent payments classified as financing cash outflows, Payment of restricted cash contract funds.\u201d\nCash Flows. We consider cash on deposit and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. The following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash for the following years.\nWhen a performance obligation is billed using a time-and-materials contract type, we use the right to invoice practical expedient output progress measures to estimate revenue earned based on hours worked in contract performance at negotiated billing rates. Fixed-price level-of-effort contracts are substantially similar to time-and-materials contracts except that we are required to deliver a specified level of effort over a stated period of time. For these contracts, we estimate revenue earned using contract hours worked at negotiated bill rates as we deliver the contractually required workforce.\nWe also evaluate whether two or more agreements should be accounted for as one single contract and whether combined or single agreements should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. For most contracts, the client requires that we perform a number of tasks in providing an integrated output and, hence, each of these contracts is tracked as having only one performance obligation. When contracts are separated into multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised services underlying each performance obligation. We generally provide customized solutions in which the pricing is based on specific negotiations with each client, and, in these cases, we use a cost-plus margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. It is common for our long-term contracts to contain award fees, incentive fees or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts are generally awarded at the completion of a prescribed performance assessment period based on the achievement of performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, and the amount awarded may be subject to client discretion. Variable consideration is estimated based on the most likely amount. Estimates of variable consideration will be constrained only to the extent that it is probable that significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nClient markets\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $13.8 million on December 31, 2020, from $6.5 million on December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had restricted cash of $68.1 million, all of which was classified as a current asset. These balances and the changes to the balances of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are further discussed in Cash Flow\u201d below and discussed in Note 3-Restricted Cash\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. federal government\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 666,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 560,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 546,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. state and local government\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 222,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 279,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 183,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International government\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 985,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 962,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 852,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 521,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 515,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 485,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,506,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,478,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,337,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe had ten outstanding letters of credit provided for under our Credit Facility with a total value of $2.7 million, primarily related to deposits to support our facility leases.\nOur discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses during the reporting period and our application of critical accounting policies, including: revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. If any of these estimates or judgments prove to be incorrect, our reported results could be materially affected. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting practices described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and, therefore, consider them to be critical accounting policies. Significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies listed below, are more fully described and discussed in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nOperating lease - right-of-use assets decreased from $134.0 million as of December 31, 2019 to $127.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and the operating lease liability, both current and long-term, decreased from $151.8 million at December 31, 2019 to $139.0 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the right-of-use assets is due to $32.3 of amortization, $3.1 million of impairment, and $2.0 million reduction resulting from modification/contractual termination of leases, offset by $29.8 million of right-of-use assets under new leases and foreign currency impact of $0.7 million. The decrease in the operating lease liability is due to principal payments of $41.0 million, $12.5 million of additional pre-payment of lease commitments in December 2020, and a $1.6 million reduction resulting from modification/contractual termination of leases, offset by additional lease liabilities under new leases.\nWe provide professional services and technology-based solutions to government and commercial clients. Our services include management, marketing, technology, and policy consulting, and implementation services. We help our clients conceive, develop, implement, and improve solutions that address complex business, natural resource, social, technological, and public safety issues. Our services primarily support clients that operate in four key markets:\nAdjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations. We evaluate these adjustments on an individual basis based on both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including their size and nature, as well as whether or not we expect them to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We believe that the adjustments applied in calculating adjusted EBITDA are reasonable and appropriate to provide additional information to investors.\nOur operating cash flows are primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts, our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner, and the timing of vendor and subcontractor payments in accordance with negotiated payment terms. We bill most of our clients on a monthly basis after services are rendered.\nShort-term liquidity requirements are created by our use of funds for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings. Our primary source of borrowings is from our Credit Facility, as described in Note 10-Long-Term Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n\nContract mix\n</table>\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nFor performance obligations requiring the delivery of a service for a fixed price, we use the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs, provided that costs incurred (an input method) represents a reasonable measure of progress towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation, in order to estimate the portion of total revenue earned. This method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of value to the client when we are satisfying a performance obligation that entails integration of tasks for a combined output, which requires us to coordinate the work of employees, subcontractors and delivery of other contract costs. Contract costs that are not reflective of our progress toward satisfying a performance obligation are not included in the calculation of the measure of progress. When this method is used, changes in estimated costs to complete these obligations result in adjustments to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis, which causes the effect of revised estimates for prior periods to be recognized in the current period. Changes in these estimates can routinely occur over contract performance for a variety of reasons, which include: changes in contract scope; changes in contract cost estimates due to unanticipated cost growth or reassessments of risks impacting costs; changes in estimated incentive or award fees; or performing better or worse than previously estimated.\n\u2022 Engagement Services.\n (1) Income tax effects were calculated using an effective U.S. GAAP tax rate of 26.4%, 23.6% and 25.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nClient type\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSELECTED KEY METRICS\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel COVID-19 virus as a global pandemic. There is significant uncertainty as to effects of this pandemic on the global economy, which in turn may impact, among other things, our ability to generate historical levels of positive cash flows from operations and our ability to successfully execute and fund key initiatives. However, our current belief is that the combination of internally generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, customary capital expenditures and acquisitions, quarterly cash dividends, share repurchases and organic growth. Additionally, we continuously analyze our capital structure to ensure we have capital to fund future strategic acquisitions. We monitor the state of the financial markets on a regular basis to assess the availability and cost of additional capital resources from both debt and equity sources. We believe that we will be able to access these markets at commercially reasonable terms and conditions if, in the future, we need additional borrowings or capital.\nThe ICF International, Inc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended, (the 2018 Omnibus Plan\u201d) provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, and other stock-based awards to all officers, key employees, and non-employee directors. The 2018 Omnibus Plan replaced the previous 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Prior Plan\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 1,107,968 shares available for grant under the 2018 Omnibus Plan.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel strain of coronavirus disease COVID-19 as a global pandemic. There continues to be significant uncertainty as to the effects of this pandemic on the global economy, which may impact, among other things, our operations, balance sheet, results of operations or cash flows. Adverse events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel, the potential impact on our employees, clients, subcontractors and other suppliers and business partners, a slow-down in customer decision-making that affects procurement cycles, a reprioritization of client spending, and other matters affecting the general work and business environment have harmed, and could continue to harm, our business and delay the implementation of our business strategy. We cannot fully anticipate all the ways in which the current global health crisis, economic slowdown and financial market conditions will adversely impact our business in the future. The longer the duration of the pandemic, the advent of new strains of the virus and challenges faced in the rollout of vaccines, the more likely it is that it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe following table shows the approximate percentage of our revenue for each of these types of contracts for the periods indicated. Certain immaterial revenue amounts in the prior years have been reclassified due to minor adjustments and reclassification within contract type.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe report operating results and financial data as a single segment based on the consolidated information used by our chief operating decision-maker in evaluating the financial performance of our business and allocating resources. Our single segment represents our core business: professional services for government and commercial clients. Although we describe our multiple service offerings to clients that operate in four markets to provide a better understanding of the scope and scale of our business, we do not manage our business or allocate our resources based on those service offerings or client markets. Rather, on a project-by-project basis, we assemble the best team from throughout the enterprise to deliver highly customized solutions that are tailored to meet the needs of each client.\nContract receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, decreased to $222.9 million on December 31, 2020 compared to $261.2 million on December 31, 2019, primarily due to significant collection of outstanding receivables and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, primarily related to two clients filing for bankruptcy. Contract receivables are a significant component of our working capital and generally increase due to revenue growth and may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by our collection efforts, including timing from new contract startups, and other short-term fluctuations related to the payment practices of our clients. Contract assets and contract liabilities represent revenue in excess of billings and billings in excess of revenue, respectively, both of which generally arise from revenue recognition timing and contractually stipulated billing schedules or billing complexity. As of December 31, 2020, contract assets and contract liabilities were $143.4 million and $42.1 million, respectively, compared to $142.3 million and $37.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nAs part of management actions to counter the impact of COVID-19, we continue to align our costs with anticipated revenues. In the U.S. and in our international operations, we have used staff reductions, furloughs, and other temporary wage reduction programs in response to the pandemic. We incurred $2.1 million in severance costs related to unanticipated terminations associated with COVID-19. We are currently participating in several international government subsidy programs, providing approximately $3.0 million as of December 31, 2020, whose objective is to encourage eligible companies to keep employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. A requirement of these subsidies is that we continue to employ the identified employees who might otherwise have been impacted by a reaction to COVID-19. The subsidies are limited in the amount and time in which payroll costs are covered.\nRevenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $1,506.9 million, compared to $1,478.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $28.4 million or 1.9%. The increase in revenue was attributable to an increase in governmental revenue of $22.5 million, or 2.3%, and an increase in commercial revenue of $5.8 million, or 1.1%, compared to the prior year. The changes in government revenue by client type were driven by the increase in federal government revenue, including clients from the ITG acquisition, offset by a decrease in state and local government revenue, from our disaster recovery clients, and a decrease in international government revenue. The increase in our commercial revenue by client market was driven by increases in revenue from energy, environment and infrastructure clients and health, education, and social program clients, including clients from our ITG acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in marketing services provided to our consumer and financial clients, which have been impacted by COVID-19, compared to the prior year. The governmental and commercial revenues as a percent of total revenue remained consistent at 65% and 35% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with 65% and 35% for the prior year.\n \u2022 Commencement, completion, and termination of contracts; \nIndirect and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $411.6 million compared to $395.8 million for the prior year, an increase of $15.8 million or 4.0%. The increase in indirect and selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in indirect labor, associated fringe costs, and other compensation costs of $25.6 million, and a decrease in general and administrative costs of $9.8 million. The increase in indirect labor, associated fringe costs, and other compensation costs is due to the general increase in labor year over year and additional severance costs from our internal restructuring and $8.8 million expense related to obligations under the Executive Chair's employment agreement. The decrease in general and administrative costs was due to a reduction of travel-related expenses of $10.3 million, a decrease related to the $1.7 million impairment of intangible assets in the prior year, a decrease in our use of contract labor in the current year, and the decline in non-labor related administrative costs in the current year, offset by increases in the current year of $4.4 million of expenses related to the termination, abandonment, or impairment of several operating leases, a $3.4 million increase in bad debt expenses, and other increased costs due to our investments in our internal infrastructure and processes, and professional fees and insurance costs associated with our acquisition activities. Indirect and selling expenses as a percent of revenue increased to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 26.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in indirect and selling expenses as a percent of revenue is due to expenses in 2020 related to termination of operating leases and expenses related to the departing officer's employment in our indirect and selling expenses for the year ending December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Borrowing Capacity. On March 3, 2020, we entered into the First Amendment (the First Amendment\u201d) to the Fifth Amended and Restated Business Loan and Security Agreement with a group of 10 lenders (the Credit Facility\u201d). The First Amendment amended the Fifth Amended and Restated Business Loan and Security Agreement, entered on May 17, 2017. As a result of the First Amendment, we increased our borrowing capacity by $200.0 million through the addition of a $200.0 million term loan to the Credit Facility. The First Amendment also made certain other changes to the Credit Facility as described in Note 10-Long-Term Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d. Additionally, we incurred additional loan fees of $2.1 million.\nContract receivables, net - This account includes amounts billed or billable under contract terms. The amounts due are stated at their net realizable value. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected. We consider a number of factors in our estimate of the allowance, including knowledge of a client's financial condition, its historical collection experience, and other factors relevant to assessing the collectability of the receivables.\n\nFor the purpose of performing the annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2020, as our business is highly integrated and all of our components have similar economic characteristics, we have concluded we have one aggregated reporting unit at a consolidated entity level. We assess goodwill at the reporting level. For the goodwill impairment test, we opted to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, we may conclude that no impairment exists. If we conclude otherwise, a goodwill impairment test must be performed, which includes a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognizing, as an impairment loss, the difference of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying amount.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13.3 million compared to $8.1 million for the prior year. The $5.3 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of additional intangible assets related to the ITG acquisition totaling $47.3 million, partially offset by reduced levels of amortization of intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions.\nWe evaluate our collections efforts using the days-sales-outstanding ratio ( DSO\u201d), which we calculate by dividing total accounts receivable (contract receivables, net and contract assets, less contract liabilities) by revenue per day for the trailing three months period. Days-sales-outstanding decreased to 67 days compared to 83 days during the prior year primarily due to significant collection efforts of our disaster relief and rebuilding contracts as well as accelerated collections related to media buys. The DSO, excluding disaster relief and rebuilding efforts, was 60 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to 71 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.\nOur cash flows used in financing activities consists primarily of debt and equity transactions. For the year ended 2020, cash flows used in financing activities were primarily due to the net advance from our Credit Facility of $150.3 million, net receipt and payments of restricted contract funds of $65.6 million, dividend payments of $10.6 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan and shares purchased from employees to pay required withholding taxes related to settlement of restricted stock units of $29.7 million. For the year ended 2019, cash flows used in financing activities were primarily due to net payments on our Credit Facility of $35.0 million, dividend payments of $10.5 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan and shares purchased from employees to pay required withholding taxes related to settlement of restricted stock units of $23.4 million.\nNotwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, we believe that, in the long-term, demand for our services will continue to grow as government, industry, and other stakeholders seek to address critical long-term societal and natural resource issues due to heightened concerns about clean energy and energy efficiency; health promotion, treatment, and cost control; natural disaster relief and rebuild efforts; and ongoing homeland security threats. In the wake of the major hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, Maria, Laura and Michael) that devastated communities in Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, the affected areas remain in various stages of relief and recovery efforts. We believe our prior and current experience with disaster relief and rebuild efforts, including those from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and Superstorm Sandy, put us in a favorable position to continue to provide recovery and housing assistance, and environmental and infrastructure solutions on behalf of federal departments and agencies, state, territorial and local jurisdictions, and regional agencies.\nEco-Tech Consultants, Inc. - In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Eco-Tech, an ecological consulting firm located in Louisville, Kentucky. The firm provides a range of ecological services across the Eastern United States and will greatly increase our capacity to support a growing portfolio of transportation agency clients in the Eastern United States.\nThe following table shows revenue generated from client markets as a percent of total revenue for the periods indicated. For each client, we have attributed all revenue from that client to the market we consider to be the client's primary market, even if a portion of that revenue relates to a different market. Certain minor revenue amounts reported in the prior years have been reclassified within key market categories based on our current view of the client's primary market in order to increase comparability of the current year to prior years.\n \u2022 Timing of client orders; \nThe increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2.0 million, net of taxes, was driven by a change of $5.2 million in the fair value of the interest rate hedging instruments, $0.5 million in gains reclassified to income related to hedging instruments previously sold and offset by a $3.7 million change in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (primarily the British Pound, Euro and Canadian dollar. See Note 14-Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\n\u2022 Health, Education, and Social Programs;\nThe purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over such lives and reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators arise. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill and intangibles assets were $909.9 million and $59.9 million, respectively.\nLong-term contracts typically contain billing terms that provide for invoicing monthly or upon completion of milestones and payment on a net 30-day basis. Exceptions to monthly billing terms are to ensure that we perform satisfactorily rather than representing a significant financing component. For cost-based contracts, our performance is evaluated during a contractually stipulated performance period and, while contract costs may be billed on a monthly basis, we are generally permitted to bill for incentive or award fees only after the completion of the performance assessment period, which may occur quarterly, semi-annually or annually, and after the client completes the performance assessment. Fixed-price contracts may provide for milestone billings based on the attainment of specific project objectives and, since they are tied to our project performance, these type of billing terms do not represent a significant financing component. Moreover, contracts may require retentions or hold backs that are paid at the end of the contract to ensure that we perform in accordance with requirements which do not represent our providing financing to our clients but rather are a means to ensure that we meet contract requirements. We do not assess whether a contract contains a significant financing component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between payment by the client and the transfer of promised services to the client will be one year or less.\n (3) Special charges related to severance for staff realignment: These costs are mainly due to involuntary employee termination benefits for Company officers, groups of employees who have been terminated as part of a consolidation or reorganization or, to the extent that the costs are not included in the previous two categories, involuntary employee termination benefits for employees who have been terminated as a result of COVID-19. \nA key element of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions. In 2018, we acquired The Future Customer ( TFC\u201d), DMS Disaster Consultants ( DMS\u201d), and We Are Vista Limited ( Vista\u201d). In January 2020 and December 2020, we completed the acquisitions of ITG and Eco-Tech Consultants, Inc. ( Eco-Tech\u201d). While providing capabilities and access to new clients in support of our growth strategy, these acquisitions were not significant to our financial statements taken as a whole.\nWe primarily provide services and technology-based solutions for clients that operate in a variety of markets and the solutions may span the entire program life cycle, from initial research and analysis to the design and implementation of solutions. We enter into agreements with clients that create enforceable rights and obligations and for which it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we will be entitled as services and solutions are transferred to the client. Except in certain narrowly defined situations, our agreements with our clients are written and revenue is generally not recognized on oral or implied arrangements. We recognize revenue based on the consideration specified in the applicable agreement and exclude from revenue amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Accordingly, sales and similar taxes which are collected for third parties are excluded from the transaction price.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate our ability to benefit from all deferred tax assets and establish valuation allowances for amounts we believe are not more likely than not to be realized.\n\n \u2022 Changes in staff utilization; \nWe are primarily a service business, and our staffing, and that of our subcontractors, has been maintained, substantially on a work from home basis, fortunately with little COVID-19 illness among our staff. To date we have experienced continuity in the majority of our work for our government clients, which accounted for approximately 65% of our revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There have been postponements of events and challenges around some project work requiring travel, but overall, our government clients have continued to require our services. We are unable to predict whether, and to what extent, this trend will continue. It would be reasonable to expect that some deterioration of certain client activities has occurred and will continue to occur due to COVID-19, but there is also the possibility of additional demand from federal agencies such as the CDC, HHS, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as state and local and international government agencies.\n\u2022 Analytics Services;\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be used as alternatives to net income as a measure of operating performance. This presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may use different methods to prepare similarly titled measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management's discretionary use as these measures do not include certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, capital expenditures and debt service.\nInvesting activities used cash of $270.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our cash flows used in investing activities consists primarily of\nThe increase in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are primarily due to the lease acquired as part of the ITG acquisition and new facilities in Chicago. In the fourth quarter of 2020, management reviewed our operating lease facilities and, as a result of the review, we took a $4.9 million charge for both the contractual termination of 13 leases and the impairment of 3 leases for our discontinued use of the properties. The $4.9 million charge included $3.1 million in impairment, $1.5 million in termination fees, and $0.3 million in losses on the disposition of related fixed assets and other costs. The 13 terminated leases had lease end dates ranging from December 2020 to September 2024.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n (4) Special charges related to facilities consolidations, office closures, and our future corporate headquarters: These costs are exit costs associated with terminated leases or full office closures. The exit costs include charges incurred under a contractual obligation that existed as of the date of the accrual and for which we will (i) continue to pay until the contractual obligation is satisfied but with no economic benefit to us or (ii) we contractually terminated the obligation and ceased utilizing the facilities. Additionally, we incurred one-time charges with respect to the execution of a new lease agreement for our corporate headquarters. \nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n \u2022 Timing of events related to discrete tax items; \n \u2022 Additions to, and departures of, staff; \n \u2022 Timing of award fee notices; \nDirect costs. Direct costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $972.4 million compared to $953.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $19.2 million or 2.0%. The increase in direct costs and associated fringe costs was attributable to an increase of $31.6 million in direct labor and associated fringe benefits costs offset by a $12.4 million decrease in subcontractor and other direct costs. The direct labor and associated fringe costs increase is the result of an increase in our federal government revenues, as discussed above, partially offset by the decline in direct labor in our international government clients and our commercial clients. The decrease in subcontractor and other direct costs is due to the decline in other direct costs of $12.0 million, primarily travel related costs offset by an increase in media buys, and a $0.4 million decline in subcontractor costs. The decline in subcontractor costs is due to the decline in revenue from contracts that are reliant upon subcontractors, such as the hurricane relief and recovery efforts and marketing services, offset by subcontractor costs from the ITG acquisition. Direct costs as a percent of revenue remained constant at 64.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe Are Vista Limited - In October 2018, we acquired Vista, a communications company headquartered in Leeds, U.K., with an additional presence in London. Vista provides advisory services and solutions to clients in the financial, retail, automobile, and energy industries and broadens our capabilities in the region.\nPayments to us on cost-based contracts with the federal government are provisional payments subject to adjustment upon audit by the government. Such audits have been finalized through 2011 for NIH-cognizant indirect rates and through 2014 for USAID-cognizant indirect rates, and any adjustments have been immaterial. Contract revenue for subsequent periods has been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized on final audit and settlement of costs in those years.\nIn some fixed price service contracts, we perform services of a recurring nature, such as maintenance and other services of a stand ready\u201d nature. For these contracts, we have the right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value that the client has received. Therefore, we record revenue on a time-elapsed basis to reflect the transfer of control to the client throughout the contract.\nWe recognized total compensation expense relating to stock-based compensation of $24.6 million, $26.0 million, and $19.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock awards, and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We treat CSRSUs as liability-classified awards, and account for them at fair value based on the closing price of our stock at the balance sheet date. We recognize expense for performance-based share awards ( PSAs\u201d), which are subject to a performance condition and a market condition, on a straight-line basis over the performance period. Non-employee director awards are expensed over the performance period.\nContract mix varies from year to year due to numerous factors, including our business strategies and the procurement activities of our clients. Unless the context requires otherwise, we use the term contracts\u201d to refer to contracts and any task orders or delivery orders issued under a contract. There are three main types of contracts: time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, and cost-based contracts. For a detailed discussion of contract types, see Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition\u201d above.\nService Revenue\nOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK\nWe began granting awards of registered shares to our non-employee directors on an annual basis under the 2018 Omnibus Plan in the third quarter of 2018. Previously, under the Prior Plan, we granted awards of unregistered shares to the directors under the Annual Equity Election program. Those awards were issued from treasury stock and had no impact on the shares available for grant under the Prior Plan.\nStock-based Compensation\n \u2022 Paid time off taken by our employees; \nContract liabilities - This account consists of advance payments received and billings in excess of revenue recognized on contracts. Contract liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis each period even though individual contracts may contain multiple performance obligations.\nIMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nWe drew upon our Credit Facility to fund the ITG acquisition and subsequently had a net payment on our credit facility of $104.7 million from operating cash flows. The improvement in cash flow from operations was primarily driven by the timing of client billings and collections of our disaster relief and rebuild contracts as well as the unexpected acceleration of billing and collections for media buys. However, the timing of cash flow from disaster relief and rebuild efforts is more uncertain than from other clients due to factors such as political complexities and challenges among involved government agencies. Moreover, the billing processes have complex reporting requirements and the funding processes have been slow to distribute funds once billed.\nOperating income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, operating income was $89.1 million compared to $101.4 million for the prior year, a decrease of $12.3 million or 12.1%. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 5.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 6.9% for the prior year. The changes were largely due to an increase in indirect and selling expenses, associated with expense related to obligations under the Executive Chair's employment agreement, and an increase in amortization of intangible assets partially offset by higher revenues.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn order to evaluate operations, we track revenue by key metrics that provide useful information about the nature of our operations. Client markets provide insight into the breadth of our expertise. Client type is an indicator of the diversity of our client base. Revenue by contract mix provides insight in terms of the degree of performance risk that we have assumed. Significant variances in the key metrics tables that are provided below are discussed under the revenue section of the results of operations.\nFinancial Condition. There were several changes in our balance sheet during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. The more significant changes are discussed below.\nOf the remaining 35% of our total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the majority was generated from commercial energy markets and commercial marketing services, each of which represented roughly half of that total. In commercial energy, where we work primarily for utility clients, we have experienced trends similar to those with our government clients, although some aspects of energy efficiency programs have been put on hold as they involve direct interaction with consumers. In our commercial marketing services, a key component of our business is our industry-leading loyalty platform, where we have long-term implementation contracts, and we believe our clients, many of which are in the hospitality space, will continue to stay engaged with their most loyal customers. The other parts of commercial marketing services, which include public event management and marketing technology, were impacted based on the restriction upon travel worldwide and the deferral or cancellation of marketing events. Some of these commercial clients perform work in travel-related markets and have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we are monitoring that business area closely. These elements of commercial marketing services represented less than 16% of our total Company-wide revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nITEM 7.\n \u2022 Progress of contract performance; \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted EPS for the periods indicated:\n\n\nEarnings before interest and other income and/or expense, tax, and depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is a measure we use to evaluate operating performance. We believe EBITDA is useful in assessing ongoing trends and, as a result, may provide greater visibility in understanding our operations.\n\u2022 Digital Services; and\n (2) Special charges related to acquisitions: These costs consist primarily of consultants and other outside third-party costs, integration costs associated with an acquisition, and an adjustment to the contingent consideration liability from a previous acquisition. \nDMS Disaster Consultants - In August 2018, we acquired DMS, a disaster management and recovery firm based in Florida, to broaden our capabilities in support of assisting communities, businesses and individuals recover from man-made and nature disasters. DMS assists public sector clients with man-made and natural disaster planning and preparedness, and post-disaster response and recovery efforts by assisting clients in obtaining federal funding from Federal the Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), insurance companies, and other sources.\nIncentive Technology Group, LLC - In January 2020, we completed the acquisition of ITG, one of the leading providers of cloud-based platform services to the federal government. ITG provides solutions through the adoption of next generation technologies for federal government agencies, many of which are among our long-standing clients.\n (5) Special charges related to retirement of Executive Chair: These costs include severance, pro rata incentive bonus, welfare benefits, and acceleration of equity awards we incurred under the departing officer's severance agreement during the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result of the employment agreement, the departing officer was able to maintain certain equity awards beyond his date of employment. \n</td> </tr>\nDrawing from our domain knowledge and staff experience in working in multi-disciplinary teams for clients in a variety of markets, we provide services to our diverse client base that deliver value throughout the entire life cycle of a policy, program, project, or initiative. Our primary services include:\nOther expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expense was flat at $0.5 million compared to other expense of $0.5 million for the prior year.\nAs a service provider, we generally recognize revenue over time as control is transferred to a client, based on the extent of progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. The selection of the method used to measure progress requires judgment and, among other things, is dependent on the contract type selected by the client during contract negotiation and the nature of the services and solutions to be provided.\nWe also serve a variety of commercial clients worldwide, including: airlines, airports, electric and gas utilities, health care companies, banks and other financial services companies, transportation, travel and hospitality firms, non-profits/associations, manufacturing firms, retail chains, and distribution companies. Our commercial clients, which include clients outside the U.S., generated approximately 35%, 35%, and 36% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nStock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of these instruments and the estimated number of shares ultimately expected to vest. The calculation of the fair value of the awards requires certain inputs that are subjective and changes to the estimates used will cause the fair value of stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense to vary. The fair value of stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs, PSAs and non-employee director awards is estimated based on the fair value of a share of common stock at the grant date. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The fair value of a stock option award is affected by the price of our stock on the date of grant, as well as other assumptions used as inputs in the valuation model. These assumptions include the estimated volatility of the price of our stock over the term of the awards, the estimated period of time that we expect employees will hold stock options, and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of PSAs is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\nYears Ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share\n(dollars in thousands)\n (1) Adjustment related to impairment of long-lived assets: We recognized impairment expense of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to impairment of right-of-use lease assets and $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 related to an intangible asset associated with a historical business acquisition. \nIndirect and selling expenses. Indirect and selling expenses generally include our management, facilities, and infrastructure costs for all employees and the salaries and wages related to indirect activities, including stock-based and cash-based incentive compensation provided to employees whose compensation and other benefit costs are included in indirect and selling expenses, plus associated fringe benefits not directly related to client engagements.\nWe evaluate contractual arrangements to determine whether revenue should be recognized on a gross versus net basis. Our assessment is based on the nature of the promise to the client. In most cases, we agree to provide specified services to the client as a principal and revenue is recognized on a gross basis. In certain instances, we act as an agent and merely arrange for another party to provide services to the client and revenue is recognized on a net basis in reflection of the fact that we do not control the goods or services provided to the client by the other party.\n (1) Represents the obligation for principal and variable interest payments related to the Credit Facility assuming the principal amount outstanding and interest rates at December 31, 2020 remain fixed through maturity. These assumptions are subject to change in future periods. \n \u2022 Level and cost of our debt; \nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\n \u2022 Our contract mix and use of subcontractors or the timing of other direct costs for which we may earn lower contract margin; \n \u2022 Extraordinary economic events and natural disasters; \n \u2022 General market and economic conditions. \nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nProvision for income taxes. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, was 26.4% and 23.6%, respectively. Our effective tax rate, including state and foreign taxes net of federal benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, was higher than the statutory tax rate for the year primarily due to tax benefits for stock-based compensation, permanently non-taxable income and state tax credits, and partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, permanent differences related to compensation costs, and other expenses not deductible for tax purposes.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, as discussed in Note 6-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d and Note 16 - Business Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d, increased due to the acquisition of ITG and the impact of foreign currency translation. On January 31, 2020, we acquired ITG, for the purchase price of $255.0 million. The acquisition resulted in the recording of $188.3 million in goodwill and $47.3 million in intangible assets.\n\u2022 Consumer and Financial.\nNew accounting standards are discussed in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\n \u2022 Variations in purchasing patterns under our contracts; \nOur primary clients are the agencies and departments of the federal government and commercial clients. Most of our revenue is from contracts on which we are the prime contractor, which we believe provides us strong client relationships. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, approximately 92%, 92%, and 92% of our revenue, respectively, was from prime contracts.\n\nWe utilize cash settled RSUs ( CSRSUs\u201d) which are settled only in cash payments. The cash payment is calculated by multiplying the number of CSRSUs vested by our closing stock price on the vesting date, subject to a maximum payment cap and a minimum payment floor. CSRSUs have no impact on the shares available for grant under the 2018 Omnibus Plan and have no impact on the calculated shares used in EPS calculations.\nBecause a significant portion of our expenses (such as personnel, facilities, and related costs) are fixed in the short-term, contract performance and variation in the volume of activity, as well as in the number and volume of contracts commenced or completed during any year, may cause significant variations in operating results from year to year. We generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years, although we cannot ensure that we will be able to do so in the future.\n \u2022 Timing of billings to, and collection of payments from clients; \nDividends. Cash dividends declared in 2020 were as follows:\nShare Repurchase Program. The objective of the share repurchase program has been to offset dilution resulting from employee stock compensation. The Company meets its objective to offset dilution via its 10b5-1 and 10b-18 trading plans. In September 2017 the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes share repurchases in the aggregate up to $100.0 million. Our total repurchases are also limited by the Credit Facility as described in Note 18-Share Repurchase Program\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d. Our overall repurchase limit is the lower of the amount imposed by our board of directors and by the Credit Facility. Previously, purchases under the repurchase program could be made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), and in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. On March 13, 2020, we terminated the Rule 105b-1 element of the share repurchase program. We subsequently approved an updated Rule 10b5-1 plan element of the share repurchase program, as part of its normal process, that is scheduled to commence January 2021. The purchases will be funded from existing cash balances and/or borrowings, and the repurchased shares will be held in treasury and used for general corporate purposes. The timing and extent to which we repurchase our shares will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations, as may be considered in our sole discretion. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 278,582 shares under this program at an average price of $78.66 per share. As of December 31, 2020, $46.1 million remained available for share repurchases under the share repurchase program.\nLong-term debt increased to $313.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $164.3 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to financing of our $255 million acquisition of ITG partially offset by the net payments on our Credit Facility of $104.7 million. The average debt balance on the Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $428.0 million and $268.6 million, respectively. The average interest rate on the Credit Facility, excluding any fees and unamortized debt issuance costs, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 2.4% and 3.6%, respectively. We generally utilize cash flow from operations as our primary source of funding and turn to our Credit Facility to fund any temporary fluctuations, such as increases in contract receivables, reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses, purchase of treasury stock, payment of declared dividends, additional capital expenditures, and to meet funding requirements for new acquisitions.\n \u2022 Timing of significant costs and investments (such as bid and proposal costs and the costs involved in planning or making acquisitions); \n\nOn February 20, 2020, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement (the Swap\u201d) for a notional amount of $100.0 million in order to hedge a portion of the Company's floating rate Credit Facility. Similar to the previous swap agreements that the Company has entered into, this Swap is intended to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional amount hedged totaled $200.0 million, excluding the hedge sold on December 1, 2016, and were valued at an unrealized loss of $10.9 million, before tax, and are included in other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 12-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\n \u2022 Changes in accounting principles and policies; and/or \nContract assets - This account includes unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized on contracts when the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amounts billed. It also includes contract retainages until we have met the contract-stipulated requirements for payment. Contract assets are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis each period even though individual contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. On a contract-by-contract basis, amounts do not exceed their net realizable value.\nOur operating cycle for long-term contracts may be greater than one year and is measured by the average time intervening between the inception and the completion of those contracts. Contract-related assets and liabilities, as highlighted below, are classified as current assets and current liabilities. Significant balance sheet accounts related to the revenue recognition cycle are as follows:\n\u2022 Safety and Security; and\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nOur qualitative analysis as of October 1, 2020 included macroeconomic and industry and market-specific considerations, financial performance indicators and measurements, and other factors. Based on this qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our one reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, and thus the impairment test was not required to be performed. Historically, we have not recorded any impairment charges for goodwill.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to our actual results differing materially from those anticipated include those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020, and is incorporated by reference into this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the income tax position taken to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured in order to determine the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements. Penalties, if probable and reasonably estimable, and interest expense related to uncertain tax positions are not recognized as a component of income tax expense but recorded separately in indirect expenses or interest expense, respectively.\nThe table below shows our revenue by type of client as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated. Certain immaterial revenue amounts in the prior years have been reclassified due to minor adjustments and reclassification within client type.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $20.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $0.3 million or 1.5%. The increase in depreciation and amortization is the result of additional leasehold improvements acquired as part of the ITG acquisition which was offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization as a result of accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements on leases that terminated during the prior year.\nOur largest clients are U.S. federal government departments and agencies. In fact, our federal government clients have included every cabinet-level department, most significantly HHS, DOS, and DoD. Federal government clients generated approximately 44%, 38%, and 41% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. State and local government clients generated approximately 15%, 19%, and 14% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. International government clients generated approximately 6%, 8%, and 9% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022 Program Implementation Services;\nWe may proceed with work based on client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents. We have a review process for approving any such work. Revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated, and realization is probable. We base our estimates on a variety of factors, including previous experiences with the client, communications with the client regarding funding status, and our knowledge of available funding for the contract.\nWe are required to review other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2020 management evaluated its existing operating lease facilities and elected to discontinue the use of 16 leased facilities in advance of the lease termination date resulting in a $4.9 million charge for early contract termination. The $4.9 million charge included $3.1 million of impairment, $1.5 million of termination fees and $0.3 million of a loss on the disposition of related fixed assets and other costs.\nWe have explored various options of mitigating the risk associated with potential fluctuations in the foreign currencies in which we conduct transactions. We currently have hedges in an amount proportionate to work anticipated to be performed under certain contracts in Europe. We recognize changes in the fair-value of the hedges in our results of operations. We may increase the number, size and scope of our hedges as we analyze options for mitigating our foreign exchange and interest rate risk. The current impact of the foreign currency hedges to the consolidated financial statements is immaterial.\nThese following tables provide reconciliations of financial measures that are not U.S. GAAP ( non-GAAP\u201d) to the most applicable U.S. GAAP measures. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating our financial information, they should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies may define similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently and, accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how we define these measures.\n\u2022 Advisory Services;\nWe also see significant opportunity to further leverage our digital and client engagement capabilities across our commercial and government client base. Our future results will depend on the success of our strategy to enhance our client relationships and seek larger engagements that span the entire program life cycle, and to complete and successfully integrate additional strategic acquisitions. We will continue to focus on building scale in vertical and horizontal domain expertise, developing business with both our government and commercial clients, and replicating our business model in selective geographies. In doing so, we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities, such as our recent acquisition of ITG, that enhance our subject matter knowledge, broaden our service offerings, and/or provide scale in specific geographies. Although we continue to see favorable long-term market opportunities, there are certain business challenges facing all government service providers. Administrative and legislative actions by the federal government to address changing priorities or in response to the budget deficit could have a negative impact on our business, which may result in a reduction to our revenue and profit and adversely affect cash flow. Similarly, the very nature of opportunities arising out of disaster recovery mean they can involve unusual challenges. Factors such as the overall stress on communities and people affected by disaster recovery situations, political complexities and challenges among involved government agencies, and a higher-than-normal risk of audits and investigations may result in a reduction to our revenue and profit and adversely affect cash flow. However, we believe we are well positioned to provide a broad range of services in support of initiatives that will continue to be priorities to the federal government, as well as to state and local and international governments and commercial clients. We believe that the combination of internally generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, potential acquisitions, customary capital expenditures, and other working capital requirements.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 Federal government shutdowns; \n\u2022 Energy, Environment, and Infrastructure;\nOur clients utilize our services because we combine diverse institutional knowledge and experience with the deep subject matter expertise of our highly educated staff, which we deploy in multi-disciplinary teams. We have successfully worked with many of our clients for decades, with the result that we have a thorough and nuanced perspective of their objectives and needs. We serve both governmental and commercial clients. Our government clients include those from departments and agencies of the federal government, state (including territories) and local governments, and international governments. Our government efforts include work performed under subcontract agreements to commercial clients whose ultimate customer is government agencies and departments.\nOperating activities provided $173.1 million in cash for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $91.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash flows provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily due to strong collections of contract receivables related to disaster relief and rebuilding efforts as well as accelerated collections related to our media placements work for which the associated media spend will occur in early 2021. Additionally, we were able to defer employer social security tax liabilities, under the CARES Act, until 2021 and 2022. The increases in cash flows were partially offset by the reduction in net income and the use of cash to settle outstanding operating liabilities. The improved collections of contract receivables is evidenced by the reduction in our DSO from 83 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to 67 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The reduction in our DSO was primarily the result of an 11 day decrease due to the accelerated collection related to media placements.", "item_7_text": " \u2022 Changes in the scope of contracts; \nRevenue recognition entails the use of significant judgment, including, but not limited to, the following: evaluating agreements in terms of the number and nature of performance obligations; determining the appropriate method for measuring progress of the satisfaction of obligations; and preparing estimates in terms of the amount of progress that we have made. Most of our revenue is recognized over time and for many fixed-price contracts, in particular, we estimate the proportion of total revenue earned using the ratio of contract costs incurred to total estimated contract costs, which requires us to prepare estimates as work progresses of contract cost left to be incurred. Moreover, some of our contracts include variable consideration, which requires us to estimate the most likely amounts that will be earned over the respective contractually stipulated performance assessment periods. For these obligations, changes in estimates result in cumulative catch-up adjustments and may have a significant impact on earnings during a given period.\n \u2022 Number of billable days in a quarter; \n (2) Operating lease obligations include leases of facilities and equipment. See Note 7-Leases\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d The operating lease obligations includes the contractual obligations related to our new headquarters lease in Reston, Virginia. \nThe following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, expresses these items as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated and the period-over-period rate of change in each of them.\nFor cost-based contracts, we recognize revenue as a single performance obligation based on contract costs incurred, as we become contractually entitled to reimbursement of the contract costs, plus a most likely estimate of award or incentive fees earned on those costs even though final determination of fees earned occurs after the contractually stipulated performance assessment period ends.\nOur provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes are calculated from consolidated income based on current tax laws and any changes in tax rates from the rates used previously in determining the deferred tax assets and liabilities from temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and amounts on our tax returns.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 that require us to make future cash payments. Our summary of contractual obligations includes payments that we have an unconditional obligation to make.\n \u2022 Strategic decisions, such as acquisitions, consolidations, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments, and changes in business strategy; \n \u2022 Federal and state and local governments' and other clients' spending levels; \nRevenue Recognition\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS represents diluted EPS excluding the impact of certain items such as impairment of intangible assets, acquisition expenses, severance for staff realignment, facility consolidations and office closures, certain adjustments to the bad debt reserve and certain charges related to the retirement of our Executive Chair (which are also excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, as described further above), as well as the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions and income tax effects. While these adjustments may be recurring and not infrequent or unusual, we do not consider these adjustments to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and is not an alternative to basic or diluted EPS as a measure of performance. This presentation of non-GAAP diluted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may use different methods to prepare similarly titled measures. We believe that the supplemental adjustments applied in calculating non-GAAP diluted EPS are reasonable and appropriate to provide additional information to investors.\nWe prepare client invoices in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract, and billing terms may not be directly related to the performance of services. Contract assets are invoiced based on the achievement of specific events as defined by each contract, including deliverables, timetables, and incurrence of certain costs. Contract assets are classified as a current asset. Advanced billings to clients in excess of revenue earned are recorded as contract liabilities until the revenue recognition criteria are met. Reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses are included in revenue with corresponding costs incurred by us included in the cost of revenue. We record revenue net of taxes collected from clients when the taxes are collected on behalf of the governmental authorities.\n \u2022 Changes in contract margin performance due to performance risks; \nService revenue represents revenue less subcontractor and other direct costs (which include third-party materials and travel expenses). Service revenue is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to revenue as a measure of operating performance. This presentation of service revenue may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may use different methods to prepare similarly titled measures. We believe service revenue is a useful measure to investors since, as a consulting firm, a key metric is revenue generated from the services our employees provide to our clients. For the year ended December 31, 2020, service revenue grew $40.7 million or 4.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, service revenue represented 69.3% of total revenue compared to 67.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The table below presents a reconciliation of revenue to service revenue for the periods indicated:\nOur results of operations and cash flows may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\nThe Future Customer - In January 2018, we acquired TFC, a leading boutique loyalty strategy and marketing company based in London, U.K. The acquisition of TFC enhanced and extended our customer loyalty business to Europe.\nA reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA follows:\nOther long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2020 consists primarily of $17.3 million of deferred compensation plan liabilities, $10.0 million of the long-term portion of the deferred Company social security taxes under the CARES Act, $7.2 million of liabilities related to the long-term portion of fair value of outstanding hedges, and outstanding commitments under an acquisition agreement of $1.2 million.\nPayments on cost-based contracts with the U.S. Federal government are provisional payments subject to audit and adjustment. Our USAID-cognizant indirect cost rates have been finalized through December 31, 2014, and its NIH-cognizant cost rates have been finalized through December 31, 2011. Contract revenue have been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final audit and cost settlement and we do not believe any additional, material revenue adjustments will result from finalizing the indirect rates and closing open audit years.\nWe are required to adjust stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. We estimate the rate of future forfeitures based on factors which include our historical experience, but the amount of actual forfeitures may differ from current estimates particularly if the rate of future forfeitures is different from previous experience. In addition, the estimation of PSAs that will ultimately vest requires judgment in terms of estimates of future performance. To the extent actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures and actual performance or updated performance estimates differ from current estimates, such expense amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates are revised. See Note 15-Accounting for Stock-based Compensation\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for further discussion.\nInterest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense was $13.9 million, compared to $10.7 million for the prior year, an increase of $3.2 million or 29.6%. The higher interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was due to higher average debt balances, primarily due to the financing of the ITG acquisition, partially offset by lower average interest rates for the period ended December 31, 2020 compared to the period ended December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 Timing of receipt of invoices from, and payments to, employees and vendors; \n (6) Adjustments related to bad debt reserve: During 2018, we established a bad debt reserve for amounts due from a utility client that had filed for bankruptcy and included the reserve as an adjustment due to its relative size. The adjustment in 2019 reflects a favorable revision of our prior estimate of collectability based on a third party acquiring the receivables. \nWe are monitoring the evolving situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic and we continue to work with our stakeholders to assess further possible implications to our business and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. To protect employee health and safety while COVID-19 remains a threat, we plan to continue to deliver a majority of our services to clients remotely for the foreseeable future and continue to evaluate our return to office plans. While the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act contains a provision that allows federal contractors to seek specified reimbursement for certain employees who are unable to perform their contract requirements due to government restrictions, we believe we have limited claims under the CARES Act, and reimbursements are also subject to limitations and do not extend past December 31, 2020. Additionally, we exercised the option to defer payment of the employer portion of the Social Security tax, with 50% to be repaid by December 31, 2021 and the remainder by December 31, 2022. We deferred payment of approximately $20.9 million of employer Social Security taxes during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\ncapital expenditures and acquisitions. The cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 included acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $253.3 million, of which $253.1 million was for ITG and $0.2 million was for Eco-Tech, and $17.7 million for capital expenditures. The cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $26.9 million for capital expenditures and acquisitions of $3.6 million.\nUnder a contract with a customer commencing in the final quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company receives advance payments to be used to pay providers of services to the customer, a separate third-party. The advanced payments are treated as restricted cash as the Company is required under the contract to distribute the advanced funds to the third-party providers or return the advanced funds to the customer. Because the Company receives the advance payments from a customer, which must be refunded to the customer or remitted to a third party, the cash receipts are treated as borrowings rather than receipts for the provision of goods or services. Therefore, these cash receipts are presented as financing cash inflows, Receipt of restricted contract funds\u201d, with the subsequent payments classified as financing cash outflows, Payment of restricted cash contract funds.\u201d\nCash Flows. We consider cash on deposit and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. The following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash for the following years.\nWhen a performance obligation is billed using a time-and-materials contract type, we use the right to invoice practical expedient output progress measures to estimate revenue earned based on hours worked in contract performance at negotiated billing rates. Fixed-price level-of-effort contracts are substantially similar to time-and-materials contracts except that we are required to deliver a specified level of effort over a stated period of time. For these contracts, we estimate revenue earned using contract hours worked at negotiated bill rates as we deliver the contractually required workforce.\nWe also evaluate whether two or more agreements should be accounted for as one single contract and whether combined or single agreements should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. For most contracts, the client requires that we perform a number of tasks in providing an integrated output and, hence, each of these contracts is tracked as having only one performance obligation. When contracts are separated into multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised services underlying each performance obligation. We generally provide customized solutions in which the pricing is based on specific negotiations with each client, and, in these cases, we use a cost-plus margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. It is common for our long-term contracts to contain award fees, incentive fees or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts are generally awarded at the completion of a prescribed performance assessment period based on the achievement of performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, and the amount awarded may be subject to client discretion. Variable consideration is estimated based on the most likely amount. Estimates of variable consideration will be constrained only to the extent that it is probable that significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nClient markets\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $13.8 million on December 31, 2020, from $6.5 million on December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had restricted cash of $68.1 million, all of which was classified as a current asset. These balances and the changes to the balances of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are further discussed in Cash Flow\u201d below and discussed in Note 3-Restricted Cash\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nWe had ten outstanding letters of credit provided for under our Credit Facility with a total value of $2.7 million, primarily related to deposits to support our facility leases.\nOur discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses during the reporting period and our application of critical accounting policies, including: revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. If any of these estimates or judgments prove to be incorrect, our reported results could be materially affected. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting practices described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and, therefore, consider them to be critical accounting policies. Significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies listed below, are more fully described and discussed in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nOperating lease - right-of-use assets decreased from $134.0 million as of December 31, 2019 to $127.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and the operating lease liability, both current and long-term, decreased from $151.8 million at December 31, 2019 to $139.0 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the right-of-use assets is due to $32.3 of amortization, $3.1 million of impairment, and $2.0 million reduction resulting from modification/contractual termination of leases, offset by $29.8 million of right-of-use assets under new leases and foreign currency impact of $0.7 million. The decrease in the operating lease liability is due to principal payments of $41.0 million, $12.5 million of additional pre-payment of lease commitments in December 2020, and a $1.6 million reduction resulting from modification/contractual termination of leases, offset by additional lease liabilities under new leases.\nWe provide professional services and technology-based solutions to government and commercial clients. Our services include management, marketing, technology, and policy consulting, and implementation services. We help our clients conceive, develop, implement, and improve solutions that address complex business, natural resource, social, technological, and public safety issues. Our services primarily support clients that operate in four key markets:\nAdjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations. We evaluate these adjustments on an individual basis based on both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including their size and nature, as well as whether or not we expect them to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We believe that the adjustments applied in calculating adjusted EBITDA are reasonable and appropriate to provide additional information to investors.\nOur operating cash flows are primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts, our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner, and the timing of vendor and subcontractor payments in accordance with negotiated payment terms. We bill most of our clients on a monthly basis after services are rendered.\nShort-term liquidity requirements are created by our use of funds for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings. Our primary source of borrowings is from our Credit Facility, as described in Note 10-Long-Term Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n\nContract mix\n</table>\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nFor performance obligations requiring the delivery of a service for a fixed price, we use the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs, provided that costs incurred (an input method) represents a reasonable measure of progress towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation, in order to estimate the portion of total revenue earned. This method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of value to the client when we are satisfying a performance obligation that entails integration of tasks for a combined output, which requires us to coordinate the work of employees, subcontractors and delivery of other contract costs. Contract costs that are not reflective of our progress toward satisfying a performance obligation are not included in the calculation of the measure of progress. When this method is used, changes in estimated costs to complete these obligations result in adjustments to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis, which causes the effect of revised estimates for prior periods to be recognized in the current period. Changes in these estimates can routinely occur over contract performance for a variety of reasons, which include: changes in contract scope; changes in contract cost estimates due to unanticipated cost growth or reassessments of risks impacting costs; changes in estimated incentive or award fees; or performing better or worse than previously estimated.\n\u2022 Engagement Services.\n (1) Income tax effects were calculated using an effective U.S. GAAP tax rate of 26.4%, 23.6% and 25.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nClient type\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSELECTED KEY METRICS\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel COVID-19 virus as a global pandemic. There is significant uncertainty as to effects of this pandemic on the global economy, which in turn may impact, among other things, our ability to generate historical levels of positive cash flows from operations and our ability to successfully execute and fund key initiatives. However, our current belief is that the combination of internally generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, customary capital expenditures and acquisitions, quarterly cash dividends, share repurchases and organic growth. Additionally, we continuously analyze our capital structure to ensure we have capital to fund future strategic acquisitions. We monitor the state of the financial markets on a regular basis to assess the availability and cost of additional capital resources from both debt and equity sources. We believe that we will be able to access these markets at commercially reasonable terms and conditions if, in the future, we need additional borrowings or capital.\nThe ICF International, Inc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended, (the 2018 Omnibus Plan\u201d) provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, and other stock-based awards to all officers, key employees, and non-employee directors. The 2018 Omnibus Plan replaced the previous 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Prior Plan\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 1,107,968 shares available for grant under the 2018 Omnibus Plan.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel strain of coronavirus disease COVID-19 as a global pandemic. There continues to be significant uncertainty as to the effects of this pandemic on the global economy, which may impact, among other things, our operations, balance sheet, results of operations or cash flows. Adverse events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel, the potential impact on our employees, clients, subcontractors and other suppliers and business partners, a slow-down in customer decision-making that affects procurement cycles, a reprioritization of client spending, and other matters affecting the general work and business environment have harmed, and could continue to harm, our business and delay the implementation of our business strategy. We cannot fully anticipate all the ways in which the current global health crisis, economic slowdown and financial market conditions will adversely impact our business in the future. The longer the duration of the pandemic, the advent of new strains of the virus and challenges faced in the rollout of vaccines, the more likely it is that it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe following table shows the approximate percentage of our revenue for each of these types of contracts for the periods indicated. Certain immaterial revenue amounts in the prior years have been reclassified due to minor adjustments and reclassification within contract type.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe report operating results and financial data as a single segment based on the consolidated information used by our chief operating decision-maker in evaluating the financial performance of our business and allocating resources. Our single segment represents our core business: professional services for government and commercial clients. Although we describe our multiple service offerings to clients that operate in four markets to provide a better understanding of the scope and scale of our business, we do not manage our business or allocate our resources based on those service offerings or client markets. Rather, on a project-by-project basis, we assemble the best team from throughout the enterprise to deliver highly customized solutions that are tailored to meet the needs of each client.\nContract receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, decreased to $222.9 million on December 31, 2020 compared to $261.2 million on December 31, 2019, primarily due to significant collection of outstanding receivables and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, primarily related to two clients filing for bankruptcy. Contract receivables are a significant component of our working capital and generally increase due to revenue growth and may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by our collection efforts, including timing from new contract startups, and other short-term fluctuations related to the payment practices of our clients. Contract assets and contract liabilities represent revenue in excess of billings and billings in excess of revenue, respectively, both of which generally arise from revenue recognition timing and contractually stipulated billing schedules or billing complexity. As of December 31, 2020, contract assets and contract liabilities were $143.4 million and $42.1 million, respectively, compared to $142.3 million and $37.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nAs part of management actions to counter the impact of COVID-19, we continue to align our costs with anticipated revenues. In the U.S. and in our international operations, we have used staff reductions, furloughs, and other temporary wage reduction programs in response to the pandemic. We incurred $2.1 million in severance costs related to unanticipated terminations associated with COVID-19. We are currently participating in several international government subsidy programs, providing approximately $3.0 million as of December 31, 2020, whose objective is to encourage eligible companies to keep employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. A requirement of these subsidies is that we continue to employ the identified employees who might otherwise have been impacted by a reaction to COVID-19. The subsidies are limited in the amount and time in which payroll costs are covered.\nRevenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $1,506.9 million, compared to $1,478.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $28.4 million or 1.9%. The increase in revenue was attributable to an increase in governmental revenue of $22.5 million, or 2.3%, and an increase in commercial revenue of $5.8 million, or 1.1%, compared to the prior year. The changes in government revenue by client type were driven by the increase in federal government revenue, including clients from the ITG acquisition, offset by a decrease in state and local government revenue, from our disaster recovery clients, and a decrease in international government revenue. The increase in our commercial revenue by client market was driven by increases in revenue from energy, environment and infrastructure clients and health, education, and social program clients, including clients from our ITG acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in marketing services provided to our consumer and financial clients, which have been impacted by COVID-19, compared to the prior year. The governmental and commercial revenues as a percent of total revenue remained consistent at 65% and 35% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with 65% and 35% for the prior year.\n \u2022 Commencement, completion, and termination of contracts; \nIndirect and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $411.6 million compared to $395.8 million for the prior year, an increase of $15.8 million or 4.0%. The increase in indirect and selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in indirect labor, associated fringe costs, and other compensation costs of $25.6 million, and a decrease in general and administrative costs of $9.8 million. The increase in indirect labor, associated fringe costs, and other compensation costs is due to the general increase in labor year over year and additional severance costs from our internal restructuring and $8.8 million expense related to obligations under the Executive Chair's employment agreement. The decrease in general and administrative costs was due to a reduction of travel-related expenses of $10.3 million, a decrease related to the $1.7 million impairment of intangible assets in the prior year, a decrease in our use of contract labor in the current year, and the decline in non-labor related administrative costs in the current year, offset by increases in the current year of $4.4 million of expenses related to the termination, abandonment, or impairment of several operating leases, a $3.4 million increase in bad debt expenses, and other increased costs due to our investments in our internal infrastructure and processes, and professional fees and insurance costs associated with our acquisition activities. Indirect and selling expenses as a percent of revenue increased to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 26.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in indirect and selling expenses as a percent of revenue is due to expenses in 2020 related to termination of operating leases and expenses related to the departing officer's employment in our indirect and selling expenses for the year ending December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Borrowing Capacity. On March 3, 2020, we entered into the First Amendment (the First Amendment\u201d) to the Fifth Amended and Restated Business Loan and Security Agreement with a group of 10 lenders (the Credit Facility\u201d). The First Amendment amended the Fifth Amended and Restated Business Loan and Security Agreement, entered on May 17, 2017. As a result of the First Amendment, we increased our borrowing capacity by $200.0 million through the addition of a $200.0 million term loan to the Credit Facility. The First Amendment also made certain other changes to the Credit Facility as described in Note 10-Long-Term Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d. Additionally, we incurred additional loan fees of $2.1 million.\nContract receivables, net - This account includes amounts billed or billable under contract terms. The amounts due are stated at their net realizable value. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected. We consider a number of factors in our estimate of the allowance, including knowledge of a client's financial condition, its historical collection experience, and other factors relevant to assessing the collectability of the receivables.\n\nFor the purpose of performing the annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2020, as our business is highly integrated and all of our components have similar economic characteristics, we have concluded we have one aggregated reporting unit at a consolidated entity level. We assess goodwill at the reporting level. For the goodwill impairment test, we opted to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, we may conclude that no impairment exists. If we conclude otherwise, a goodwill impairment test must be performed, which includes a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognizing, as an impairment loss, the difference of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying amount.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13.3 million compared to $8.1 million for the prior year. The $5.3 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of additional intangible assets related to the ITG acquisition totaling $47.3 million, partially offset by reduced levels of amortization of intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions.\nWe evaluate our collections efforts using the days-sales-outstanding ratio ( DSO\u201d), which we calculate by dividing total accounts receivable (contract receivables, net and contract assets, less contract liabilities) by revenue per day for the trailing three months period. Days-sales-outstanding decreased to 67 days compared to 83 days during the prior year primarily due to significant collection efforts of our disaster relief and rebuilding contracts as well as accelerated collections related to media buys. The DSO, excluding disaster relief and rebuilding efforts, was 60 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to 71 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.\nOur cash flows used in financing activities consists primarily of debt and equity transactions. For the year ended 2020, cash flows used in financing activities were primarily due to the net advance from our Credit Facility of $150.3 million, net receipt and payments of restricted contract funds of $65.6 million, dividend payments of $10.6 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan and shares purchased from employees to pay required withholding taxes related to settlement of restricted stock units of $29.7 million. For the year ended 2019, cash flows used in financing activities were primarily due to net payments on our Credit Facility of $35.0 million, dividend payments of $10.5 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan and shares purchased from employees to pay required withholding taxes related to settlement of restricted stock units of $23.4 million.\nNotwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, we believe that, in the long-term, demand for our services will continue to grow as government, industry, and other stakeholders seek to address critical long-term societal and natural resource issues due to heightened concerns about clean energy and energy efficiency; health promotion, treatment, and cost control; natural disaster relief and rebuild efforts; and ongoing homeland security threats. In the wake of the major hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, Maria, Laura and Michael) that devastated communities in Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, the affected areas remain in various stages of relief and recovery efforts. We believe our prior and current experience with disaster relief and rebuild efforts, including those from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and Superstorm Sandy, put us in a favorable position to continue to provide recovery and housing assistance, and environmental and infrastructure solutions on behalf of federal departments and agencies, state, territorial and local jurisdictions, and regional agencies.\nEco-Tech Consultants, Inc. - In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Eco-Tech, an ecological consulting firm located in Louisville, Kentucky. The firm provides a range of ecological services across the Eastern United States and will greatly increase our capacity to support a growing portfolio of transportation agency clients in the Eastern United States.\nThe following table shows revenue generated from client markets as a percent of total revenue for the periods indicated. For each client, we have attributed all revenue from that client to the market we consider to be the client's primary market, even if a portion of that revenue relates to a different market. Certain minor revenue amounts reported in the prior years have been reclassified within key market categories based on our current view of the client's primary market in order to increase comparability of the current year to prior years.\n \u2022 Timing of client orders; \nThe increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2.0 million, net of taxes, was driven by a change of $5.2 million in the fair value of the interest rate hedging instruments, $0.5 million in gains reclassified to income related to hedging instruments previously sold and offset by a $3.7 million change in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (primarily the British Pound, Euro and Canadian dollar. See Note 14-Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\n\u2022 Health, Education, and Social Programs;\nThe purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over such lives and reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators arise. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill and intangibles assets were $909.9 million and $59.9 million, respectively.\nLong-term contracts typically contain billing terms that provide for invoicing monthly or upon completion of milestones and payment on a net 30-day basis. Exceptions to monthly billing terms are to ensure that we perform satisfactorily rather than representing a significant financing component. For cost-based contracts, our performance is evaluated during a contractually stipulated performance period and, while contract costs may be billed on a monthly basis, we are generally permitted to bill for incentive or award fees only after the completion of the performance assessment period, which may occur quarterly, semi-annually or annually, and after the client completes the performance assessment. Fixed-price contracts may provide for milestone billings based on the attainment of specific project objectives and, since they are tied to our project performance, these type of billing terms do not represent a significant financing component. Moreover, contracts may require retentions or hold backs that are paid at the end of the contract to ensure that we perform in accordance with requirements which do not represent our providing financing to our clients but rather are a means to ensure that we meet contract requirements. We do not assess whether a contract contains a significant financing component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between payment by the client and the transfer of promised services to the client will be one year or less.\n (3) Special charges related to severance for staff realignment: These costs are mainly due to involuntary employee termination benefits for Company officers, groups of employees who have been terminated as part of a consolidation or reorganization or, to the extent that the costs are not included in the previous two categories, involuntary employee termination benefits for employees who have been terminated as a result of COVID-19. \nA key element of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions. In 2018, we acquired The Future Customer ( TFC\u201d), DMS Disaster Consultants ( DMS\u201d), and We Are Vista Limited ( Vista\u201d). In January 2020 and December 2020, we completed the acquisitions of ITG and Eco-Tech Consultants, Inc. ( Eco-Tech\u201d). While providing capabilities and access to new clients in support of our growth strategy, these acquisitions were not significant to our financial statements taken as a whole.\nWe primarily provide services and technology-based solutions for clients that operate in a variety of markets and the solutions may span the entire program life cycle, from initial research and analysis to the design and implementation of solutions. We enter into agreements with clients that create enforceable rights and obligations and for which it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we will be entitled as services and solutions are transferred to the client. Except in certain narrowly defined situations, our agreements with our clients are written and revenue is generally not recognized on oral or implied arrangements. We recognize revenue based on the consideration specified in the applicable agreement and exclude from revenue amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Accordingly, sales and similar taxes which are collected for third parties are excluded from the transaction price.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate our ability to benefit from all deferred tax assets and establish valuation allowances for amounts we believe are not more likely than not to be realized.\n\n \u2022 Changes in staff utilization; \nWe are primarily a service business, and our staffing, and that of our subcontractors, has been maintained, substantially on a work from home basis, fortunately with little COVID-19 illness among our staff. To date we have experienced continuity in the majority of our work for our government clients, which accounted for approximately 65% of our revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There have been postponements of events and challenges around some project work requiring travel, but overall, our government clients have continued to require our services. We are unable to predict whether, and to what extent, this trend will continue. It would be reasonable to expect that some deterioration of certain client activities has occurred and will continue to occur due to COVID-19, but there is also the possibility of additional demand from federal agencies such as the CDC, HHS, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as state and local and international government agencies.\n\u2022 Analytics Services;\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be used as alternatives to net income as a measure of operating performance. This presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may use different methods to prepare similarly titled measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management's discretionary use as these measures do not include certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, capital expenditures and debt service.\nInvesting activities used cash of $270.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our cash flows used in investing activities consists primarily of\nThe increase in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are primarily due to the lease acquired as part of the ITG acquisition and new facilities in Chicago. In the fourth quarter of 2020, management reviewed our operating lease facilities and, as a result of the review, we took a $4.9 million charge for both the contractual termination of 13 leases and the impairment of 3 leases for our discontinued use of the properties. The $4.9 million charge included $3.1 million in impairment, $1.5 million in termination fees, and $0.3 million in losses on the disposition of related fixed assets and other costs. The 13 terminated leases had lease end dates ranging from December 2020 to September 2024.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n (4) Special charges related to facilities consolidations, office closures, and our future corporate headquarters: These costs are exit costs associated with terminated leases or full office closures. The exit costs include charges incurred under a contractual obligation that existed as of the date of the accrual and for which we will (i) continue to pay until the contractual obligation is satisfied but with no economic benefit to us or (ii) we contractually terminated the obligation and ceased utilizing the facilities. Additionally, we incurred one-time charges with respect to the execution of a new lease agreement for our corporate headquarters. \nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n \u2022 Timing of events related to discrete tax items; \n \u2022 Additions to, and departures of, staff; \n \u2022 Timing of award fee notices; \nDirect costs. Direct costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $972.4 million compared to $953.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $19.2 million or 2.0%. The increase in direct costs and associated fringe costs was attributable to an increase of $31.6 million in direct labor and associated fringe benefits costs offset by a $12.4 million decrease in subcontractor and other direct costs. The direct labor and associated fringe costs increase is the result of an increase in our federal government revenues, as discussed above, partially offset by the decline in direct labor in our international government clients and our commercial clients. The decrease in subcontractor and other direct costs is due to the decline in other direct costs of $12.0 million, primarily travel related costs offset by an increase in media buys, and a $0.4 million decline in subcontractor costs. The decline in subcontractor costs is due to the decline in revenue from contracts that are reliant upon subcontractors, such as the hurricane relief and recovery efforts and marketing services, offset by subcontractor costs from the ITG acquisition. Direct costs as a percent of revenue remained constant at 64.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe Are Vista Limited - In October 2018, we acquired Vista, a communications company headquartered in Leeds, U.K., with an additional presence in London. Vista provides advisory services and solutions to clients in the financial, retail, automobile, and energy industries and broadens our capabilities in the region.\nPayments to us on cost-based contracts with the federal government are provisional payments subject to adjustment upon audit by the government. Such audits have been finalized through 2011 for NIH-cognizant indirect rates and through 2014 for USAID-cognizant indirect rates, and any adjustments have been immaterial. Contract revenue for subsequent periods has been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized on final audit and settlement of costs in those years.\nIn some fixed price service contracts, we perform services of a recurring nature, such as maintenance and other services of a stand ready\u201d nature. For these contracts, we have the right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value that the client has received. Therefore, we record revenue on a time-elapsed basis to reflect the transfer of control to the client throughout the contract.\nWe recognized total compensation expense relating to stock-based compensation of $24.6 million, $26.0 million, and $19.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock awards, and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We treat CSRSUs as liability-classified awards, and account for them at fair value based on the closing price of our stock at the balance sheet date. We recognize expense for performance-based share awards ( PSAs\u201d), which are subject to a performance condition and a market condition, on a straight-line basis over the performance period. Non-employee director awards are expensed over the performance period.\nContract mix varies from year to year due to numerous factors, including our business strategies and the procurement activities of our clients. Unless the context requires otherwise, we use the term contracts\u201d to refer to contracts and any task orders or delivery orders issued under a contract. There are three main types of contracts: time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, and cost-based contracts. For a detailed discussion of contract types, see Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition\u201d above.\nService Revenue\nOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK\nWe began granting awards of registered shares to our non-employee directors on an annual basis under the 2018 Omnibus Plan in the third quarter of 2018. Previously, under the Prior Plan, we granted awards of unregistered shares to the directors under the Annual Equity Election program. Those awards were issued from treasury stock and had no impact on the shares available for grant under the Prior Plan.\nStock-based Compensation\n \u2022 Paid time off taken by our employees; \nContract liabilities - This account consists of advance payments received and billings in excess of revenue recognized on contracts. Contract liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis each period even though individual contracts may contain multiple performance obligations.\nIMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nWe drew upon our Credit Facility to fund the ITG acquisition and subsequently had a net payment on our credit facility of $104.7 million from operating cash flows. The improvement in cash flow from operations was primarily driven by the timing of client billings and collections of our disaster relief and rebuild contracts as well as the unexpected acceleration of billing and collections for media buys. However, the timing of cash flow from disaster relief and rebuild efforts is more uncertain than from other clients due to factors such as political complexities and challenges among involved government agencies. Moreover, the billing processes have complex reporting requirements and the funding processes have been slow to distribute funds once billed.\nOperating income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, operating income was $89.1 million compared to $101.4 million for the prior year, a decrease of $12.3 million or 12.1%. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 5.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 6.9% for the prior year. The changes were largely due to an increase in indirect and selling expenses, associated with expense related to obligations under the Executive Chair's employment agreement, and an increase in amortization of intangible assets partially offset by higher revenues.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn order to evaluate operations, we track revenue by key metrics that provide useful information about the nature of our operations. Client markets provide insight into the breadth of our expertise. Client type is an indicator of the diversity of our client base. Revenue by contract mix provides insight in terms of the degree of performance risk that we have assumed. Significant variances in the key metrics tables that are provided below are discussed under the revenue section of the results of operations.\nFinancial Condition. There were several changes in our balance sheet during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. The more significant changes are discussed below.\nOf the remaining 35% of our total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the majority was generated from commercial energy markets and commercial marketing services, each of which represented roughly half of that total. In commercial energy, where we work primarily for utility clients, we have experienced trends similar to those with our government clients, although some aspects of energy efficiency programs have been put on hold as they involve direct interaction with consumers. In our commercial marketing services, a key component of our business is our industry-leading loyalty platform, where we have long-term implementation contracts, and we believe our clients, many of which are in the hospitality space, will continue to stay engaged with their most loyal customers. The other parts of commercial marketing services, which include public event management and marketing technology, were impacted based on the restriction upon travel worldwide and the deferral or cancellation of marketing events. Some of these commercial clients perform work in travel-related markets and have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we are monitoring that business area closely. These elements of commercial marketing services represented less than 16% of our total Company-wide revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nITEM 7.\n \u2022 Progress of contract performance; \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted EPS for the periods indicated:\n\n\nEarnings before interest and other income and/or expense, tax, and depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is a measure we use to evaluate operating performance. We believe EBITDA is useful in assessing ongoing trends and, as a result, may provide greater visibility in understanding our operations.\n\u2022 Digital Services; and\n (2) Special charges related to acquisitions: These costs consist primarily of consultants and other outside third-party costs, integration costs associated with an acquisition, and an adjustment to the contingent consideration liability from a previous acquisition. \nDMS Disaster Consultants - In August 2018, we acquired DMS, a disaster management and recovery firm based in Florida, to broaden our capabilities in support of assisting communities, businesses and individuals recover from man-made and nature disasters. DMS assists public sector clients with man-made and natural disaster planning and preparedness, and post-disaster response and recovery efforts by assisting clients in obtaining federal funding from Federal the Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), insurance companies, and other sources.\nIncentive Technology Group, LLC - In January 2020, we completed the acquisition of ITG, one of the leading providers of cloud-based platform services to the federal government. ITG provides solutions through the adoption of next generation technologies for federal government agencies, many of which are among our long-standing clients.\n (5) Special charges related to retirement of Executive Chair: These costs include severance, pro rata incentive bonus, welfare benefits, and acceleration of equity awards we incurred under the departing officer's severance agreement during the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result of the employment agreement, the departing officer was able to maintain certain equity awards beyond his date of employment. \n</td> </tr>\nDrawing from our domain knowledge and staff experience in working in multi-disciplinary teams for clients in a variety of markets, we provide services to our diverse client base that deliver value throughout the entire life cycle of a policy, program, project, or initiative. Our primary services include:\nOther expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expense was flat at $0.5 million compared to other expense of $0.5 million for the prior year.\nAs a service provider, we generally recognize revenue over time as control is transferred to a client, based on the extent of progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. The selection of the method used to measure progress requires judgment and, among other things, is dependent on the contract type selected by the client during contract negotiation and the nature of the services and solutions to be provided.\nWe also serve a variety of commercial clients worldwide, including: airlines, airports, electric and gas utilities, health care companies, banks and other financial services companies, transportation, travel and hospitality firms, non-profits/associations, manufacturing firms, retail chains, and distribution companies. Our commercial clients, which include clients outside the U.S., generated approximately 35%, 35%, and 36% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nStock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of these instruments and the estimated number of shares ultimately expected to vest. The calculation of the fair value of the awards requires certain inputs that are subjective and changes to the estimates used will cause the fair value of stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense to vary. The fair value of stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs, PSAs and non-employee director awards is estimated based on the fair value of a share of common stock at the grant date. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The fair value of a stock option award is affected by the price of our stock on the date of grant, as well as other assumptions used as inputs in the valuation model. These assumptions include the estimated volatility of the price of our stock over the term of the awards, the estimated period of time that we expect employees will hold stock options, and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of PSAs is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\nYears Ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share\n(dollars in thousands)\n (1) Adjustment related to impairment of long-lived assets: We recognized impairment expense of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to impairment of right-of-use lease assets and $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 related to an intangible asset associated with a historical business acquisition. \nIndirect and selling expenses. Indirect and selling expenses generally include our management, facilities, and infrastructure costs for all employees and the salaries and wages related to indirect activities, including stock-based and cash-based incentive compensation provided to employees whose compensation and other benefit costs are included in indirect and selling expenses, plus associated fringe benefits not directly related to client engagements.\nWe evaluate contractual arrangements to determine whether revenue should be recognized on a gross versus net basis. Our assessment is based on the nature of the promise to the client. In most cases, we agree to provide specified services to the client as a principal and revenue is recognized on a gross basis. In certain instances, we act as an agent and merely arrange for another party to provide services to the client and revenue is recognized on a net basis in reflection of the fact that we do not control the goods or services provided to the client by the other party.\n (1) Represents the obligation for principal and variable interest payments related to the Credit Facility assuming the principal amount outstanding and interest rates at December 31, 2020 remain fixed through maturity. These assumptions are subject to change in future periods. \n \u2022 Level and cost of our debt; \nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\n \u2022 Our contract mix and use of subcontractors or the timing of other direct costs for which we may earn lower contract margin; \n \u2022 Extraordinary economic events and natural disasters; \n \u2022 General market and economic conditions. \nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nProvision for income taxes. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, was 26.4% and 23.6%, respectively. Our effective tax rate, including state and foreign taxes net of federal benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, was higher than the statutory tax rate for the year primarily due to tax benefits for stock-based compensation, permanently non-taxable income and state tax credits, and partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, permanent differences related to compensation costs, and other expenses not deductible for tax purposes.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, as discussed in Note 6-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d and Note 16 - Business Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d, increased due to the acquisition of ITG and the impact of foreign currency translation. On January 31, 2020, we acquired ITG, for the purchase price of $255.0 million. The acquisition resulted in the recording of $188.3 million in goodwill and $47.3 million in intangible assets.\n\u2022 Consumer and Financial.\nNew accounting standards are discussed in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\n \u2022 Variations in purchasing patterns under our contracts; \nOur primary clients are the agencies and departments of the federal government and commercial clients. Most of our revenue is from contracts on which we are the prime contractor, which we believe provides us strong client relationships. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, approximately 92%, 92%, and 92% of our revenue, respectively, was from prime contracts.\n\nWe utilize cash settled RSUs ( CSRSUs\u201d) which are settled only in cash payments. The cash payment is calculated by multiplying the number of CSRSUs vested by our closing stock price on the vesting date, subject to a maximum payment cap and a minimum payment floor. CSRSUs have no impact on the shares available for grant under the 2018 Omnibus Plan and have no impact on the calculated shares used in EPS calculations.\nBecause a significant portion of our expenses (such as personnel, facilities, and related costs) are fixed in the short-term, contract performance and variation in the volume of activity, as well as in the number and volume of contracts commenced or completed during any year, may cause significant variations in operating results from year to year. We generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years, although we cannot ensure that we will be able to do so in the future.\n \u2022 Timing of billings to, and collection of payments from clients; \nDividends. Cash dividends declared in 2020 were as follows:\nShare Repurchase Program. The objective of the share repurchase program has been to offset dilution resulting from employee stock compensation. The Company meets its objective to offset dilution via its 10b5-1 and 10b-18 trading plans. In September 2017 the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes share repurchases in the aggregate up to $100.0 million. Our total repurchases are also limited by the Credit Facility as described in Note 18-Share Repurchase Program\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d. Our overall repurchase limit is the lower of the amount imposed by our board of directors and by the Credit Facility. Previously, purchases under the repurchase program could be made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), and in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. On March 13, 2020, we terminated the Rule 105b-1 element of the share repurchase program. We subsequently approved an updated Rule 10b5-1 plan element of the share repurchase program, as part of its normal process, that is scheduled to commence January 2021. The purchases will be funded from existing cash balances and/or borrowings, and the repurchased shares will be held in treasury and used for general corporate purposes. The timing and extent to which we repurchase our shares will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations, as may be considered in our sole discretion. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 278,582 shares under this program at an average price of $78.66 per share. As of December 31, 2020, $46.1 million remained available for share repurchases under the share repurchase program.\nLong-term debt increased to $313.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $164.3 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to financing of our $255 million acquisition of ITG partially offset by the net payments on our Credit Facility of $104.7 million. The average debt balance on the Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $428.0 million and $268.6 million, respectively. The average interest rate on the Credit Facility, excluding any fees and unamortized debt issuance costs, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 2.4% and 3.6%, respectively. We generally utilize cash flow from operations as our primary source of funding and turn to our Credit Facility to fund any temporary fluctuations, such as increases in contract receivables, reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses, purchase of treasury stock, payment of declared dividends, additional capital expenditures, and to meet funding requirements for new acquisitions.\n \u2022 Timing of significant costs and investments (such as bid and proposal costs and the costs involved in planning or making acquisitions); \n\nOn February 20, 2020, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement (the Swap\u201d) for a notional amount of $100.0 million in order to hedge a portion of the Company's floating rate Credit Facility. Similar to the previous swap agreements that the Company has entered into, this Swap is intended to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional amount hedged totaled $200.0 million, excluding the hedge sold on December 1, 2016, and were valued at an unrealized loss of $10.9 million, before tax, and are included in other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 12-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\n \u2022 Changes in accounting principles and policies; and/or \nContract assets - This account includes unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized on contracts when the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amounts billed. It also includes contract retainages until we have met the contract-stipulated requirements for payment. Contract assets are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis each period even though individual contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. On a contract-by-contract basis, amounts do not exceed their net realizable value.\nOur operating cycle for long-term contracts may be greater than one year and is measured by the average time intervening between the inception and the completion of those contracts. Contract-related assets and liabilities, as highlighted below, are classified as current assets and current liabilities. Significant balance sheet accounts related to the revenue recognition cycle are as follows:\n\u2022 Safety and Security; and\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nOur qualitative analysis as of October 1, 2020 included macroeconomic and industry and market-specific considerations, financial performance indicators and measurements, and other factors. Based on this qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our one reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, and thus the impairment test was not required to be performed. Historically, we have not recorded any impairment charges for goodwill.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to our actual results differing materially from those anticipated include those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020, and is incorporated by reference into this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the income tax position taken to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured in order to determine the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements. Penalties, if probable and reasonably estimable, and interest expense related to uncertain tax positions are not recognized as a component of income tax expense but recorded separately in indirect expenses or interest expense, respectively.\nThe table below shows our revenue by type of client as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated. Certain immaterial revenue amounts in the prior years have been reclassified due to minor adjustments and reclassification within client type.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $20.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $0.3 million or 1.5%. The increase in depreciation and amortization is the result of additional leasehold improvements acquired as part of the ITG acquisition which was offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization as a result of accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements on leases that terminated during the prior year.\nOur largest clients are U.S. federal government departments and agencies. In fact, our federal government clients have included every cabinet-level department, most significantly HHS, DOS, and DoD. Federal government clients generated approximately 44%, 38%, and 41% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. State and local government clients generated approximately 15%, 19%, and 14% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. International government clients generated approximately 6%, 8%, and 9% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022 Program Implementation Services;\nWe may proceed with work based on client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents. We have a review process for approving any such work. Revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated, and realization is probable. We base our estimates on a variety of factors, including previous experiences with the client, communications with the client regarding funding status, and our knowledge of available funding for the contract.\nWe are required to review other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2020 management evaluated its existing operating lease facilities and elected to discontinue the use of 16 leased facilities in advance of the lease termination date resulting in a $4.9 million charge for early contract termination. The $4.9 million charge included $3.1 million of impairment, $1.5 million of termination fees and $0.3 million of a loss on the disposition of related fixed assets and other costs.\nWe have explored various options of mitigating the risk associated with potential fluctuations in the foreign currencies in which we conduct transactions. We currently have hedges in an amount proportionate to work anticipated to be performed under certain contracts in Europe. We recognize changes in the fair-value of the hedges in our results of operations. We may increase the number, size and scope of our hedges as we analyze options for mitigating our foreign exchange and interest rate risk. The current impact of the foreign currency hedges to the consolidated financial statements is immaterial.\nThese following tables provide reconciliations of financial measures that are not U.S. GAAP ( non-GAAP\u201d) to the most applicable U.S. GAAP measures. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating our financial information, they should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies may define similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently and, accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how we define these measures.\n\u2022 Advisory Services;\nWe also see significant opportunity to further leverage our digital and client engagement capabilities across our commercial and government client base. Our future results will depend on the success of our strategy to enhance our client relationships and seek larger engagements that span the entire program life cycle, and to complete and successfully integrate additional strategic acquisitions. We will continue to focus on building scale in vertical and horizontal domain expertise, developing business with both our government and commercial clients, and replicating our business model in selective geographies. In doing so, we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities, such as our recent acquisition of ITG, that enhance our subject matter knowledge, broaden our service offerings, and/or provide scale in specific geographies. Although we continue to see favorable long-term market opportunities, there are certain business challenges facing all government service providers. Administrative and legislative actions by the federal government to address changing priorities or in response to the budget deficit could have a negative impact on our business, which may result in a reduction to our revenue and profit and adversely affect cash flow. Similarly, the very nature of opportunities arising out of disaster recovery mean they can involve unusual challenges. Factors such as the overall stress on communities and people affected by disaster recovery situations, political complexities and challenges among involved government agencies, and a higher-than-normal risk of audits and investigations may result in a reduction to our revenue and profit and adversely affect cash flow. However, we believe we are well positioned to provide a broad range of services in support of initiatives that will continue to be priorities to the federal government, as well as to state and local and international governments and commercial clients. We believe that the combination of internally generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, potential acquisitions, customary capital expenditures, and other working capital requirements.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 Federal government shutdowns; \n\u2022 Energy, Environment, and Infrastructure;\nOur clients utilize our services because we combine diverse institutional knowledge and experience with the deep subject matter expertise of our highly educated staff, which we deploy in multi-disciplinary teams. We have successfully worked with many of our clients for decades, with the result that we have a thorough and nuanced perspective of their objectives and needs. We serve both governmental and commercial clients. Our government clients include those from departments and agencies of the federal government, state (including territories) and local governments, and international governments. Our government efforts include work performed under subcontract agreements to commercial clients whose ultimate customer is government agencies and departments.\nOperating activities provided $173.1 million in cash for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $91.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash flows provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily due to strong collections of contract receivables related to disaster relief and rebuilding efforts as well as accelerated collections related to our media placements work for which the associated media spend will occur in early 2021. Additionally, we were able to defer employer social security tax liabilities, under the CARES Act, until 2021 and 2022. The increases in cash flows were partially offset by the reduction in net income and the use of cash to settle outstanding operating liabilities. The improved collections of contract receivables is evidenced by the reduction in our DSO from 83 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to 67 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The reduction in our DSO was primarily the result of an 11 day decrease due to the accelerated collection related to media placements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

increases in government and commercial revenue. Government revenue grew 2.3% and commercial revenue grew 1.1%.\n\n- Operating income decreased 12.1% to $89.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019. This was largely due to higher indirect and selling expenses, including expenses related to the Executive Chair's employment agreement, and increased amortization of intangibles, partially offset by higher revenues. \n\n- Net income decreased 20.3% to $55 million in 2020 compared to 2019. This was primarily driven by the decrease in operating income as well as higher interest expense.\n\n- Cash flows from operating activities increased to $173.1 million in 2020 compared to $91.4 million in 2019, driven by strong collections of receivables and the ability to defer employer payroll taxes under the CARES Act. \n\n- The company acquired Incentive Technology Group (ITG) in January 2020 for $255 million, resulting in additions to goodwill and intangibles. \n\n- The company has one reporting segment that provides professional services to government and commercial clients. It serves clients in energy, environment and infrastructure; health, education and social programs; safety and security; and consumer and financial markets.\n\nIn summary, the company saw moderate revenue growth but lower profitability in 2020. Operating cash flows increased significantly due to strong collections. The ITG acquisition expanded capabilities and client access."}
