MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report. Also refer to Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nAs used herein, the terms we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d and Company\u201d refer to Strategic Realty Trust, Inc., and, as required by context, Strategic Realty Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as our operating partnership\u201d or OP\u201d, and to their respective subsidiaries. References to shares\u201d and our common stock\u201d refer to the shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation that was formed on September 18, 2008, to invest in and manage a portfolio of income-producing retail properties, located in the United States, real estate-owning entities and real estate-related assets, including the investment in or origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans related to commercial real estate. During the first quarter of 2016, we also invested, through joint ventures, in two significant retail projects under development, one of which was substantially completed during the year ended December 31, 2020. We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009, and we have operated and intend to continue to operate in such a manner. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations through our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We also own a majority of the outstanding limited partner interests in the operating partnership.\nSince our inception, our business has been managed by an external advisor. We do not have direct employees and all management and administrative personnel responsible for conducting our business are employed by our advisor. Currently we are externally managed and advised by SRT Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Advisor\u201d) pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (the Advisory Agreement\u201d) initially executed on August 10, 2013, and subsequently renewed every year through 2021. The current term of the Advisory Agreement terminates on August 9, 2021. The Advisor is an affiliate of Glenborough, LLC (together with its affiliates, Glenborough\u201d), a privately held full-service real estate investment and management company focused on the acquisition, management and leasing of commercial properties.\nImpact of COVID-19\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused state and local governments to institute quarantines, shelter-in-place rules and restrictions on travel, the types of business that may continue to operate, and the types of construction projects that may continue. California, where the majority of our properties are located, declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 and instituted a shelter-in-place order on March 19, 2020 to reduce the spread of COVID-19. On May 7, 2020, California moved into Stage 2 of its four-stage reopening roadmap, permitting certain sectors of the economy to reopen provided that there were significant safety measures in place. On June 12, 2020, California permitted businesses such as movie theaters, restaurants, wineries, bars, zoos, museums, gyms, fitness centers, hotels, card rooms, racetracks, and campgrounds to re-open. On July 13, 2020, California re-instituted a state-wide closure on many types of businesses that were previously permitted to re-open such as indoor dining, bars, movie theaters, and museums. In August 2020, California moved to a four-tier, color-coded system assigning every county to a tier based on its test positivity and adjusted case rate. San Francisco County, where a number of our properties are located,\nwas assigned a moderate\u201d tier in September 2020, which allows for some indoor business operations to open with modifications. Los Angeles County remains in the widespread\u201d tier, requiring many non-essential indoors business operations to stay closed. On December 6, 2020, due to a significant rise in COVID-19 cases around the Thanksgiving holiday and beyond, as part of California's mitigation measures, both Los Angeles and San Francisco counties went into a regional stay-at-home order. This order implemented restrictions requiring many non-essential indoor business operations to close or stay closed. This order was subsequently lifted effective January 28, 2021, with both counties remaining in the widespread\u201d tier.\nCOVID-19 and the efforts to contain its spread have significantly impacted the global economy, the U.S. economy, the economies of the local markets throughout California in which our properties are predominately located, and the broader financial markets. Nearly every industry has been impacted directly or indirectly, and the U.S. retail market has come under severe pressure due to numerous factors, including preventative measures taken by local, state and federal authorities to alleviate the public health crisis such as mandatory business closures, quarantines, restrictions on travel and shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders. There is uncertainty as to the time, date and extent to which these restrictions will be relaxed, lifted or reinstated, businesses of tenants that have closed, either voluntarily or by mandate, will reopen or when customers will re-engage with tenants as they have in the past. Due to this uncertainty, some of our tenants are experiencing hardships, as they are unable to operate at full capacity.\nWe believe that the COVID-19 outbreak has and could continue to negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to, declines in real estate rental revenues, the inability to sell certain properties at a favorable price, and a decrease in construction and leasing activity. The majority of our tenants have requested rent deferral or rent abatement as a result of the pandemic. At the start of the pandemic and shelter-in-place orders, a majority of our tenants requested rent deferral or rent abatement due to the pandemic and government-mandated restrictions. These tenants initially totaled 94% of the leased square footage in our wholly-owned properties. We reviewed these requests on a case-by-case basis and agreed to modifications to some of the tenant leases, and other leases were not modified. In most cases, it is in our best interest to help our tenants remain in business and reopen when shelter-in-place orders or other mandated closures or restrictions are lifted. If these tenants fail, finding replacement tenants may be costly and time-consuming.\nOf the total leased square footage in our wholly-owned properties, 47% of the leases were either (i) not modified and the tenants were able to continue to make their payments or (ii) the leases were modified to provide for a short-term temporary rent deferral or abatement. The rent deferrals generally were one to two months and were to be repaid within 12 months. Any rent abatement was typically one to two months and in many cases also involved an extension of the tenant's lease. Another 28% of the leases in our wholly-owned properties were modified to provide ongoing rent relief to the tenant. These leases generally were with restaurants and salons that faced significant operating restrictions limiting their ability to be open, open indoors, or open with anything but a limited capacity. These lease modifications involved some combination of lease extensions, application of security deposits, temporary rent deferrals, partial rent forgiveness or abatement, and new percentage rent clauses to protect the landlord in the event sales returned to prior levels during the period of the lease modifications. These concessions lasted and will last in many cases through the first and second quarters of 2021 to allow these businesses to commit to new operating strategies and costs for a pandemic environment. The tenants making up the remaining 25% of our leased square footage requested lease concessions; however, we could not agree with these tenants on lease changes acceptable to both parties. On December 31, 2020, these tenants were in default under their leases; however, we are temporarily unable to evict them under state and local statutes and moratoria. We are working with these tenants to find replacement tenants and terminate their leases. We are in active lease negotiation for 100% of this space.\nTo mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and liquidity, we have taken a number of proactive measures, which include the following:\n\u2022Our Advisor has been able to transition all employees and operations to a remote work environment, beginning on March 16, 2020, and we have been fortunate that our operations have continued successfully during these difficult times.\n\u2022We are in constant communication with our tenants and are assisting tenants in identifying local, state and federal resources that may be available to support their businesses and employees during the pandemic, including stimulus funds that may be available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020.\n\u2022We believe we will be able to service our debts and pay for our ongoing general and administrative expenses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $1.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had approximately $0.8 million of restricted cash (funds held by the lenders for property taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capital expenditures, rollover reserves and other financing needs). Furthermore, the Shops at Turkey Creek remains unencumbered by debt and is available for financing to provide us funds, if needed. Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, Shops at Turkey Creek was listed for sale.\n\u2022We fully paid off the revolving line of credit with the SRT Loan (as defined below) from PFP Holding Company, LLC (the SRT Lender\u201d). The SRT Loan is secured by six of our core urban properties in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The SRT Loan does not have the sort of restrictive covenants and ongoing debt coverage ratios that could trigger a default caused by tenants not paying rent or seeking rent relief (unlike the former line of credit).\n\u2022We remain in compliance with all the terms of the Wilshire Construction Loan (as defined below), which matures on May 10, 2022 with the options to extend for two additional twelve-month periods, subject to certain conditions. Similarly, we remain in compliance with the Sunset & Gardner Loan (as defined below), which matures on October 31, 2021.\n\u2022To further preserve cash and liquidity, we suspended our Amended and Restated Share Redemption Program (the SRP\u201d), such suspension was effective on May 21, 2020. The SRP will remain suspended and no further redemptions will be made unless and until our board of directors (the Board\u201d) approves the resumption of the SRP. During the suspension, we will continue to accept death and qualifying disability redemption filings from stockholders, but will not take any action with regard to those requests until the Board has elected to lift the suspension and provided the terms and conditions for any continuation of the program. In addition, on March 27, 2020, the board of directors decided to suspend the payment of any dividend for the quarter ending March 31, 2020, and will reconsider future dividend payments on a quarter by quarter basis as more information becomes available on the impact of COVID-19 and related impact to us. Dividend payments were not reinstated as of December 31, 2020.\nGiven the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic's near and potential long-term impact on our business, the full extent of the financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. However, there are those who believe that, as more tools are developed to fight COVID-19 - increased testing, enhanced monitoring, data analysis and identification of effective therapeutics-the country can, anchored by advice of healthcare specialists, incrementally foster economic activity in the near term and at some point with a vaccine and time, the country should return to a more normal state as with other pandemics in the past. Although vaccines for COVID-19 are being made available to the general public in the U.S. and around the world, it will take time for the vaccine to materially affect the spread of the virus and the outbreak could have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions.\nMarket Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets\nData from the U.S. Department of Commerce showed total retail sales in 2020 increased 3.4% from 2019. Total e-commerce sales for 2020 were estimated at $791.7 billion, an increase of 32.4% from 2019. E-commerce sales in 2020 accounted for 14.0% of total sales. E-commerce sales in 2019 accounted for 11.0% of total sales.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to major changes in the make-up of the total retail sales figures. Retailers such as grocery stores, home improvement and sporting goods saw strong increases, while traditional department stores, apparel, travel, gas stations and restaurants saw significant declines.\nInvestment sales volumes of retail properties for 2020 fell by 43% as compared to 2019, according to CBRE, and down 52% from the five-year average. CBRE reported strong first quarter 2020 sales then a significant drop in the second quarter as tenant closures and reduced leasing activity led to operating income uncertainty and a restricted lending environment.\nReal estate lending markets remain difficult with retail, office and hotels being the least favored property classes and industrial and multifamily attracting more lender attention. Volumes increased in the fourth quarter from very low levels during the pandemic, however loan-to-value percentages are trending down to lower advance ratios.\nThe retail market ended the year with a vacancy rate of 6.6% up from 6.1% according to CBRE reports, with the fourth quarter net absorption of 7.1 million square feet, the strongest since the start of the pandemic.\nPublicly traded real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d) in the shopping center and mall sectors showed negative returns for 2020 with shopping REITs posting total return losses of 24.2% and malls posting total return losses of 28.9%, while the overall REIT market saw total return losses of 14.9% according to KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n2020 Significant Events\nProperty Disposition and Line of Credit Pay-off\nOn February 10, 2020, we consummated the disposition of Topaz Marketplace, located in Hesperia, California for approximately $10.5 million in cash, a portion of which was used to repay our line of credit in its entirety. The line of credit expired of its own accord on February 15, 2020, with no balance outstanding. As part of the payoff, Shops at Turkey Creek was released from the line of credit.\nShare Redemption under the Share Redemption Program\nIn order to preserve cash in light of the uncertainty relating to the economic impact of COVID-19, our board of directors approved the suspension of the SRP, which offered redemption opportunities only in connection with a stockholder's death or qualifying disability.\nQuarterly Distributions\nOn March 27, 2020, our board of directors voted to suspend the payment of any dividend for the quarter ending March 31, 2020, and to reconsider future dividend payments on a quarter by quarter basis. Dividend payments were not reinstated as of December 31, 2020.\nLoans Secured by Properties Under Development\nOn July 31, 2020, we extended the Sunset & Gardner Loan for an additional twelve-month period under the same terms, with an interest rate of 7.3% per annum. The new maturity date is October 31, 2021.\nReview of our Policies\nOur board of directors, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of our stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that we will be able to successfully maintain and manage our current portfolio of investments and acquire additional income-producing properties and other real estate-related investments in the future; (2) our executive officers, directors and affiliates of our Advisor have expertise with the type of properties in our current portfolio; and (3) to the extent that we acquire additional real properties or other real estate-related investments in the future, the use of leverage should enable us to acquire assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for our stockholders.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues include minimum rents, expense recoveries and percentage rental payments. Minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis over the terms of the related leases on a straight-line basis when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased property. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022whether the lease stipulates how a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;\n\u2022whether the amount of a tenant improvement allowance is in excess of market rates;\n\u2022whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;\n\u2022whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and\n\u2022whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease term.\nFor leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, we recognize income on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis for leases results in reported revenue amounts which differ from those that are contractually due from tenants. If we determine that collectability of straight-line rents is not reasonably assured, we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, establish an allowance for estimated losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease.\nCertain leases contain provisions that require the payment of additional rents based on the respective tenants' sales volume (contingent or percentage rent) and substantially all contain provisions that require reimbursement of the tenants' allocable real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance costs ( CAM\u201d). Revenue based on percentage of tenants' sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds its sales breakpoint. Revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes, CAM and insurance is recognized in the period that the applicable costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreement.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers. As our revenues are primarily generated through leasing arrangements, our revenues fall out of the scope of this standard. Effective January 1, 2018, we applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 610-20, Gains and Losses From the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets ( ASC 610-20\u201d), for gains on sale of real estate, and recognize any gains at the time control of a property is transferred and when it is probable that substantially all of the related consideration will be collected.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 requires entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous guidance. However, the principal difference from previous guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases should be recognized in the statement of financial position. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under ASC Topic 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d). Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using the modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply under ASC Topic 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d). The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2016-02 (as amended by subsequent ASUs) effective January 1, 2019, utilizing the practical expedients described in ASU 2018-11. We elected the lessor practical expedient to not separate common area maintenance and reimbursement of real estate taxes from the associated lease for all existing and new leases as the timing and pattern of payments and associated lease payments are the same. The timing of revenue recognition remains the same for our existing leases and new leases. Revenues related to our leases continue to be reported on one line in the presentation within the statement of operations as a result of electing this lessor practical expedient. We continue to capitalize our direct leasing costs. These costs are incurred as a result of obtaining new leases, and renewing leases, and are paid to our Advisor. Additionally, we are not a lessee of real estate or equipment, as we are externally managed by our Advisor.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nWe evaluate our acquisitions in accordance with ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d) that clarifies the framework for determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities meets the definition of a business. The revised framework establishes a screen for determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities is a business and narrows the definition of a business, which is expected to result in fewer transactions being accounted for as business combinations. Acquisitions of integrated sets of assets and activities that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions.\nBeginning with January 1, 2017, acquisitions were determined to be asset acquisitions, as they did not meet the definition of a business.\nEvaluation of business combination or asset acquisition:\nWe evaluate each acquisition of real estate to determine if the integrated set of assets and activities acquired meet the definition of a business and need to be accounted for as a business combination. If either of the following criteria is met, the integrated set of assets and activities acquired would not qualify as a business:\n\u2022 Substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in either a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; or\n\u2022 The integrated set of assets and activities is lacking, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs (i.e. revenue generated before and after the transaction).\nAn acquired process is considered substantive if:\n\u2022 The process includes an organized workforce (or includes an acquired contract that provides access to an organized workforce), that is skilled, knowledgeable, and experienced in performing the process;\n\u2022 The process cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay; or\n\u2022 The process is considered unique or scarce.\nGenerally, we expect that acquisitions of real estate will not meet the revised definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e. land, buildings, and related intangible assets), or because the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay.\nIn asset acquisitions, the purchase consideration, including acquisition costs, is allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. As a result, asset acquisitions do not result in the recognition of goodwill or a bargain purchase gain.\nDepreciation and amortization is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings and improvements </td> <td>5 - 30 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements </td> <td>1 - 15 years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTenant improvement costs recorded as capital assets are depreciated over the tenant's remaining lease term, which we determined approximates the useful life of the improvement. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized. Acquisition costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized in the consolidated balance sheets.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our investments in real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets through its undiscounted future cash flows (excluding interest) and its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the investments in real estate and related intangible assets. Key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates, capital expenditures, property sales capitalization rates and expected holding period of the property.\nWe evaluate our equity investments for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Securities ( ASC 320\u201d). ASC 320 provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired, whether impairment is other-than-temporary, and measurement of an impairment loss.\nWe recorded an impairment loss during the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $13.4 million related to the development project and the operating property we own through joint ventures, which was included in our consolidated statement of operations in this Annual Report. We did not record any impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d for more information regarding the methodologies used to estimate fair value of the investments in real estate.\nAssets Held for Sale\nWhen certain criteria are met, long-lived assets are classified as held for sale and are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. With the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant, and Equipment on April 30, 2014, only disposed properties that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results are reported as discontinued operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), we are required to measure or disclose certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we are required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n\u2022Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;\n\u2022Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and\n\u2022Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available for inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement.\nWhen available, we utilize quoted market prices or other observable inputs (Level 2 inputs), such as interest rates or yield curves, from independent third-party sources to determine fair value and classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a non-binding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to use significant judgment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third-party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third-party. When we determine the market for an asset owned by us to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, we use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, we measure fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets; or (ii) a present value technique that considers the future cash flows based on contractual obligations discounted by an observed or estimated market rates of comparable liabilities. The use of contractual cash flows with regard to amount and timing significantly reduces the judgment applied in arriving at fair value.\nChanges in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market (1) there are few recent transactions; (2) price quotations are not based on current information; (3) price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example, some brokered markets); (4) indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability; (5) there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with our estimate of expected cash flows, considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability; (6) there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread; (7) there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances (that is, a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities; and (8) little information is released publicly (for example, a principal-to-principal market).\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of non-orderly transactions (1) there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions; (2) there was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant; (3) the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (that is, distressed), or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (that is, forced); and (4) the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal results of operations as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any\ntaxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state or local income taxes and to U.S. Federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken in the consolidated financial statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not\u201d that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.\nWhen necessary, deferred income taxes are recognized in certain taxable entities. Deferred income tax is generally a function of the period's temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes). A valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets is provided if all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance is generally included in deferred income tax expense.\nOur tax returns remain subject to examination and consequently, the taxability of our distributions is subject to change.\nPortfolio Investments\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio included:\n\u2022Investments in two consolidated joint ventures, which own:\n\u25e6a retail property comprising approximately 12,000 square fee of multi-tenant, commercial retail space in the Los Angeles, California area.\n\u25e6a property under development in the Los Angeles, California area that is expected to comprise approximately 100,000 square feet upon completion.\n\u2022Seven retail properties, including one property held for sale and excluding a land parcel, comprising an aggregate of approximately 43,000 square feet of single- and multi-tenant, commercial retail space located in two states.\nResults of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 79% and 90% of our portfolio was leased (based on rentable square footage), respectively, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately 6.3 years and 6.8 years, respectively. In 2020, there was one property disposition. There were no property dispositions in 2019.\nLeasing Information\nExcluding the property held for sale, there were no new leases added in our retail properties during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The following table provides information regarding our leasing activity, excluding leasing activity in held for sale property, for the year ended December 31, 2020 for properties we held as of December 31, 2020.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Vacant\nRentable\nSq.

Additionally, rent concessions provided to our tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the decrease in revenue compared to the same period in 2019.\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nOperating and maintenance expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to higher bad debt reserves. Additionally, placement of the Wilshire Property in service in August 2020, contributed to the increase in operating and maintenance expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower legal and tax compliance fees.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses stayed flat during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to classification of Topaz Marketplace as held for sale during the three months ended September, 2019, and subsequent sale in February 2020, as well as the classification of Shops at Turkey Creek as held for sale during the three months ended December 31, 2020. This was partially offset by the placement of the Wilshire Property in service in August 2020.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, due to the placement of the Wilshire Property in service. Capitalization of interest expense related to the Wilshire Property construction loan ceased in August 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of deferred loan fees.\nLoss on impairment of real estate and property under development\nLoss on impairment of approximately $13.4 million related to an operating property and a development project we own through joint ventures.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2020, consisted of a gain on sale of Topaz Marketplace of approximately $0.9 million. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of approximately $1.4 million related to the gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, primarily consisted of various state tax payments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, our principal demand for funds has been for the acquisition of real estate, the payment of operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, the payment of distributions to our stockholders and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and development properties. On February 7, 2013, we ceased offering shares of our common stock in our primary offering and under our distribution reinvestment plan. As a result of the termination of our initial public offering, offering proceeds from the sale of our securities are not currently available to fund our cash needs. We have used and expect to continue to use debt financing, net sales proceeds and cash flow from operations to fund our cash needs.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.8 million and we had $0.8 million of restricted cash (funds held by the lenders for property taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capital expenditures, rollover reserves and other financing needs).\nOur aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended, which we refer to as our charter,\u201d we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets. Net assets for purposes of this calculation is defined to be our total assets (other than intangibles), valued at cost prior to deducting depreciation, reserves for bad debts and other non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. However, we may temporarily borrow in excess of these amounts if such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with an explanation for such excess. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our borrowings were approximately 90.1% and 75.1%, respectively, of the carrying value of our net assets.\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,295) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,099) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>2,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,435) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,540 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>(5,429) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,954) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,619) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe change in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to lower operating income during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, which resulted from sale of Topaz Marketplace during the three months ended March 31, 2020, as well as an increase in accounts receivable balance during the year due to rent deferrals and lower rent collections.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of approximately $9.9 million of proceeds from sale of Topaz Marketplace, which were partially offset by our aggregate additional $6.9 million investment in the Wilshire and Sunset and Gardner Joint Ventures.\nCash flows used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of approximately $4.9 million of our investments in the Wilshire and Sunset and Gardner Joint Ventures. These were partially offset by proceeds of approximately $4.2 million from the sale of our unconsolidated joint venture interests.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash flows used by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisted of approximately $8.9 million in repayments of our line of credit. This was partially offset by approximately $4.0 million from construction loan proceeds.\nCash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of approximately $39.5 million from loan proceeds and draws on our line of credit. This was partially offset by repayment of our debt balances of approximately $30.2 million, our quarterly dividend payments of approximately $2.7 million, and redemptions of our common stock of approximately $0.7 million.\nShort-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal short-term demand for funds is for the payment of operating expenses and the payment on our outstanding indebtedness. To date, our cash needs for operations have been funded by cash provided by property operations, the sales of properties and the sale of shares of our common stock. We may fund our short-term operating cash needs from operations, from the sales of properties and from debt.\nLong-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn a long-term basis, our principal demand for funds will be for real estate and real estate-related investments and the payment of acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions to stockholders, future redemptions of shares and interest and principal payments on current and future indebtedness. Generally, we intend to meet cash needs for items other than acquisitions and acquisition-related expenses from our cash flow from operations, debt and sales of properties. On a long-term basis, we expect that substantially all cash generated from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after satisfying our operating expenses including interest and principal payments. We may consider future public offerings or private placements of equity. Refer to Note 7. Notes Payable, Net\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the maturity dates and terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\nOur ability to access capital on favorable terms as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our liquidity needs could be affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our rental revenue and, as a result, future cash from operations cannot be determined at present.\nThe Shops at Turkey Creek remains unencumbered by debt and is available for financing to provide us funds, if needed. Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, Shops at Turkey Creek was listed for sale.\nOn March 3, 2021, we obtained a $2.5 million Standby Loan Commitment (the Loan\u201d) from Glenborough Property Partners, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor. If we elect to act on the Standby Commitment, the Loan would have a term of 12 months with an interest rate of 7.0% per annum, payable monthly. We would have the right to prepay or repay the Loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty. There are no other loan fees or financing coordination fees paid or payable in connection with this loan. The Loan would be secured by first deed of trust on Shops at Turkey Creek.\nWe believe that our cash on hand, along with other potential aforementioned sources of liquidity that we may be able to obtain, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, as well as our capital lease and debt obligations for at least the next twelve months and beyond. However, there can be no guarantee that we will be successful with its plan.\nRecent Financing Transactions\nMulti-Property Secured Financing\nOn December 24, 2019, we entered into a Loan Agreement (the SRT Loan Agreement\u201d) with PFP Holding Company, LLC (the SRT Lender\u201d) for a non-recourse secured loan (the SRT Loan\u201d).\nThe SRT Loan is secured by first deeds of trust on our five San Francisco assets (Fulton Shops, 8 Octavia, 400 Grove, 450 Hayes and 388 Fulton Street) as well as our Silverlake Collection located in Los Angeles. Proceeds from the SRT Loan were used by us to pay down our credit facility and in connection with such payment, the properties referenced above were released from liens related to that credit facility. The SRT Loan matures on January 9, 2023. We have an option to extend the term of the loan for two additional twelve-month periods, subject to the satisfaction of certain covenants and conditions contained in the SRT Loan Agreement. We have the right to prepay the SRT Loan in whole at any time or in part from time to time, subject to the payment of yield maintenance payments if such prepayment occurs in the first 18 months of the loan term, calculated through the 18th monthly payment date, as well as certain expenses, costs or liabilities potentially incurred by the SRT Lender\nas a result of the prepayment and subject to certain other conditions contained in the loan documents. Individual properties may be released from the SRT Loan collateral in connection with bona fide third-party sales, subject to compliance with certain covenants and conditions contained in the SRT Loan Agreement. Any prepayment or repayment on or before the first 12 months of the loan term in connection with a bona fide third-party sale of a property securing the SRT Loan shall only require the payment of yield maintenance payments calculated through the 12th monthly payment date.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the SRT Loan had a principal balance of approximately $18.0 million. The SRT Loan is a floating LIBOR rate loan which bears interest at 30-day LIBOR (with a floor of 1.50%) plus 2.80%. The default rate is equal to 5% above the rate that otherwise would be in effect. Monthly payments are interest-only with the entire principal balance and all outstanding interest due at maturity.\nPursuant to the SRT Loan, we must comply with certain matters contained in the loan documents including but not limited to, (i) requirements to deliver audited and unaudited financial statements, SEC filings, tax returns, pro forma budgets, and quarterly compliance certificates, and (ii) minimum limits on our liquidity and tangible net worth. The SRT Loan contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, covenants with respect to maintenance of properties and insurance, compliance with laws and environmental matters, covenants limiting or prohibiting the creation of liens, and transactions with affiliates.\nIn connection with the SRT Loan, we executed customary non-recourse carveout and environmental guaranties, together with limited additional assurances with regard to the condominium structures of the San Francisco assets.\nLoans Secured by Properties\nOn May 7, 2019, we refinanced and repaid our financing with Loan Oak Fund, LLC with a new construction loan from ReadyCap Commercial, LLC (the Lender\u201d) (the Wilshire Construction Loan\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the Wilshire Construction Loan had a principal balance of approximately $12.5 million, with future funding availability up to a total of approximately $13.9 million, and bears an interest rate of 1-month LIBOR plus an interest margin of 4.25% per annum, payable monthly. The Wilshire Construction Loan is scheduled to mature on May 10, 2022, with options to extend for two additional twelve-month periods, subject to certain conditions as stated in the loan agreement. The Wilshire Construction Loan is secured by a first Deed of Trust on the Wilshire Property. We executed a guaranty that guaranties that the loan interest reserve amounts are kept in compliance with the terms of the loan agreement. The Lender also required that a principal in the upstream owner of our joint venture partner in the Wilshire Joint Venture (the Guarantor\u201d), guarantees performance of borrower's obligations under the loan agreement with respect to the completion of capital improvements to the property. We executed an Indemnity Agreement in favor of the Guarantor against liability under that completion guaranty except to the extent caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, as well as for liabilities incurred under the Environmental Indemnity Agreement executed by the Guarantor in favor of the Lender. We used working capital funds of approximately $3.1 million to repay the difference between the Wilshire Construction Loan initial advance and the prior loan, to pay transaction costs, as well as to fund certain required interest and construction reserves.\nLoans Secured by Properties Under Development\nOn October 29, 2018, we entered into a loan agreement with Lone Oak Fund, LLC (the Sunset & Gardner Loan\u201d). The Sunset & Gardner Loan has a principal balance of approximately $8.7 million, and had an interest rate of 6.9% per annum. The original Sunset & Gardner Loan agreement matured on October 31, 2019. We extended the Sunset & Gardner Loan for an additional twelve-month period under the same terms, with an interest rate of 6.5% per annum. On July 31, 2020, we extended the Sunset & Gardner Loan for an additional twelve-month period under the same terms, with an interest rate of 7.3% per annum. The new maturity date is October 31, 2021. The Sunset & Gardner Loan is secured by a first Deed of Trust on the Sunset & Gardner Property.\nLine of Credit\nOn February 10, 2020, we used proceeds from the sale of Topaz Marketplace to repay the line of credit in its entirety. The line of credit expired of its own accord on February 15, 2020, with no balance outstanding. As part of the payoff, Shops at Turkey Creek was released from the line of credit.\nEffective January 8, 2020, we elected to permanently reduce the maximum aggregate commitment under its line of credit from $30.0 million to $10.5 million. All other terms of the credit facility remained the same.\nGuidelines on Total Operating Expenses\nWe reimburse our Advisor for some expenses paid or incurred by our Advisor in connection with the services provided to us, except that we will not reimburse our Advisor for any amount by which our total operating expenses at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceed the greater of (1) 2% of our average invested assets, as defined in our charter; and (2) 25% of our net income, as defined in our charter, or the 2%/25% Guidelines\u201d unless a majority of our independent directors\ndetermines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total operating expenses did not exceed the 2%/25% Guidelines.\nOn August 2, 2018, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Advisory Agreement. The Advisory Agreement Amendment provides that the Advisor shall not be required to reimburse to us any operating expenses incurred during a given period that exceed the applicable limit on Total Operating Expenses\u201d (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) to the extent that such excess operating expenses are incurred as a result of certain unusual and non-recurring factors approved by our board of directors, including some related to the execution of our investment strategy as directed by our board of directors. These provisions were also included in the Eighth Amendment to the Advisory Agreement entered into July 30, 2020.\nInflation\nThe majority of our leases at our properties contain inflation protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for common area maintenance charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per square foot allowance. We expect to include similar provisions in our future tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases, as well as rents received from acquired leases, may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market rates.\nREIT Compliance\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which our REIT qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nQuarterly Distributions\nAs set forth above, in order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. Our board of directors will continue to evaluate the amount of future quarterly distributions based on our operational cash needs.\nSome or all of our distributions have been paid, and in the future may continue to be paid, from sources other than cash flows from operations.\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on the economy and the related future uncertainty, on March 27, 2020, our board of directors decided to suspend the payment of any dividend for the quarters ending March 31, 2020, and to reconsider future dividend payments on a quarter by quarter basis as more information becomes available on the impact of COVID-19 and related impact to the Company. Dividend payments were not reinstated as of December 31, 2020\nFor a presentation of our quarterly distributions declared and paid to our common stockholders and holders of our common units, refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d\nFunds From Operations\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of a real estate company's operating performance. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT\u201d, an industry trade group, has promulgated this supplemental performance measure and defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures (adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.) It is important to note that not only is FFO not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, it also does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or our ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of distributions.\nWe consider FFO to be a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance and one that is an appropriate supplemental disclosure for an equity REIT due to its widespread acceptance and use within the REIT and analyst communities. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.\nOur calculation of FFO attributable to common shares and Common Units and the reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO is as follows (amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,508) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(947) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment to reflect FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of in-place leases and leasing costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>290 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on impairment of real estate and property under development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common shares and Common Units (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,691) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,786 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO per share and Common Unit (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.15) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares and units outstanding (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,962,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,049,317 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Our common units have the right to convert a unit into common stock for a one-to-one conversion.

These carve-out guarantees do not represent a liability of the partners other than carve-out guarantees for certain matters such as environmental conditions, misuse of funds and material misrepresentations. We have retained certain rights of recovery in connection with these carve-out guarantees.

The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT\u201d, an industry trade group, has promulgated this supplemental performance measure and defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures (adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.) It is important to note that not only is FFO not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, it also does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or our ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of distributions.\n\u25e6a property under development in the Los Angeles, California area that is expected to comprise approximately 100,000 square feet upon completion.\ntaxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state or local income taxes and to U.S. Federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nGuidelines on Total Operating Expenses\n2020 Significant Events\nQuarterly Distributions\nSince our inception, our principal demand for funds has been for the acquisition of real estate, the payment of operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, the payment of distributions to our stockholders and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and development properties. On February 7, 2013, we ceased offering shares of our common stock in our primary offering and under our distribution reinvestment plan. As a result of the termination of our initial public offering, offering proceeds from the sale of our securities are not currently available to fund our cash needs. We have used and expect to continue to use debt financing, net sales proceeds and cash flow from operations to fund our cash needs.\n\nReview of our Policies\nSubsequent Events\nMulti-Property Secured Financing\nas a result of the prepayment and subject to certain other conditions contained in the loan documents. Individual properties may be released from the SRT Loan collateral in connection with bona fide third-party sales, subject to compliance with certain covenants and conditions contained in the SRT Loan Agreement. Any prepayment or repayment on or before the first 12 months of the loan term in connection with a bona fide third-party sale of a property securing the SRT Loan shall only require the payment of yield maintenance payments calculated through the 12th monthly payment date.\nThe following table provides summary information about our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of carve-out guarantees in connection with one of our previous investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as described in the consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These carve-out guarantees do not represent a liability of the partners other than carve-out guarantees for certain matters such as environmental conditions, misuse of funds and material misrepresentations. We have retained certain rights of recovery in connection with these carve-out guarantees. As of February 2021, all of the related loans were repaid in full.\nOn May 7, 2019, we refinanced and repaid our financing with Loan Oak Fund, LLC with a new construction loan from ReadyCap Commercial, LLC (the Lender\u201d) (the Wilshire Construction Loan\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the Wilshire Construction Loan had a principal balance of approximately $12.5 million, with future funding availability up to a total of approximately $13.9 million, and bears an interest rate of 1-month LIBOR plus an interest margin of 4.25% per annum, payable monthly. The Wilshire Construction Loan is scheduled to mature on May 10, 2022, with options to extend for two additional twelve-month periods, subject to certain conditions as stated in the loan agreement. The Wilshire Construction Loan is secured by a first Deed of Trust on the Wilshire Property. We executed a guaranty that guaranties that the loan interest reserve amounts are kept in compliance with the terms of the loan agreement. The Lender also required that a principal in the upstream owner of our joint venture partner in the Wilshire Joint Venture (the Guarantor\u201d), guarantees performance of borrower's obligations under the loan agreement with respect to the completion of capital improvements to the property. We executed an Indemnity Agreement in favor of the Guarantor against liability under that completion guaranty except to the extent caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, as well as for liabilities incurred under the Environmental Indemnity Agreement executed by the Guarantor in favor of the Lender. We used working capital funds of approximately $3.1 million to repay the difference between the Wilshire Construction Loan initial advance and the prior loan, to pay transaction costs, as well as to fund certain required interest and construction reserves.\nWe evaluate our acquisitions in accordance with ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d) that clarifies the framework for determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities meets the definition of a business. The revised framework establishes a screen for determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities is a business and narrows the definition of a business, which is expected to result in fewer transactions being accounted for as business combinations. Acquisitions of integrated sets of assets and activities that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions.\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of non-orderly transactions (1) there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions; (2) there was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant; (3) the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (that is, distressed), or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (that is, forced); and (4) the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities.\n\u2022 The process is considered unique or scarce.\n\u2022Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on the economy and the related future uncertainty, on March 27, 2020, our board of directors decided to suspend the payment of any dividend for the quarters ending March 31, 2020, and to reconsider future dividend payments on a quarter by quarter basis as more information becomes available on the impact of COVID-19 and related impact to the Company. Dividend payments were not reinstated as of December 31, 2020\nOn March 3, 2021, we obtained a $2.5 million Standby Loan Commitment (the Loan\u201d) from Glenborough Property Partners, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor. If we elect to act on the Standby Commitment, the Loan would have a term of 12 months with an interest rate of 7.0% per annum, payable monthly. We would have the right to prepay or repay the Loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty. There are no other loan fees or financing coordination fees paid or payable in connection with this loan. The Loan would be secured by first deed of trust on Shops at Turkey Creek.\n\u2022Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available for inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement.\nOther Events\nCash flows provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of approximately $9.9 million of proceeds from sale of Topaz Marketplace, which were partially offset by our aggregate additional $6.9 million investment in the Wilshire and Sunset and Gardner Joint Ventures.\nInvestment sales volumes of retail properties for 2020 fell by 43% as compared to 2019, according to CBRE, and down 52% from the five-year average. CBRE reported strong first quarter 2020 sales then a significant drop in the second quarter as tenant closures and reduced leasing activity led to operating income uncertainty and a restricted lending environment.\n\u2022 The process cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay; or\nInflation\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 requires entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous guidance. However, the principal difference from previous guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases should be recognized in the statement of financial position. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under ASC Topic 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d). Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using the modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply under ASC Topic 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d). The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2016-02 (as amended by subsequent ASUs) effective January 1, 2019, utilizing the practical expedients described in ASU 2018-11. We elected the lessor practical expedient to not separate common area maintenance and reimbursement of real estate taxes from the associated lease for all existing and new leases as the timing and pattern of payments and associated lease payments are the same. The timing of revenue recognition remains the same for our existing leases and new leases. Revenues related to our leases continue to be reported on one line in the presentation within the statement of operations as a result of electing this lessor practical expedient. We continue to capitalize our direct leasing costs. These costs are incurred as a result of obtaining new leases, and renewing leases, and are paid to our Advisor. Additionally, we are not a lessee of real estate or equipment, as we are externally managed by our Advisor.\nOn March 27, 2020, our board of directors voted to suspend the payment of any dividend for the quarter ending March 31, 2020, and to reconsider future dividend payments on a quarter by quarter basis. Dividend payments were not reinstated as of December 31, 2020.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nOther income, net\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nCash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of approximately $39.5 million from loan proceeds and draws on our line of credit. This was partially offset by repayment of our debt balances of approximately $30.2 million, our quarterly dividend payments of approximately $2.7 million, and redemptions of our common stock of approximately $0.7 million.\nWhen necessary, deferred income taxes are recognized in certain taxable entities. Deferred income tax is generally a function of the period's temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes). A valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets is provided if all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance is generally included in deferred income tax expense.\nWhen certain criteria are met, long-lived assets are classified as held for sale and are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. With the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant, and Equipment on April 30, 2014, only disposed properties that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results are reported as discontinued operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe evaluate tax positions taken in the consolidated financial statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not\u201d that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.\nWe consider FFO to be a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance and one that is an appropriate supplemental disclosure for an equity REIT due to its widespread acceptance and use within the REIT and analyst communities. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.\n\u2022whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSince our inception, our business has been managed by an external advisor. We do not have direct employees and all management and administrative personnel responsible for conducting our business are employed by our advisor. Currently we are externally managed and advised by SRT Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Advisor\u201d) pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (the Advisory Agreement\u201d) initially executed on August 10, 2013, and subsequently renewed every year through 2021. The current term of the Advisory Agreement terminates on August 9, 2021. The Advisor is an affiliate of Glenborough, LLC (together with its affiliates, Glenborough\u201d), a privately held full-service real estate investment and management company focused on the acquisition, management and leasing of commercial properties.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe SRT Loan is secured by first deeds of trust on our five San Francisco assets (Fulton Shops, 8 Octavia, 400 Grove, 450 Hayes and 388 Fulton Street) as well as our Silverlake Collection located in Los Angeles. Proceeds from the SRT Loan were used by us to pay down our credit facility and in connection with such payment, the properties referenced above were released from liens related to that credit facility. The SRT Loan matures on January 9, 2023. We have an option to extend the term of the loan for two additional twelve-month periods, subject to the satisfaction of certain covenants and conditions contained in the SRT Loan Agreement. We have the right to prepay the SRT Loan in whole at any time or in part from time to time, subject to the payment of yield maintenance payments if such prepayment occurs in the first 18 months of the loan term, calculated through the 18th monthly payment date, as well as certain expenses, costs or liabilities potentially incurred by the SRT Lender\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio included:\nOur ability to access capital on favorable terms as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our liquidity needs could be affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our rental revenue and, as a result, future cash from operations cannot be determined at present.\nOn March 3, 2021, SRT Advisor, LLC, the Advisor of Strategic Realty Trust and an affiliate of Glenborough, LLC, has notified the Board of Directors of Strategic Realty Trust, Inc. of its consolidation with PUR SRT Advisors LLC, an affiliate of PUR Management LLC, which is an affiliate of L3 Capital, LLC. L3 Capital is a real estate investment firm focused on institutional quality, value-add, prime urban retail and mixed-use investment within first tier U.S. metropolitan markets.\nOperating and maintenance expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to higher bad debt reserves. Additionally, placement of the Wilshire Property in service in August 2020, contributed to the increase in operating and maintenance expenses.\nInvestments in Real Estate\n\nCash flows used by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisted of approximately $8.9 million in repayments of our line of credit. This was partially offset by approximately $4.0 million from construction loan proceeds.\nLoans Secured by Properties\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which our REIT qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nIn order to preserve cash in light of the uncertainty relating to the economic impact of COVID-19, our board of directors approved the suspension of the SRP, which offered redemption opportunities only in connection with a stockholder's death or qualifying disability.\nIn connection with the SRT Loan, we executed customary non-recourse carveout and environmental guaranties, together with limited additional assurances with regard to the condominium structures of the San Francisco assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.8 million and we had $0.8 million of restricted cash (funds held by the lenders for property taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capital expenditures, rollover reserves and other financing needs).\nThe retail market ended the year with a vacancy rate of 6.6% up from 6.1% according to CBRE reports, with the fourth quarter net absorption of 7.1 million square feet, the strongest since the start of the pandemic.\nExcluding the property held for sale, there were no new leases added in our retail properties during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The following table provides information regarding our leasing activity, excluding leasing activity in held for sale property, for the year ended December 31, 2020 for properties we held as of December 31, 2020.\nWe evaluate each acquisition of real estate to determine if the integrated set of assets and activities acquired meet the definition of a business and need to be accounted for as a business combination. If either of the following criteria is met, the integrated set of assets and activities acquired would not qualify as a business:\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers. As our revenues are primarily generated through leasing arrangements, our revenues fall out of the scope of this standard. Effective January 1, 2018, we applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 610-20, Gains and Losses From the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets ( ASC 610-20\u201d), for gains on sale of real estate, and recognize any gains at the time control of a property is transferred and when it is probable that substantially all of the related consideration will be collected.\nRevenue\nOur calculation of FFO attributable to common shares and Common Units and the reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO is as follows (amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts):\nLong-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that the COVID-19 outbreak has and could continue to negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to, declines in real estate rental revenues, the inability to sell certain properties at a favorable price, and a decrease in construction and leasing activity. The majority of our tenants have requested rent deferral or rent abatement as a result of the pandemic. At the start of the pandemic and shelter-in-place orders, a majority of our tenants requested rent deferral or rent abatement due to the pandemic and government-mandated restrictions. These tenants initially totaled 94% of the leased square footage in our wholly-owned properties. We reviewed these requests on a case-by-case basis and agreed to modifications to some of the tenant leases, and other leases were not modified. In most cases, it is in our best interest to help our tenants remain in business and reopen when shelter-in-place orders or other mandated closures or restrictions are lifted. If these tenants fail, finding replacement tenants may be costly and time-consuming.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nCertain leases contain provisions that require the payment of additional rents based on the respective tenants' sales volume (contingent or percentage rent) and substantially all contain provisions that require reimbursement of the tenants' allocable real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance costs ( CAM\u201d). Revenue based on percentage of tenants' sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds its sales breakpoint. Revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes, CAM and insurance is recognized in the period that the applicable costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreement.\nOn July 31, 2020, we extended the Sunset & Gardner Loan for an additional twelve-month period under the same terms, with an interest rate of 7.3% per annum. The new maturity date is October 31, 2021.\nOn December 24, 2019, we entered into a Loan Agreement (the SRT Loan Agreement\u201d) with PFP Holding Company, LLC (the SRT Lender\u201d) for a non-recourse secured loan (the SRT Loan\u201d).\nPursuant to the SRT Loan, we must comply with certain matters contained in the loan documents including but not limited to, (i) requirements to deliver audited and unaudited financial statements, SEC filings, tax returns, pro forma budgets, and quarterly compliance certificates, and (ii) minimum limits on our liquidity and tangible net worth. The SRT Loan contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, covenants with respect to maintenance of properties and insurance, compliance with laws and environmental matters, covenants limiting or prohibiting the creation of liens, and transactions with affiliates.\nOn a long-term basis, our principal demand for funds will be for real estate and real estate-related investments and the payment of acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions to stockholders, future redemptions of shares and interest and principal payments on current and future indebtedness. Generally, we intend to meet cash needs for items other than acquisitions and acquisition-related expenses from our cash flow from operations, debt and sales of properties. On a long-term basis, we expect that substantially all cash generated from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after satisfying our operating expenses including interest and principal payments. We may consider future public offerings or private placements of equity. Refer to Note 7. Notes Payable, Net\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the maturity dates and terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\nGenerally, we expect that acquisitions of real estate will not meet the revised definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e. land, buildings, and related intangible assets), or because the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay.\nInterest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, due to the placement of the Wilshire Property in service. Capitalization of interest expense related to the Wilshire Property construction loan ceased in August 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of deferred loan fees.\nLoans Secured by Properties Under Development\ndetermines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total operating expenses did not exceed the 2%/25% Guidelines.\nAssets Held for Sale\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our investments in real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets through its undiscounted future cash flows (excluding interest) and its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the investments in real estate and related intangible assets. Key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates, capital expenditures, property sales capitalization rates and expected holding period of the property.\nDepreciation and amortization is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\u2022We fully paid off the revolving line of credit with the SRT Loan (as defined below) from PFP Holding Company, LLC (the SRT Lender\u201d). The SRT Loan is secured by six of our core urban properties in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The SRT Loan does not have the sort of restrictive covenants and ongoing debt coverage ratios that could trigger a default caused by tenants not paying rent or seeking rent relief (unlike the former line of credit).\nIncome taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, primarily consisted of various state tax payments.\nThe Shops at Turkey Creek remains unencumbered by debt and is available for financing to provide us funds, if needed. Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, Shops at Turkey Creek was listed for sale.\nWe evaluate our equity investments for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Securities ( ASC 320\u201d). ASC 320 provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired, whether impairment is other-than-temporary, and measurement of an impairment loss.\nOn February 10, 2020, we used proceeds from the sale of Topaz Marketplace to repay the line of credit in its entirety. The line of credit expired of its own accord on February 15, 2020, with no balance outstanding. As part of the payoff, Shops at Turkey Creek was released from the line of credit.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn October 29, 2018, we entered into a loan agreement with Lone Oak Fund, LLC (the Sunset & Gardner Loan\u201d). The Sunset & Gardner Loan has a principal balance of approximately $8.7 million, and had an interest rate of 6.9% per annum. The original Sunset & Gardner Loan agreement matured on October 31, 2019. We extended the Sunset & Gardner Loan for an additional twelve-month period under the same terms, with an interest rate of 6.5% per annum. On July 31, 2020, we extended the Sunset & Gardner Loan for an additional twelve-month period under the same terms, with an interest rate of 7.3% per annum. The new maturity date is October 31, 2021. The Sunset & Gardner Loan is secured by a first Deed of Trust on the Sunset & Gardner Property.\nOn February 10, 2020, we consummated the disposition of Topaz Marketplace, located in Hesperia, California for approximately $10.5 million in cash, a portion of which was used to repay our line of credit in its entirety. The line of credit expired of its own accord on February 15, 2020, with no balance outstanding. As part of the payoff, Shops at Turkey Creek was released from the line of credit.\nThe majority of our leases at our properties contain inflation protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for common area maintenance charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per square foot allowance. We expect to include similar provisions in our future tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases, as well as rents received from acquired leases, may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market rates.\nTenant improvement costs recorded as capital assets are depreciated over the tenant's remaining lease term, which we determined approximates the useful life of the improvement. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized. Acquisition costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\u2022 Substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in either a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; or\nwas assigned a moderate\u201d tier in September 2020, which allows for some indoor business operations to open with modifications. Los Angeles County remains in the widespread\u201d tier, requiring many non-essential indoors business operations to stay closed. On December 6, 2020, due to a significant rise in COVID-19 cases around the Thanksgiving holiday and beyond, as part of California's mitigation measures, both Los Angeles and San Francisco counties went into a regional stay-at-home order. This order implemented restrictions requiring many non-essential indoor business operations to close or stay closed. This order was subsequently lifted effective January 28, 2021, with both counties remaining in the widespread\u201d tier.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 79% and 90% of our portfolio was leased (based on rentable square footage), respectively, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately 6.3 years and 6.8 years, respectively. In 2020, there was one property disposition. There were no property dispositions in 2019.\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to the sale of Topaz Marketplace in February 2020, which accounted for approximately $0.9 million of the total decrease in revenue. Additionally, rent concessions provided to our tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the decrease in revenue compared to the same period in 2019.\nMarket Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets\nREIT Compliance\nResults of Operations\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused state and local governments to institute quarantines, shelter-in-place rules and restrictions on travel, the types of business that may continue to operate, and the types of construction projects that may continue. California, where the majority of our properties are located, declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 and instituted a shelter-in-place order on March 19, 2020 to reduce the spread of COVID-19. On May 7, 2020, California moved into Stage 2 of its four-stage reopening roadmap, permitting certain sectors of the economy to reopen provided that there were significant safety measures in place. On June 12, 2020, California permitted businesses such as movie theaters, restaurants, wineries, bars, zoos, museums, gyms, fitness centers, hotels, card rooms, racetracks, and campgrounds to re-open. On July 13, 2020, California re-instituted a state-wide closure on many types of businesses that were previously permitted to re-open such as indoor dining, bars, movie theaters, and museums. In August 2020, California moved to a four-tier, color-coded system assigning every county to a tier based on its test positivity and adjusted case rate. San Francisco County, where a number of our properties are located,\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nShare Redemption under the Share Redemption Program\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\n\u2022whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;\nOur principal short-term demand for funds is for the payment of operating expenses and the payment on our outstanding indebtedness. To date, our cash needs for operations have been funded by cash provided by property operations, the sales of properties and the sale of shares of our common stock. We may fund our short-term operating cash needs from operations, from the sales of properties and from debt.\nReal estate lending markets remain difficult with retail, office and hotels being the least favored property classes and industrial and multifamily attracting more lender attention. Volumes increased in the fourth quarter from very low levels during the pandemic, however loan-to-value percentages are trending down to lower advance ratios.\n\nEffective January 8, 2020, we elected to permanently reduce the maximum aggregate commitment under its line of credit from $30.0 million to $10.5 million. All other terms of the credit facility remained the same.\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease.\nOur tax returns remain subject to examination and consequently, the taxability of our distributions is subject to change.\n\u2022Investments in two consolidated joint ventures, which own:\nOur aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended, which we refer to as our charter,\u201d we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets. Net assets for purposes of this calculation is defined to be our total assets (other than intangibles), valued at cost prior to deducting depreciation, reserves for bad debts and other non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. However, we may temporarily borrow in excess of these amounts if such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with an explanation for such excess. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our borrowings were approximately 90.1% and 75.1%, respectively, of the carrying value of our net assets.\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2020, consisted of a gain on sale of Topaz Marketplace of approximately $0.9 million. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of approximately $1.4 million related to the gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests.\n\u2022We remain in compliance with all the terms of the Wilshire Construction Loan (as defined below), which matures on May 10, 2022 with the options to extend for two additional twelve-month periods, subject to certain conditions. Similarly, we remain in compliance with the Sunset & Gardner Loan (as defined below), which matures on October 31, 2021.\n\u2022We believe we will be able to service our debts and pay for our ongoing general and administrative expenses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $1.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had approximately $0.8 million of restricted cash (funds held by the lenders for property taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capital expenditures, rollover reserves and other financing needs). Furthermore, the Shops at Turkey Creek remains unencumbered by debt and is available for financing to provide us funds, if needed. Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, Shops at Turkey Creek was listed for sale.\nMortgage Financing\nWe are a Maryland corporation that was formed on September 18, 2008, to invest in and manage a portfolio of income-producing retail properties, located in the United States, real estate-owning entities and real estate-related assets, including the investment in or origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans related to commercial real estate. During the first quarter of 2016, we also invested, through joint ventures, in two significant retail projects under development, one of which was substantially completed during the year ended December 31, 2020. We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009, and we have operated and intend to continue to operate in such a manner. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations through our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We also own a majority of the outstanding limited partner interests in the operating partnership.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market (1) there are few recent transactions; (2) price quotations are not based on current information; (3) price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example, some brokered markets); (4) indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability; (5) there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with our estimate of expected cash flows, considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability; (6) there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread; (7) there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances (that is, a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities; and (8) little information is released publicly (for example, a principal-to-principal market).\nEvaluation of business combination or asset acquisition:\nAn acquired process is considered substantive if:\n\nTo mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and liquidity, we have taken a number of proactive measures, which include the following:\nFunds From Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to major changes in the make-up of the total retail sales figures. Retailers such as grocery stores, home improvement and sporting goods saw strong increases, while traditional department stores, apparel, travel, gas stations and restaurants saw significant declines.\n\u2022whether the lease stipulates how a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;\n(1)Our common units have the right to convert a unit into common stock for a one-to-one conversion. Therefore, we are including the related non-controlling interest income/loss attributable to common units in the computation of FFO and including the common units together with weighted average shares outstanding for the computation of FFO per share and common unit.\nGiven the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic's near and potential long-term impact on our business, the full extent of the financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. However, there are those who believe that, as more tools are developed to fight COVID-19 - increased testing, enhanced monitoring, data analysis and identification of effective therapeutics-the country can, anchored by advice of healthcare specialists, incrementally foster economic activity in the near term and at some point with a vaccine and time, the country should return to a more normal state as with other pandemics in the past. Although vaccines for COVID-19 are being made available to the general public in the U.S. and around the world, it will take time for the vaccine to materially affect the spread of the virus and the outbreak could have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions.\n\u2022Our Advisor has been able to transition all employees and operations to a remote work environment, beginning on March 16, 2020, and we have been fortunate that our operations have continued successfully during these difficult times.\nOn August 2, 2018, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Advisory Agreement. The Advisory Agreement Amendment provides that the Advisor shall not be required to reimburse to us any operating expenses incurred during a given period that exceed the applicable limit on Total Operating Expenses\u201d (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) to the extent that such excess operating expenses are incurred as a result of certain unusual and non-recurring factors approved by our board of directors, including some related to the execution of our investment strategy as directed by our board of directors. These provisions were also included in the Eighth Amendment to the Advisory Agreement entered into July 30, 2020.\nOverview\nWhen available, we utilize quoted market prices or other observable inputs (Level 2 inputs), such as interest rates or yield curves, from independent third-party sources to determine fair value and classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a non-binding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to use significant judgment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third-party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third-party. When we determine the market for an asset owned by us to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, we use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, we measure fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets; or (ii) a present value technique that considers the future cash flows based on contractual obligations discounted by an observed or estimated market rates of comparable liabilities. The use of contractual cash flows with regard to amount and timing significantly reduces the judgment applied in arriving at fair value.\nRelated Party Transactions and Agreements\nFor a presentation of our quarterly distributions declared and paid to our common stockholders and holders of our common units, refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d\nRevenues include minimum rents, expense recoveries and percentage rental payments. Minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis over the terms of the related leases on a straight-line basis when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased property. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:\nCash flows used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of approximately $4.9 million of our investments in the Wilshire and Sunset and Gardner Joint Ventures. These were partially offset by proceeds of approximately $4.2 million from the sale of our unconsolidated joint venture interests.\n\u2022Seven retail properties, including one property held for sale and excluding a land parcel, comprising an aggregate of approximately 43,000 square feet of single- and multi-tenant, commercial retail space located in two states.\nThe change in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to lower operating income during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, which resulted from sale of Topaz Marketplace during the three months ended March 31, 2020, as well as an increase in accounts receivable balance during the year due to rent deferrals and lower rent collections.\nChanges in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nRecent Financing Transactions\nWe are currently party to the Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which the Advisor manages our business in exchange for specified fees paid for services related to the investment of funds in real estate and real estate-related investments, management of our investments and for other services. Refer to Note 11. Related Party Transactions\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Advisory Agreement and other related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOur board of directors, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of our stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that we will be able to successfully maintain and manage our current portfolio of investments and acquire additional income-producing properties and other real estate-related investments in the future; (2) our executive officers, directors and affiliates of our Advisor have expertise with the type of properties in our current portfolio; and (3) to the extent that we acquire additional real properties or other real estate-related investments in the future, the use of leverage should enable us to acquire assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for our stockholders.\nWe believe that our cash on hand, along with other potential aforementioned sources of liquidity that we may be able to obtain, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, as well as our capital lease and debt obligations for at least the next twelve months and beyond. However, there can be no guarantee that we will be successful with its plan.\n\u2022whether the amount of a tenant improvement allowance is in excess of market rates;\nOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, are not necessarily indicative of those expected in future periods.\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (amounts in thousands):\nOf the total leased square footage in our wholly-owned properties, 47% of the leases were either (i) not modified and the tenants were able to continue to make their payments or (ii) the leases were modified to provide for a short-term temporary rent deferral or abatement. The rent deferrals generally were one to two months and were to be repaid within 12 months. Any rent abatement was typically one to two months and in many cases also involved an extension of the tenant's lease. Another 28% of the leases in our wholly-owned properties were modified to provide ongoing rent relief to the tenant. These leases generally were with restaurants and salons that faced significant operating restrictions limiting their ability to be open, open indoors, or open with anything but a limited capacity. These lease modifications involved some combination of lease extensions, application of security deposits, temporary rent deferrals, partial rent forgiveness or abatement, and new percentage rent clauses to protect the landlord in the event sales returned to prior levels during the period of the lease modifications. These concessions lasted and will last in many cases through the first and second quarters of 2021 to allow these businesses to commit to new operating strategies and costs for a pandemic environment. The tenants making up the remaining 25% of our leased square footage requested lease concessions; however, we could not agree with these tenants on lease changes acceptable to both parties. On December 31, 2020, these tenants were in default under their leases; however, we are temporarily unable to evict them under state and local statutes and moratoria. We are working with these tenants to find replacement tenants and terminate their leases. We are in active lease negotiation for 100% of this space.\n\u2022whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease term.\nIncome Taxes\nFor leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, we recognize income on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis for leases results in reported revenue amounts which differ from those that are contractually due from tenants. If we determine that collectability of straight-line rents is not reasonably assured, we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, establish an allowance for estimated losses.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal results of operations as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower legal and tax compliance fees.\nProperty Disposition and Line of Credit Pay-off\nLeasing Information\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nInterest expense\nCOVID-19 and the efforts to contain its spread have significantly impacted the global economy, the U.S. economy, the economies of the local markets throughout California in which our properties are predominately located, and the broader financial markets. Nearly every industry has been impacted directly or indirectly, and the U.S. retail market has come under severe pressure due to numerous factors, including preventative measures taken by local, state and federal authorities to alleviate the public health crisis such as mandatory business closures, quarantines, restrictions on travel and shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders. There is uncertainty as to the time, date and extent to which these restrictions will be relaxed, lifted or reinstated, businesses of tenants that have closed, either voluntarily or by mandate, will reopen or when customers will re-engage with tenants as they have in the past. Due to this uncertainty, some of our tenants are experiencing hardships, as they are unable to operate at full capacity.\n\u2022 The integrated set of assets and activities is lacking, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs (i.e. revenue generated before and after the transaction).\n\u2022To further preserve cash and liquidity, we suspended our Amended and Restated Share Redemption Program (the SRP\u201d), such suspension was effective on May 21, 2020. The SRP will remain suspended and no further redemptions will be made unless and until our board of directors (the Board\u201d) approves the resumption of the SRP. During the suspension, we will continue to accept death and qualifying disability redemption filings from stockholders, but will not take any action with regard to those requests until the Board has elected to lift the suspension and provided the terms and conditions for any continuation of the program. In addition, on March 27, 2020, the board of directors decided to suspend the payment of any dividend for the quarter ending March 31, 2020, and will reconsider future dividend payments on a quarter by quarter basis as more information becomes available on the impact of COVID-19 and related impact to us. Dividend payments were not reinstated as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and\nOn March 3, 2021, we obtained a $2.5 million Standby Loan Commitment (the Loan\u201d) from Glenborough Property Partners, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor. If we elect to act on the Standby Commitment, the Loan would have a term of 12 months with an interest rate of 7.0% per annum, payable monthly. We would have the right to prepay or repay the Loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty. There are no other loan fees or financing coordination fees paid or payable in connection with this loan. The Loan would be secured by first deed of trust on Shops at Turkey Creek.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report. Also refer to Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nLoss on impairment of real estate and property under development\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020, versus the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSome or all of our distributions have been paid, and in the future may continue to be paid, from sources other than cash flows from operations.\n\u2022We are in constant communication with our tenants and are assisting tenants in identifying local, state and federal resources that may be available to support their businesses and employees during the pandemic, including stimulus funds that may be available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020.\nAs set forth above, in order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. Our board of directors will continue to evaluate the amount of future quarterly distributions based on our operational cash needs.\nData from the U.S. Department of Commerce showed total retail sales in 2020 increased 3.4% from 2019. Total e-commerce sales for 2020 were estimated at $791.7 billion, an increase of 32.4% from 2019. E-commerce sales in 2020 accounted for 14.0% of total sales. E-commerce sales in 2019 accounted for 11.0% of total sales.\nIn asset acquisitions, the purchase consideration, including acquisition costs, is allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. As a result, asset acquisitions do not result in the recognition of goodwill or a bargain purchase gain.\nFair Value Measurements\nShort-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nQuarterly Distributions\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe recorded an impairment loss during the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $13.4 million related to the development project and the operating property we own through joint ventures, which was included in our consolidated statement of operations in this Annual Report. We did not record any impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to Part II, Item 5.

References to shares\u201d and our common stock\u201d refer to the shares of our common stock.\nWe reimburse our Advisor for some expenses paid or incurred by our Advisor in connection with the services provided to us, except that we will not reimburse our Advisor for any amount by which our total operating expenses at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceed the greater of (1) 2% of our average invested assets, as defined in our charter; and (2) 25% of our net income, as defined in our charter, or the 2%/25% Guidelines\u201d unless a majority of our independent directors\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), we are required to measure or disclose certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we are required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:", "item_7_text": "Portfolio Investments\nAs of December 31, 2020, the SRT Loan had a principal balance of approximately $18.0 million. The SRT Loan is a floating LIBOR rate loan which bears interest at 30-day LIBOR (with a floor of 1.50%) plus 2.80%. The default rate is equal to 5% above the rate that otherwise would be in effect. Monthly payments are interest-only with the entire principal balance and all outstanding interest due at maturity.\nImpact of COVID-19\nLoss on impairment of approximately $13.4 million related to an operating property and a development project we own through joint ventures.\nLine of Credit\n\u25e6a retail property comprising approximately 12,000 square fee of multi-tenant, commercial retail space in the Los Angeles, California area.\n\u2022 The process includes an organized workforce (or includes an acquired contract that provides access to an organized workforce), that is skilled, knowledgeable, and experienced in performing the process;\nDepreciation and amortization expenses stayed flat during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to classification of Topaz Marketplace as held for sale during the three months ended September, 2019, and subsequent sale in February 2020, as well as the classification of Shops at Turkey Creek as held for sale during the three months ended December 31, 2020. This was partially offset by the placement of the Wilshire Property in service in August 2020.\nBeginning with January 1, 2017, acquisitions were determined to be asset acquisitions, as they did not meet the definition of a business.\nLoans Secured by Properties Under Development\nPublicly traded real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d) in the shopping center and mall sectors showed negative returns for 2020 with shopping REITs posting total return losses of 24.2% and malls posting total return losses of 28.9%, while the overall REIT market saw total return losses of 14.9% according to KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of a real estate company's operating performance. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT\u201d, an industry trade group, has promulgated this supplemental performance measure and defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures (adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.) It is important to note that not only is FFO not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, it also does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or our ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of distributions.\n\u25e6a property under development in the Los Angeles, California area that is expected to comprise approximately 100,000 square feet upon completion.\ntaxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state or local income taxes and to U.S. Federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nGuidelines on Total Operating Expenses\n2020 Significant Events\nQuarterly Distributions\nSince our inception, our principal demand for funds has been for the acquisition of real estate, the payment of operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, the payment of distributions to our stockholders and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and development properties. On February 7, 2013, we ceased offering shares of our common stock in our primary offering and under our distribution reinvestment plan. As a result of the termination of our initial public offering, offering proceeds from the sale of our securities are not currently available to fund our cash needs. We have used and expect to continue to use debt financing, net sales proceeds and cash flow from operations to fund our cash needs.\n\nReview of our Policies\nSubsequent Events\nMulti-Property Secured Financing\nas a result of the prepayment and subject to certain other conditions contained in the loan documents. Individual properties may be released from the SRT Loan collateral in connection with bona fide third-party sales, subject to compliance with certain covenants and conditions contained in the SRT Loan Agreement. Any prepayment or repayment on or before the first 12 months of the loan term in connection with a bona fide third-party sale of a property securing the SRT Loan shall only require the payment of yield maintenance payments calculated through the 12th monthly payment date.\nThe following table provides summary information about our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of carve-out guarantees in connection with one of our previous investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as described in the consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These carve-out guarantees do not represent a liability of the partners other than carve-out guarantees for certain matters such as environmental conditions, misuse of funds and material misrepresentations. We have retained certain rights of recovery in connection with these carve-out guarantees. As of February 2021, all of the related loans were repaid in full.\nOn May 7, 2019, we refinanced and repaid our financing with Loan Oak Fund, LLC with a new construction loan from ReadyCap Commercial, LLC (the Lender\u201d) (the Wilshire Construction Loan\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the Wilshire Construction Loan had a principal balance of approximately $12.5 million, with future funding availability up to a total of approximately $13.9 million, and bears an interest rate of 1-month LIBOR plus an interest margin of 4.25% per annum, payable monthly. The Wilshire Construction Loan is scheduled to mature on May 10, 2022, with options to extend for two additional twelve-month periods, subject to certain conditions as stated in the loan agreement. The Wilshire Construction Loan is secured by a first Deed of Trust on the Wilshire Property. We executed a guaranty that guaranties that the loan interest reserve amounts are kept in compliance with the terms of the loan agreement. The Lender also required that a principal in the upstream owner of our joint venture partner in the Wilshire Joint Venture (the Guarantor\u201d), guarantees performance of borrower's obligations under the loan agreement with respect to the completion of capital improvements to the property. We executed an Indemnity Agreement in favor of the Guarantor against liability under that completion guaranty except to the extent caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, as well as for liabilities incurred under the Environmental Indemnity Agreement executed by the Guarantor in favor of the Lender. We used working capital funds of approximately $3.1 million to repay the difference between the Wilshire Construction Loan initial advance and the prior loan, to pay transaction costs, as well as to fund certain required interest and construction reserves.\nWe evaluate our acquisitions in accordance with ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d) that clarifies the framework for determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities meets the definition of a business. The revised framework establishes a screen for determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities is a business and narrows the definition of a business, which is expected to result in fewer transactions being accounted for as business combinations. Acquisitions of integrated sets of assets and activities that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions.\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of non-orderly transactions (1) there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions; (2) there was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant; (3) the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (that is, distressed), or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (that is, forced); and (4) the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities.\n\u2022 The process is considered unique or scarce.\n\u2022Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on the economy and the related future uncertainty, on March 27, 2020, our board of directors decided to suspend the payment of any dividend for the quarters ending March 31, 2020, and to reconsider future dividend payments on a quarter by quarter basis as more information becomes available on the impact of COVID-19 and related impact to the Company. Dividend payments were not reinstated as of December 31, 2020\nOn March 3, 2021, we obtained a $2.5 million Standby Loan Commitment (the Loan\u201d) from Glenborough Property Partners, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor. If we elect to act on the Standby Commitment, the Loan would have a term of 12 months with an interest rate of 7.0% per annum, payable monthly. We would have the right to prepay or repay the Loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty. There are no other loan fees or financing coordination fees paid or payable in connection with this loan. The Loan would be secured by first deed of trust on Shops at Turkey Creek.\n\u2022Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available for inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement.\nOther Events\nCash flows provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of approximately $9.9 million of proceeds from sale of Topaz Marketplace, which were partially offset by our aggregate additional $6.9 million investment in the Wilshire and Sunset and Gardner Joint Ventures.\nInvestment sales volumes of retail properties for 2020 fell by 43% as compared to 2019, according to CBRE, and down 52% from the five-year average. CBRE reported strong first quarter 2020 sales then a significant drop in the second quarter as tenant closures and reduced leasing activity led to operating income uncertainty and a restricted lending environment.\n\u2022 The process cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay; or\nInflation\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 requires entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous guidance. However, the principal difference from previous guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases should be recognized in the statement of financial position. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under ASC Topic 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d). Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using the modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply under ASC Topic 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d). The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2016-02 (as amended by subsequent ASUs) effective January 1, 2019, utilizing the practical expedients described in ASU 2018-11. We elected the lessor practical expedient to not separate common area maintenance and reimbursement of real estate taxes from the associated lease for all existing and new leases as the timing and pattern of payments and associated lease payments are the same. The timing of revenue recognition remains the same for our existing leases and new leases. Revenues related to our leases continue to be reported on one line in the presentation within the statement of operations as a result of electing this lessor practical expedient. We continue to capitalize our direct leasing costs. These costs are incurred as a result of obtaining new leases, and renewing leases, and are paid to our Advisor. Additionally, we are not a lessee of real estate or equipment, as we are externally managed by our Advisor.\nOn March 27, 2020, our board of directors voted to suspend the payment of any dividend for the quarter ending March 31, 2020, and to reconsider future dividend payments on a quarter by quarter basis. Dividend payments were not reinstated as of December 31, 2020.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nOther income, net\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nCash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of approximately $39.5 million from loan proceeds and draws on our line of credit. This was partially offset by repayment of our debt balances of approximately $30.2 million, our quarterly dividend payments of approximately $2.7 million, and redemptions of our common stock of approximately $0.7 million.\nWhen necessary, deferred income taxes are recognized in certain taxable entities. Deferred income tax is generally a function of the period's temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes). A valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets is provided if all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance is generally included in deferred income tax expense.\nWhen certain criteria are met, long-lived assets are classified as held for sale and are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. With the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant, and Equipment on April 30, 2014, only disposed properties that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results are reported as discontinued operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe evaluate tax positions taken in the consolidated financial statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not\u201d that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.\nWe consider FFO to be a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance and one that is an appropriate supplemental disclosure for an equity REIT due to its widespread acceptance and use within the REIT and analyst communities. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.\n\u2022whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSince our inception, our business has been managed by an external advisor. We do not have direct employees and all management and administrative personnel responsible for conducting our business are employed by our advisor. Currently we are externally managed and advised by SRT Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Advisor\u201d) pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (the Advisory Agreement\u201d) initially executed on August 10, 2013, and subsequently renewed every year through 2021. The current term of the Advisory Agreement terminates on August 9, 2021. The Advisor is an affiliate of Glenborough, LLC (together with its affiliates, Glenborough\u201d), a privately held full-service real estate investment and management company focused on the acquisition, management and leasing of commercial properties.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe SRT Loan is secured by first deeds of trust on our five San Francisco assets (Fulton Shops, 8 Octavia, 400 Grove, 450 Hayes and 388 Fulton Street) as well as our Silverlake Collection located in Los Angeles. Proceeds from the SRT Loan were used by us to pay down our credit facility and in connection with such payment, the properties referenced above were released from liens related to that credit facility. The SRT Loan matures on January 9, 2023. We have an option to extend the term of the loan for two additional twelve-month periods, subject to the satisfaction of certain covenants and conditions contained in the SRT Loan Agreement. We have the right to prepay the SRT Loan in whole at any time or in part from time to time, subject to the payment of yield maintenance payments if such prepayment occurs in the first 18 months of the loan term, calculated through the 18th monthly payment date, as well as certain expenses, costs or liabilities potentially incurred by the SRT Lender\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio included:\nOur ability to access capital on favorable terms as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our liquidity needs could be affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our rental revenue and, as a result, future cash from operations cannot be determined at present.\nOn March 3, 2021, SRT Advisor, LLC, the Advisor of Strategic Realty Trust and an affiliate of Glenborough, LLC, has notified the Board of Directors of Strategic Realty Trust, Inc. of its consolidation with PUR SRT Advisors LLC, an affiliate of PUR Management LLC, which is an affiliate of L3 Capital, LLC. L3 Capital is a real estate investment firm focused on institutional quality, value-add, prime urban retail and mixed-use investment within first tier U.S. metropolitan markets.\nOperating and maintenance expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to higher bad debt reserves. Additionally, placement of the Wilshire Property in service in August 2020, contributed to the increase in operating and maintenance expenses.\nInvestments in Real Estate\n\nCash flows used by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisted of approximately $8.9 million in repayments of our line of credit. This was partially offset by approximately $4.0 million from construction loan proceeds.\nLoans Secured by Properties\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which our REIT qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nIn order to preserve cash in light of the uncertainty relating to the economic impact of COVID-19, our board of directors approved the suspension of the SRP, which offered redemption opportunities only in connection with a stockholder's death or qualifying disability.\nIn connection with the SRT Loan, we executed customary non-recourse carveout and environmental guaranties, together with limited additional assurances with regard to the condominium structures of the San Francisco assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.8 million and we had $0.8 million of restricted cash (funds held by the lenders for property taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capital expenditures, rollover reserves and other financing needs).\nThe retail market ended the year with a vacancy rate of 6.6% up from 6.1% according to CBRE reports, with the fourth quarter net absorption of 7.1 million square feet, the strongest since the start of the pandemic.\nExcluding the property held for sale, there were no new leases added in our retail properties during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The following table provides information regarding our leasing activity, excluding leasing activity in held for sale property, for the year ended December 31, 2020 for properties we held as of December 31, 2020.\nWe evaluate each acquisition of real estate to determine if the integrated set of assets and activities acquired meet the definition of a business and need to be accounted for as a business combination. If either of the following criteria is met, the integrated set of assets and activities acquired would not qualify as a business:\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers. As our revenues are primarily generated through leasing arrangements, our revenues fall out of the scope of this standard. Effective January 1, 2018, we applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 610-20, Gains and Losses From the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets ( ASC 610-20\u201d), for gains on sale of real estate, and recognize any gains at the time control of a property is transferred and when it is probable that substantially all of the related consideration will be collected.\nRevenue\nOur calculation of FFO attributable to common shares and Common Units and the reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO is as follows (amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts):\nLong-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that the COVID-19 outbreak has and could continue to negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to, declines in real estate rental revenues, the inability to sell certain properties at a favorable price, and a decrease in construction and leasing activity. The majority of our tenants have requested rent deferral or rent abatement as a result of the pandemic. At the start of the pandemic and shelter-in-place orders, a majority of our tenants requested rent deferral or rent abatement due to the pandemic and government-mandated restrictions. These tenants initially totaled 94% of the leased square footage in our wholly-owned properties. We reviewed these requests on a case-by-case basis and agreed to modifications to some of the tenant leases, and other leases were not modified. In most cases, it is in our best interest to help our tenants remain in business and reopen when shelter-in-place orders or other mandated closures or restrictions are lifted. If these tenants fail, finding replacement tenants may be costly and time-consuming.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nCertain leases contain provisions that require the payment of additional rents based on the respective tenants' sales volume (contingent or percentage rent) and substantially all contain provisions that require reimbursement of the tenants' allocable real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance costs ( CAM\u201d). Revenue based on percentage of tenants' sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds its sales breakpoint. Revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes, CAM and insurance is recognized in the period that the applicable costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreement.\nOn July 31, 2020, we extended the Sunset & Gardner Loan for an additional twelve-month period under the same terms, with an interest rate of 7.3% per annum. The new maturity date is October 31, 2021.\nOn December 24, 2019, we entered into a Loan Agreement (the SRT Loan Agreement\u201d) with PFP Holding Company, LLC (the SRT Lender\u201d) for a non-recourse secured loan (the SRT Loan\u201d).\nPursuant to the SRT Loan, we must comply with certain matters contained in the loan documents including but not limited to, (i) requirements to deliver audited and unaudited financial statements, SEC filings, tax returns, pro forma budgets, and quarterly compliance certificates, and (ii) minimum limits on our liquidity and tangible net worth. The SRT Loan contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, covenants with respect to maintenance of properties and insurance, compliance with laws and environmental matters, covenants limiting or prohibiting the creation of liens, and transactions with affiliates.\nOn a long-term basis, our principal demand for funds will be for real estate and real estate-related investments and the payment of acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions to stockholders, future redemptions of shares and interest and principal payments on current and future indebtedness. Generally, we intend to meet cash needs for items other than acquisitions and acquisition-related expenses from our cash flow from operations, debt and sales of properties. On a long-term basis, we expect that substantially all cash generated from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after satisfying our operating expenses including interest and principal payments. We may consider future public offerings or private placements of equity. Refer to Note 7. Notes Payable, Net\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the maturity dates and terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\nGenerally, we expect that acquisitions of real estate will not meet the revised definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e. land, buildings, and related intangible assets), or because the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay.\nInterest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, due to the placement of the Wilshire Property in service. Capitalization of interest expense related to the Wilshire Property construction loan ceased in August 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of deferred loan fees.\nLoans Secured by Properties Under Development\ndetermines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total operating expenses did not exceed the 2%/25% Guidelines.\nAssets Held for Sale\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our investments in real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets through its undiscounted future cash flows (excluding interest) and its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the investments in real estate and related intangible assets. Key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates, capital expenditures, property sales capitalization rates and expected holding period of the property.\nDepreciation and amortization is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\u2022We fully paid off the revolving line of credit with the SRT Loan (as defined below) from PFP Holding Company, LLC (the SRT Lender\u201d). The SRT Loan is secured by six of our core urban properties in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The SRT Loan does not have the sort of restrictive covenants and ongoing debt coverage ratios that could trigger a default caused by tenants not paying rent or seeking rent relief (unlike the former line of credit).\nIncome taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, primarily consisted of various state tax payments.\nThe Shops at Turkey Creek remains unencumbered by debt and is available for financing to provide us funds, if needed. Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, Shops at Turkey Creek was listed for sale.\nWe evaluate our equity investments for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Securities ( ASC 320\u201d). ASC 320 provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired, whether impairment is other-than-temporary, and measurement of an impairment loss.\nOn February 10, 2020, we used proceeds from the sale of Topaz Marketplace to repay the line of credit in its entirety. The line of credit expired of its own accord on February 15, 2020, with no balance outstanding. As part of the payoff, Shops at Turkey Creek was released from the line of credit.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn October 29, 2018, we entered into a loan agreement with Lone Oak Fund, LLC (the Sunset & Gardner Loan\u201d). The Sunset & Gardner Loan has a principal balance of approximately $8.7 million, and had an interest rate of 6.9% per annum. The original Sunset & Gardner Loan agreement matured on October 31, 2019. We extended the Sunset & Gardner Loan for an additional twelve-month period under the same terms, with an interest rate of 6.5% per annum. On July 31, 2020, we extended the Sunset & Gardner Loan for an additional twelve-month period under the same terms, with an interest rate of 7.3% per annum. The new maturity date is October 31, 2021. The Sunset & Gardner Loan is secured by a first Deed of Trust on the Sunset & Gardner Property.\nOn February 10, 2020, we consummated the disposition of Topaz Marketplace, located in Hesperia, California for approximately $10.5 million in cash, a portion of which was used to repay our line of credit in its entirety. The line of credit expired of its own accord on February 15, 2020, with no balance outstanding. As part of the payoff, Shops at Turkey Creek was released from the line of credit.\nThe majority of our leases at our properties contain inflation protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for common area maintenance charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per square foot allowance. We expect to include similar provisions in our future tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases, as well as rents received from acquired leases, may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market rates.\nTenant improvement costs recorded as capital assets are depreciated over the tenant's remaining lease term, which we determined approximates the useful life of the improvement. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized. Acquisition costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\u2022 Substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in either a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; or\nwas assigned a moderate\u201d tier in September 2020, which allows for some indoor business operations to open with modifications. Los Angeles County remains in the widespread\u201d tier, requiring many non-essential indoors business operations to stay closed. On December 6, 2020, due to a significant rise in COVID-19 cases around the Thanksgiving holiday and beyond, as part of California's mitigation measures, both Los Angeles and San Francisco counties went into a regional stay-at-home order. This order implemented restrictions requiring many non-essential indoor business operations to close or stay closed. This order was subsequently lifted effective January 28, 2021, with both counties remaining in the widespread\u201d tier.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 79% and 90% of our portfolio was leased (based on rentable square footage), respectively, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately 6.3 years and 6.8 years, respectively. In 2020, there was one property disposition. There were no property dispositions in 2019.\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to the sale of Topaz Marketplace in February 2020, which accounted for approximately $0.9 million of the total decrease in revenue. Additionally, rent concessions provided to our tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the decrease in revenue compared to the same period in 2019.\nMarket Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets\nREIT Compliance\nResults of Operations\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused state and local governments to institute quarantines, shelter-in-place rules and restrictions on travel, the types of business that may continue to operate, and the types of construction projects that may continue. California, where the majority of our properties are located, declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 and instituted a shelter-in-place order on March 19, 2020 to reduce the spread of COVID-19. On May 7, 2020, California moved into Stage 2 of its four-stage reopening roadmap, permitting certain sectors of the economy to reopen provided that there were significant safety measures in place. On June 12, 2020, California permitted businesses such as movie theaters, restaurants, wineries, bars, zoos, museums, gyms, fitness centers, hotels, card rooms, racetracks, and campgrounds to re-open. On July 13, 2020, California re-instituted a state-wide closure on many types of businesses that were previously permitted to re-open such as indoor dining, bars, movie theaters, and museums. In August 2020, California moved to a four-tier, color-coded system assigning every county to a tier based on its test positivity and adjusted case rate. San Francisco County, where a number of our properties are located,\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nShare Redemption under the Share Redemption Program\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\n\u2022whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;\nOur principal short-term demand for funds is for the payment of operating expenses and the payment on our outstanding indebtedness. To date, our cash needs for operations have been funded by cash provided by property operations, the sales of properties and the sale of shares of our common stock. We may fund our short-term operating cash needs from operations, from the sales of properties and from debt.\nReal estate lending markets remain difficult with retail, office and hotels being the least favored property classes and industrial and multifamily attracting more lender attention. Volumes increased in the fourth quarter from very low levels during the pandemic, however loan-to-value percentages are trending down to lower advance ratios.\n\nEffective January 8, 2020, we elected to permanently reduce the maximum aggregate commitment under its line of credit from $30.0 million to $10.5 million. All other terms of the credit facility remained the same.\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease.\nOur tax returns remain subject to examination and consequently, the taxability of our distributions is subject to change.\n\u2022Investments in two consolidated joint ventures, which own:\nOur aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended, which we refer to as our charter,\u201d we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets. Net assets for purposes of this calculation is defined to be our total assets (other than intangibles), valued at cost prior to deducting depreciation, reserves for bad debts and other non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. However, we may temporarily borrow in excess of these amounts if such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with an explanation for such excess. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our borrowings were approximately 90.1% and 75.1%, respectively, of the carrying value of our net assets.\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2020, consisted of a gain on sale of Topaz Marketplace of approximately $0.9 million. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of approximately $1.4 million related to the gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests.\n\u2022We remain in compliance with all the terms of the Wilshire Construction Loan (as defined below), which matures on May 10, 2022 with the options to extend for two additional twelve-month periods, subject to certain conditions. Similarly, we remain in compliance with the Sunset & Gardner Loan (as defined below), which matures on October 31, 2021.\n\u2022We believe we will be able to service our debts and pay for our ongoing general and administrative expenses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $1.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had approximately $0.8 million of restricted cash (funds held by the lenders for property taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capital expenditures, rollover reserves and other financing needs). Furthermore, the Shops at Turkey Creek remains unencumbered by debt and is available for financing to provide us funds, if needed. Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, Shops at Turkey Creek was listed for sale.\nMortgage Financing\nWe are a Maryland corporation that was formed on September 18, 2008, to invest in and manage a portfolio of income-producing retail properties, located in the United States, real estate-owning entities and real estate-related assets, including the investment in or origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans related to commercial real estate. During the first quarter of 2016, we also invested, through joint ventures, in two significant retail projects under development, one of which was substantially completed during the year ended December 31, 2020. We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009, and we have operated and intend to continue to operate in such a manner. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations through our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We also own a majority of the outstanding limited partner interests in the operating partnership.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market (1) there are few recent transactions; (2) price quotations are not based on current information; (3) price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example, some brokered markets); (4) indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability; (5) there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with our estimate of expected cash flows, considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability; (6) there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread; (7) there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances (that is, a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities; and (8) little information is released publicly (for example, a principal-to-principal market).\nEvaluation of business combination or asset acquisition:\nAn acquired process is considered substantive if:\n\nTo mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and liquidity, we have taken a number of proactive measures, which include the following:\nFunds From Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to major changes in the make-up of the total retail sales figures. Retailers such as grocery stores, home improvement and sporting goods saw strong increases, while traditional department stores, apparel, travel, gas stations and restaurants saw significant declines.\n\u2022whether the lease stipulates how a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;\n(1)Our common units have the right to convert a unit into common stock for a one-to-one conversion. Therefore, we are including the related non-controlling interest income/loss attributable to common units in the computation of FFO and including the common units together with weighted average shares outstanding for the computation of FFO per share and common unit.\nGiven the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic's near and potential long-term impact on our business, the full extent of the financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. However, there are those who believe that, as more tools are developed to fight COVID-19 - increased testing, enhanced monitoring, data analysis and identification of effective therapeutics-the country can, anchored by advice of healthcare specialists, incrementally foster economic activity in the near term and at some point with a vaccine and time, the country should return to a more normal state as with other pandemics in the past. Although vaccines for COVID-19 are being made available to the general public in the U.S. and around the world, it will take time for the vaccine to materially affect the spread of the virus and the outbreak could have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions.\n\u2022Our Advisor has been able to transition all employees and operations to a remote work environment, beginning on March 16, 2020, and we have been fortunate that our operations have continued successfully during these difficult times.\nOn August 2, 2018, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Advisory Agreement. The Advisory Agreement Amendment provides that the Advisor shall not be required to reimburse to us any operating expenses incurred during a given period that exceed the applicable limit on Total Operating Expenses\u201d (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) to the extent that such excess operating expenses are incurred as a result of certain unusual and non-recurring factors approved by our board of directors, including some related to the execution of our investment strategy as directed by our board of directors. These provisions were also included in the Eighth Amendment to the Advisory Agreement entered into July 30, 2020.\nOverview\nWhen available, we utilize quoted market prices or other observable inputs (Level 2 inputs), such as interest rates or yield curves, from independent third-party sources to determine fair value and classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a non-binding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to use significant judgment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third-party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third-party. When we determine the market for an asset owned by us to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, we use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, we measure fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets; or (ii) a present value technique that considers the future cash flows based on contractual obligations discounted by an observed or estimated market rates of comparable liabilities. The use of contractual cash flows with regard to amount and timing significantly reduces the judgment applied in arriving at fair value.\nRelated Party Transactions and Agreements\nFor a presentation of our quarterly distributions declared and paid to our common stockholders and holders of our common units, refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d\nRevenues include minimum rents, expense recoveries and percentage rental payments. Minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis over the terms of the related leases on a straight-line basis when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased property. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:\nCash flows used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of approximately $4.9 million of our investments in the Wilshire and Sunset and Gardner Joint Ventures. These were partially offset by proceeds of approximately $4.2 million from the sale of our unconsolidated joint venture interests.\n\u2022Seven retail properties, including one property held for sale and excluding a land parcel, comprising an aggregate of approximately 43,000 square feet of single- and multi-tenant, commercial retail space located in two states.\nThe change in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to lower operating income during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, which resulted from sale of Topaz Marketplace during the three months ended March 31, 2020, as well as an increase in accounts receivable balance during the year due to rent deferrals and lower rent collections.\nChanges in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nRecent Financing Transactions\nWe are currently party to the Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which the Advisor manages our business in exchange for specified fees paid for services related to the investment of funds in real estate and real estate-related investments, management of our investments and for other services. Refer to Note 11. Related Party Transactions\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Advisory Agreement and other related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOur board of directors, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of our stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that we will be able to successfully maintain and manage our current portfolio of investments and acquire additional income-producing properties and other real estate-related investments in the future; (2) our executive officers, directors and affiliates of our Advisor have expertise with the type of properties in our current portfolio; and (3) to the extent that we acquire additional real properties or other real estate-related investments in the future, the use of leverage should enable us to acquire assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for our stockholders.\nWe believe that our cash on hand, along with other potential aforementioned sources of liquidity that we may be able to obtain, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, as well as our capital lease and debt obligations for at least the next twelve months and beyond. However, there can be no guarantee that we will be successful with its plan.\n\u2022whether the amount of a tenant improvement allowance is in excess of market rates;\nOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, are not necessarily indicative of those expected in future periods.\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (amounts in thousands):\nOf the total leased square footage in our wholly-owned properties, 47% of the leases were either (i) not modified and the tenants were able to continue to make their payments or (ii) the leases were modified to provide for a short-term temporary rent deferral or abatement. The rent deferrals generally were one to two months and were to be repaid within 12 months. Any rent abatement was typically one to two months and in many cases also involved an extension of the tenant's lease. Another 28% of the leases in our wholly-owned properties were modified to provide ongoing rent relief to the tenant. These leases generally were with restaurants and salons that faced significant operating restrictions limiting their ability to be open, open indoors, or open with anything but a limited capacity. These lease modifications involved some combination of lease extensions, application of security deposits, temporary rent deferrals, partial rent forgiveness or abatement, and new percentage rent clauses to protect the landlord in the event sales returned to prior levels during the period of the lease modifications. These concessions lasted and will last in many cases through the first and second quarters of 2021 to allow these businesses to commit to new operating strategies and costs for a pandemic environment. The tenants making up the remaining 25% of our leased square footage requested lease concessions; however, we could not agree with these tenants on lease changes acceptable to both parties. On December 31, 2020, these tenants were in default under their leases; however, we are temporarily unable to evict them under state and local statutes and moratoria. We are working with these tenants to find replacement tenants and terminate their leases. We are in active lease negotiation for 100% of this space.\n\u2022whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease term.\nIncome Taxes\nFor leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, we recognize income on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis for leases results in reported revenue amounts which differ from those that are contractually due from tenants. If we determine that collectability of straight-line rents is not reasonably assured, we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, establish an allowance for estimated losses.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal results of operations as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower legal and tax compliance fees.\nProperty Disposition and Line of Credit Pay-off\nLeasing Information\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nInterest expense\nCOVID-19 and the efforts to contain its spread have significantly impacted the global economy, the U.S. economy, the economies of the local markets throughout California in which our properties are predominately located, and the broader financial markets. Nearly every industry has been impacted directly or indirectly, and the U.S. retail market has come under severe pressure due to numerous factors, including preventative measures taken by local, state and federal authorities to alleviate the public health crisis such as mandatory business closures, quarantines, restrictions on travel and shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders. There is uncertainty as to the time, date and extent to which these restrictions will be relaxed, lifted or reinstated, businesses of tenants that have closed, either voluntarily or by mandate, will reopen or when customers will re-engage with tenants as they have in the past. Due to this uncertainty, some of our tenants are experiencing hardships, as they are unable to operate at full capacity.\n\u2022 The integrated set of assets and activities is lacking, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs (i.e. revenue generated before and after the transaction).\n\u2022To further preserve cash and liquidity, we suspended our Amended and Restated Share Redemption Program (the SRP\u201d), such suspension was effective on May 21, 2020. The SRP will remain suspended and no further redemptions will be made unless and until our board of directors (the Board\u201d) approves the resumption of the SRP. During the suspension, we will continue to accept death and qualifying disability redemption filings from stockholders, but will not take any action with regard to those requests until the Board has elected to lift the suspension and provided the terms and conditions for any continuation of the program. In addition, on March 27, 2020, the board of directors decided to suspend the payment of any dividend for the quarter ending March 31, 2020, and will reconsider future dividend payments on a quarter by quarter basis as more information becomes available on the impact of COVID-19 and related impact to us. Dividend payments were not reinstated as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and\nOn March 3, 2021, we obtained a $2.5 million Standby Loan Commitment (the Loan\u201d) from Glenborough Property Partners, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor. If we elect to act on the Standby Commitment, the Loan would have a term of 12 months with an interest rate of 7.0% per annum, payable monthly. We would have the right to prepay or repay the Loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty. There are no other loan fees or financing coordination fees paid or payable in connection with this loan. The Loan would be secured by first deed of trust on Shops at Turkey Creek.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report.

In addition, we are required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:", "item_7_tables": "Table 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,508) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(947) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment to reflect FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of in-place leases and leasing costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>290 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on impairment of real estate and property under development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common shares and Common Units (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,691) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,786 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO per share and Common Unit (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.15) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares and units outstanding (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,962,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,049,317 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,295) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,099) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>2,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,435) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,540 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>(5,429) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,954) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,619) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Vacant\nRentable\nSq.
