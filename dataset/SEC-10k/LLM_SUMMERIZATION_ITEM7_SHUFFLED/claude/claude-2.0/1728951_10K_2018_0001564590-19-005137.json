Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and Business\u201d sections, as well as the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are an internally managed real estate company that acquires, owns and manages primarily single-tenant properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to middle-market companies operating service-oriented or experience-based businesses. We have a diversified portfolio that focuses on properties leased to tenants in businesses such as restaurants (including quick service and casual and family dining), car washes, automotive services, medical services, convenience stores, entertainment, early childhood education and health and fitness. We acquire and lease freestanding, single-tenant commercial real estate facilities where a tenant services its customers and conducts activities that are essential to the generation of the tenant's sales and profits.\nWe were organized on January 12, 2018 as a Maryland corporation and intend to qualify to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. On June 25, 2018, we completed our IPO of 32,500,000 shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-225215), filed with the SEC under the Securities Act. On July 24, 2018, we issued an additional 2,772,191 shares of common stock at the IPO price of $14.00 per share pursuant to the partial exercise of an option granted to the underwriters of our IPO. Net proceeds from the IPO and the issuance of shares to underwriters, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses, were $458.7 million. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol EPRT\u201d.\nPrior to the completion of the IPO, we engaged in a number of formation transactions designed to facilitate the completion of the IPO (the Formation Transactions\u201d). Among other things, on June 20, 2018, EPRT LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware limited partnership, changed its name to Essential Properties, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d) and became the subsidiary through which we hold substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations. Prior to the completion of the Formation Transactions, EPRT LLC was a wholly owned subsidiary of EPRT Holdings (together with EPRT LLC, the Predecessor\u201d), and EPRT Holdings received 17,913,592 units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( OP Units\u201d) in connection with EPRT LLC's conversion into a Delaware limited partnership. Essential Properties OP G.P., LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, became the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership in connection with the completion of our IPO.\nConcurrent with the completion of the IPO, we received an additional $125.0 million investment from an affiliate of Eldridge in the Concurrent Private Placement of 7,785,611 shares of our common stock and 1,142,960 OP Units. We contributed the net proceeds from the issuance of the 43,057,802 shares of common stock in our IPO (inclusive of the shares issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares) and the Concurrent Private Placement of common stock to Eldridge to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a like number of OP Units.\nWe generally lease each of our properties to a single tenant on a triple-net, long-term basis, and we generate our cash from operations primarily through the monthly lease payments, or base rent, we receive from the tenants that occupy our properties. As of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of real estate investments at 677 properties (inclusive of one undeveloped land parcel and 12 properties which\nsecure our investments in mortgage loans receivable) that was diversified by tenant, industry and geography, had annualized base rent of $106.8 million and was 100.0% occupied.\nSubstantially all of our leases provide for periodic contractual rent escalations. As of December 31, 2018, leases contributing 97.1% of our annualized base rent provided for increases in future annual base rent, generally ranging from 1% to 4% annually, with a weighted average annual escalation equal to 1.5% of base rent. As of December 31, 2018, leases contributing 91.9% of annualized base rent were triple-net, which means that our tenant is responsible for all operating expenses, such as maintenance, insurance, utility and tax expense, related to the leased property (including any increases in those costs that may occur as a result of inflation). Our remaining leases were double net,\u201d where the tenant is responsible for certain expenses, such as taxes and insurance, but we retain responsibility for other expenses, generally related to maintenance and structural component replacement that may be required on such leased properties in the future. Also, we incur property-level expenses associated with our vacant properties and we occasionally incur nominal property-level expenses that are not paid by our tenants, such as the costs of periodically making site inspections of our properties. Since our properties are predominantly single-tenant properties, which are generally subject to long-term leases, it is not necessary for us to perform any significant ongoing leasing activities on our properties. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted average remaining term of our leases was 14.2 years (based on annualized base rent), excluding renewal options that have not been exercised, with 3.1% of our annualized base rent attributable to leases expiring prior to January 1, 2023. Renewal options are exercisable at the option of our tenants upon expiration of their base lease term. Our leases providing for tenant renewal options generally provide for periodic contractual rent escalations during any renewed term that are similar to those applicable during the initial term of the lease.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 67.4% of our annualized base rent was attributable to master leases, where we have acquired multiple properties from a seller and leased them back to the seller under a master lease. Since properties are generally leased under a master lease on an all or none\u201d basis, the structure prevents a tenant from cherry picking\u201d locations, where it unilaterally gives up underperforming properties while maintaining its leasehold interest in well-performing properties.\nConsistent with our intent to elect to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018, we believe that we were organized and operated in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe seek to acquire real estate with a combination of debt and equity capital and with cash from operations that will not otherwise be distributed to our stockholders. Prior to the IPO, equity capital needed for our real estate investments had been provided to us by Eldridge, our primary institutional capital provider. Subsequent to the IPO, we added public equity capital to our initial private institutional equity capital to facilitate our growth. Additionally, we used the net proceeds from the IPO and the Concurrent Private Placement to repay promissory notes issued to an affiliate of Eldridge, which had been our primary source of short-term debt capital prior to the IPO. Historically, upon accumulating a sufficiently large and diverse pool of real estate, we generally refinanced this debt through the issuance of long-term, fixed-rate debt through our Master Trust Funding Program, as further described below.\nIn June 2018, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility, which is available to fund our short-term debt capital requirements, as further described below. Over time, we may access additional long-term debt capital with future debt issuances through our Master Trust Funding Program. Additionally, future sources of debt capital may include term borrowings from insurance companies, banks and other sources, single-asset mortgage financing and CMBS borrowings, and may offer us the opportunity to lower our cost of funding and further diversify our sources of debt capital. Over time, we may choose to issue preferred equity as a part of our overall funding strategy. As our outstanding debt matures, we may refinance it as it comes due or choose to repay it using cash and cash equivalents or borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Management believes that the cash generated by our operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018, the Revolving Credit Facility, and our access\nto long-term debt capital, will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and allow us to acquire the real estate for which we currently have made commitments.\nBy seeking to match the expected cash inflows from our long-term leases with the expected cash outflows for our long-term, fixed-rate debt, we seek to lock in,\u201d for as long as is economically feasible, the expected positive difference between our scheduled cash inflows on the leases and the cash outflows on our debt obligations. In this way, we seek to reduce the risk that increases in interest rates would adversely impact our results of operations. Although we are not required to maintain a particular leverage ratio and may not be able to do so, we generally intend to target, over time, a level of net debt (which includes recourse and non-recourse borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock less unrestricted cash and cash held for the benefit of lenders) that is less than six times our annualized adjusted EBITDAre.\nAs we grow our real estate portfolio, we intend to manage our long-term debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of our debt will mature in any single year in the future. As of December 31, 2018, our nearest significant debt maturity was $272.3 million of notes issued under the Master Trust Funding Program, which mature in November 2046 but require monthly principal and interest payments through October 2021, with a balloon principal payment of $259.5 million due in November 2021. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we had, as of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings of $34.0 million and $266.0 million of unused borrowing capacity.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1.3 billion of net investments in our investment portfolio, consisting of investments in 677 properties (inclusive of one undeveloped land parcel and 12 properties which secure our investments in mortgage loans receivable), with annualized base rent of $106.8 million. Substantially all of our cash from operations is generated by our investment portfolio.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our operating expenses, including principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, and the general and administrative expenses of servicing our portfolio and operating our business. Since our occupancy level is high and substantially all of our leases are triple-net, our tenants are generally responsible for the maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us. When a property becomes vacant through a tenant default or expiration of the lease term with no tenant renewal, we incur the property costs not paid by the tenant, as well as those property costs accruing during the time it takes to locate a substitute tenant. As of December 31, 2018, excluding one undeveloped land parcel, all of our property locations were occupied and subject to a lease. We expect to incur some property costs from time to time in periods during which properties that become vacant are being marketed for lease. In addition, we may recognize an expense for certain property costs, such as real estate taxes billed in arrears, if we believe the tenant is likely to vacate the property before making payment on those obligations. The amount of such property costs can vary quarter to quarter based on the timing of property vacancies and the level of underperforming properties; however, we do not anticipate that such costs will be significant to our operations. From time to time, we may also sell properties that no longer meet our long-term investment objectives.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements also include the funding needs associated with seven of our properties where we have agreed to provide construction financing or reimburse the tenant for certain development, construction and renovation costs in exchange for contractually specified interest or rent that generally increases in proportion with our funding. As of December 31, 2018, we had agreed to finance or reimburse development, construction or renovation costs in an aggregate amount of $34.4 million and, as of the same date, we had funded $14.9 million of this commitment. We expect to fund the balance of such commitment by December 31, 2019. Additionally, as of February 22, 2019, we were under contract to acquire 20 properties with an aggregate purchase price of $40.1 million, subject to completion of our due diligence procedures and customary closing conditions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including our investment in potential future acquisitions, primarily from cash and cash equivalents, net cash from operating activities and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional properties and repay indebtedness. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, net cash from operating activities, future financings, working capital, proceeds from select sales of our properties and other secured and unsecured borrowings (including potential issuances under the Master Trust Funding Program). However, at any point in time, there may be a number of factors that could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including unfavorable conditions in the overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base, borrowing restrictions imposed by our lenders, general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance, liquidity and market perceptions about us. The success of our business strategy will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to access these various capital sources.\nAn additional liquidity need is funding the distributions that are one of the requirements for qualification for taxation as a REIT. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our board of directors declared total cash distributions of $0.434 per share of common stock. Holders of OP Units are entitled to distributions equivalent to those paid by the Company to common stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid $14.1 million of distributions to common stockholders and OP Unit holders, and as of December 31, 2018, we recorded $13.2 million of distributions payable to common stockholders and OP Unit holders. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. As a result of this requirement, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our business needs to the same extent as other entities that are not REITs. If we do not have sufficient funds available to us from our operations to fund our business needs, we will need to find alternative ways to fund those needs. Such alternatives may include, among other things, selling properties (whether or not the sales price is optimal or otherwise meets our strategic long-term objectives), incurring additional indebtedness or issuing equity securities in public or private transactions. The availability and attractiveness of the terms of these potential sources of financing cannot be assured.\nDescription of Certain Debt\nMaster Trust Funding Program\nSCF RC Funding I LLC, SCF RC Funding II LLC and SCF RC Funding III LLC (collectively, the Master Trust Issuers\u201d), all of which are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, have issued net-lease mortgage notes payable (the Notes\u201d) with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $515.1 million as of December 31, 2018. The Notes are secured by all assets owned by the Master Trust Issuers. We provide property management services with respect to the mortgaged properties and service the related leases pursuant to an amended and restated property management and servicing agreement, dated as of July 11, 2017, among the Master Trust Issuers, the Operating Partnership (as property manager and as special servicer), Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National Association (as back-up manager) and Citibank, N.A. (as indenture trustee).\nBeginning in 2016, two series of Notes, each comprised of two classes, were issued under the program: (1) Notes originally issued by SCF RC Funding I LLC and SCF RC Funding II LLC (the Series 2016-1 Notes\u201d), with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $272.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and (2) Notes originally issued by SCF RC Funding I LLC, SCF RC Funding II LLC and SCF RC Funding III LLC (the Series 2017-1 Notes\u201d), with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $242.8 million as of December 31, 2018. The Notes are the joint obligations of all Master Trust Issuers.\nNotes issued under our Master Trust Funding Program are secured by a lien on all of the property owned by the Master Trust Issuers and the related leases. A substantial portion of our real estate investment portfolio serves as collateral for borrowings outstanding under our Master Trust Funding Program. As of December 31, 2018, we had pledged 347 properties, with a net investment amount of $609.2 million, under the Master Trust Funding Program. The agreement governing our Master Trust\nFunding Program permits substitution of real estate collateral from time to time, subject to certain conditions.\nAbsent a plan to issue additional long-term debt through the Master Trust Funding Program, we are not required to add assets to, or substitute collateral in, the existing collateral pool. We can voluntarily elect to substitute assets in the collateral pool, subject to meeting prescribed conditions that are designed to protect the collateral pool by requiring the substitute assets to be of equal or greater measure in attributes such as: the asset's fair value, monthly rent payments, remaining lease term and weighted average coverage ratios. In addition, we can sell underperforming assets and reinvest the proceeds in new properties. Any substitutions and sales are subject to an overall limitation of 35% of the collateral pool which is typically reset at each new issuance unless the substitution or sale is credit- or risk-based, in which case there are no limitations.\nA significant portion of our cash flows are generated by the special purpose entities comprising our Master Trust Funding Program. For the year ended December 31, 2018, excess cash flow from the Master Trust Funding Program, after payment of debt service and servicing and trustee expenses, totaled $18.3 million on cash collections of $50.9 million, which represents a debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the program documents) of 1.53 to 1. If at any time the monthly debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the program documents) generated by the collateral pool is less than or equal to 1.25 to 1, excess cash flow from the Master Trust Funding Program entities will be deposited into a reserve account to be used for payments to be made on the Notes, to the extent there is a shortfall; if at any time the three month average debt service coverage ratio generated by the collateral pool is less than or equal to 1.15 to 1, excess cash flow from the Master Trust Funding Program entities will be applied to an early amortization of the Notes. If cash generated by our properties held in the Master Trust Funding Program is required to be held in a reserve account or applied to an early amortization of the Notes, it would reduce the amount of cash available to us and could limit or eliminate our ability to make distributions to our common stockholders.\nThe Notes require monthly payments of principal and interest. The payment of principal and interest on any Class B Notes is subordinate to the payment of principal and interest on any Class A Notes. The Series 2016-1 Notes mature in November 2046 and have a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.51% as of December 31, 2018. However, the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2016-1 Notes is November 2021, and if the notes are not repaid in full on or before such anticipated repayment date, additional interest will begin to accrue on the notes. The Series 2017-1 Notes mature in June 2047 and have a weighted average interest rate of 4.17% as of December 31, 2018. However, the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2017-1 Notes is June 2024, and if the notes are not repaid in full on or before such anticipated repayment date, additional interest will begin to accrue on the notes.\nThe Series 2016-1 Notes may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the date that is 24 months prior to the anticipated repayment date in November 2021 without the payment of a make whole amount. Voluntary prepayments may be made before 24 months prior to the anticipated repayment date but will be subject to the payment of a make whole amount.\nThe Series 2017-1 Notes may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the date that is 31 months prior to the anticipated repayment date in June 2024 without the payment of a make whole amount. Voluntary prepayments may be made before 31 months prior to the anticipated repayment date but will be subject to the payment of a make whole amount.\nAn event of default will occur if, among other things, the Master Trust Issuers fail to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due, materially default in compliance with the material covenants contained in the documents evidencing the Notes or the mortgages on the mortgaged property collateral or if a bankruptcy or other insolvency event occurs. Under the master trust indenture, we have a number of Master Trust Issuer covenants, including requirements to pay any taxes and other charges levied or imposed upon the Master Trust Issuers and to comply with specified insurance requirements. We are also required to ensure that all uses and operations on or of our properties comply in all material respects with\nall applicable environmental laws. As of December 31, 2018, we were in material compliance with all such covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2018, scheduled principal repayments on the Notes issued under the Master Trust Funding Program for 2019 are $8.0 million. We expect to meet these repayment requirements primarily through our net cash from operating activities.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn June 25, 2018, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility with a group of lenders, which provides senior unsecured revolving credit in the maximum aggregate initial original principal amount of up to $300.0 million. Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA were the joint lead arrangers of the facility, with Barclays Bank PLC acting as administrative agent. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2018, we had $34.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $266.0 million of unused borrowing capacity.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility has a term of four years from the original closing date with an extension option of up to 12-months exercisable by us, subject to certain conditions, and initially bears interest at an annual rate of (i) applicable LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 1.45% and 2.15%; or (ii) the base rate (which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus an applicable margin of between 0.45% and 1.15%. The applicable LIBOR is the rate with a term equivalent to the interest period applicable to the relevant borrowing. The applicable margin is initially a spread set according to a leverage-based pricing grid. At our election, on and after receipt of an investment grade corporate credit rating from S&P or Moody's, the applicable margin will be a spread set according to our corporate credit ratings by S&P and/or Moody's. The Revolving Credit Facility is freely prepayable at any time and will be mandatorily prepayable if borrowings exceed the borrowing base or the facility limit. We may re-borrow amounts paid down, subject to customary borrowing conditions. We are required to pay revolving credit commitment fees throughout the term of the Revolving Credit Facility based upon our usage of the Revolving Credit Facility, at a rate which depends on our usage of the Revolving Credit Facility during the period before we receive an investment grade corporate credit rating from S&P or Moody's, and which rate shall be based on the corporate credit rating from S&P and/or Moody's after the time, if applicable, we receive such a rating. However, there can be no assurance that we will receive an investment grade corporate rating from S&P and/or Moody's. The Revolving Credit Facility provides an accordion feature to increase, subject to certain conditions, the maximum availability of the facility by up to an additional $200.0 million.\nThe Operating Partnership is the borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility, and we and each of the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that owns a direct or indirect interest in an eligible real property asset are guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe are subject to financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility, including maintaining: a limitation on total consolidated leverage of not more than 60% of the total value of certain of our assets (including unencumbered cash and cash equivalents, the value of real property assets, mortgage notes receivable and up to $10 million of construction or redevelopment costs) ( Total Consolidated Assets\u201d) with a step up on two non-consecutive occasions to 65%, at our election, for two consecutive quarters each following a material acquisition; a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50x; a consolidated tangible net worth of at least 75% of our tangible net worth at the date of the facility plus 75% of future net equity proceeds; a consolidated secured leverage ratio of not more than 50% of our Total Consolidated Assets; a secured recourse debt ratio of not more than 10% of our Total Consolidated Assets; an unencumbered leverage ratio of not more than 60% of our consolidated unencumbered real property and mortgage notes receivable with a step up on two non-consecutive occasions to 65%, at our election, for two consecutive quarters each following a material acquisition; and an unencumbered interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75x.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility restricts our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders under certain circumstances. In particular, we are generally limited to paying cash distributions with respect to\nany period of four fiscal quarters in an amount not to exceed the greater of (i) 95% of adjusted funds from operations (as defined in the credit agreement), or (ii) the amount required for us to maintain our status as a REIT, and such cash distributions may be further limited during events of default. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants that, subject to exceptions, limits or restricts, among other things, our incurrence of indebtedness and liens, disposition of assets, transactions with affiliates, mergers and fundamental changes, modification of organizational documents, changes to fiscal periods, making of investments, negative pledge clauses and lines of business and REIT qualification.\nCash Flows\nThe following discussion of changes in cash flows includes the results of the Company and the Predecessor collectively for the periods presented.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $4.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $12.0 million of restricted cash as compared to $7.3 million and $12.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and $1.8 million and $10.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2018\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $45.9 million. Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the rental rates specified in our leases, the collectability of rent and the level of our operating expenses and other general and administrative costs. Cash inflows related to a net income adjusted for non-cash items of $48.3 million (net income of $20.6 million adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, provision for impairment of real estate, gains on dispositions of investments, net, straight-line rent receivable, equity-based compensation and allowance for doubtful accounts, of $27.7 million). These cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in accrued liabilities and other payables and an increase of $0.8 million in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $461.9 million. Our net cash used in investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions, the development of our construction in progress, investments in loans receivable and, to a limited extent, capital expenditures, offset by cash provided from the disposition of real estate and principal collections on our direct financing receivables. The cash used in investing activities included $488.4 million to acquire investments in real estate, $15.3 million to fund construction in progress, $14.9 million of investments in loans receivable, $1.7 million for capital expenditures subsequent to acquisition, $0.5 million paid to tenants as lease incentives and an increase of $1.7 million in deposits on prospective real estate investments. These cash outflows were partially offset by $60.4 million of proceeds from sales of investments, net of disposition costs, and $0.1 million of principal collections on our direct financing lease receivables.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $412.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to cash inflows of $464.2 million from the issuance of common stock in the IPO (inclusive of the shares issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares), $109.0 million from the Concurrent Private Placement of common stock, $16.0 million from the Concurrent Private Placement of OP Units, $154.0 million from the issuance of notes payable to related parties, $34.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and $50.0 million of capital contributions to the Predecessor. These cash inflows were partially offset by the payment of $5.5 million of IPO costs, $384.0 million of payments of principal on notes payable to related parties, $7.8 million of repayments of secured borrowing principal, payment of $3.1 million of deferred financing costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility and the payment of $14.1 million in dividends.\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2017\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $22.5 million. Cash inflows related to a net income adjusted for non-cash items of $20.7 million (net income of $6.3 million adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, provision for impairment of real estate, gains on dispositions of investments, net, straight-line rent receivable, equity-based compensation and allowance for doubtful accounts of $14.4 million) and a $4.1 million increase in accrued liabilities and other payables. These cash inflows were partially offset by a net increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $464.4 million. The cash used in investing activities included $509.8 million to acquire investments in real estate, $7.7 million to fund construction in progress, $0.3 million paid to tenants as lease incentives, $0.3 million paid for deposits on prospective real estate investments and approximately $48,000 for capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by $53.6 million of proceeds from sales of investments, net of disposition costs, and $0.1 million of principal collections on our direct financing lease receivables.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $449.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to cash inflows of $543.0 million from the issuance of notes payable to related parties, $248.1 million of proceeds from secured borrowings under our Master Trust Funding Program and $83.7 million of capital contributions to the Predecessor. These cash inflows were partially offset by $313.0 million of payments of principal on notes payable to related parties, $101.2 million of equity distributions by the Predecessor, $5.6 million of repayments of secured borrowing principal and $5.6 million of deferred financing costs.\nCash Flows for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016\nDuring the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.5 million. Cash inflows related to a net income adjusted for non-cash items of $8.6 million (net income of $3.8 million adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, provision for impairment of real estate, gains on dispositions of investments, net, and straight-line rent receivable of $4.8 million) and a $2.4 million increase in accrued liabilities and other payables. These cash inflows were partially offset by a net increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016 was $279.1 million. The cash used in investing activities included $288.9 million to acquire investments in real estate, $3.7 million to acquire investments in direct financing receivables, $2.0 million paid to tenants as lease incentives, $1.0 million to fund construction in progress and $0.1 million paid for deposits on prospective real estate investments. These cash outflows were partially offset by $16.5 million of proceeds from sales of investments, net of disposition costs, and approximately $37,000 of principal collections on our direct financing lease receivables.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $280.5 million during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016 related to cash inflows of $288.6 million of capital contributions to the Predecessor and $7.5 million of proceeds from secured borrowings under our Master Trust Funding Program. These cash inflows were partially offset by $7.7 million of deferred financing costs, $7.5 million of equity distributions by the Predecessor and $0.3 million of repayments of secured borrowing principal.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table provides information with respect to our commitments as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 - 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2022 - 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured Borrowings-Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 515,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 275,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 222,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured Borrowings-Fixed Interest (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Credit Facility (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tenant Construction Financing and\nReimbursement Obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Lease Obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 663,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 320,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 228,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes interest payments on outstanding indebtedness issued under the Master Trust Funding Program through the anticipated repayment dates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2018, balances on the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate of prime rate plus a leverage-based credit spread of 0.45%.

These commitments generally have terms of one-year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.\nWe intend to elect to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018; accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided we distribute all of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, to our stockholders.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur accounting policies are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially from our estimates. Estimates and assumptions include, among other things, subjective judgments regarding the fair values and useful lives of our properties for depreciation and lease classification purposes, the collectability of receivables and asset impairment analysis. Set forth below are the more critical accounting policies that require management judgment and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nReal Estate Investments\nInvestments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of investments in real estate reflects their purchase price or development cost. We evaluate each acquisition transaction to determine whether the acquired asset meets the definition of a business. Under Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805):\nClarifying the Definition of a Business, an acquisition does not qualify as a business when there is no substantive process acquired or substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets or the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay. Transaction costs related to acquisitions that are asset acquisitions are capitalized as part of the cost basis of the acquired assets, while transaction costs for acquisitions that are deemed to be acquisitions of a business are expensed as incurred. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life or improve the productive capacity of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired properties accounted for as asset acquisitions to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on their relative fair values. Tangible assets may include land, site improvements and buildings. Intangible assets may include the value of in-place leases and above- and below-market leases and other identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics.\nWe incur various costs in the leasing and development of our properties. Amounts paid to tenants that incentivize them to extend or otherwise amend an existing lease or to sign a new lease agreement are capitalized to lease incentive on our consolidated balance sheets. Tenant improvements are capitalized to building and improvements within our consolidated balance sheets. Costs incurred which are directly related to properties under development, which include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs and real estate taxes and insurance, are capitalized during the period of development as construction in progress. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that benefited. Determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project has reached substantial completion and is available for occupancy and capitalization must cease, involves a degree of judgment. We do not engage in speculative real estate development. We do, however, opportunistically agree to reimburse certain of our tenants for development costs at our properties in exchange for contractually specified rent that generally increases proportionally with our funding.\nThe fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant\u201d value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on the fair value of the tangible assets. The fair value of in-place leases is determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases based on the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. We estimate the cost to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in-place leases, including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Factors we consider in this analysis include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses, and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which primarily range from six to 12 months. The fair value of above- or below-market leases is recorded based on the net present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and our estimate of the fair market lease rate for the corresponding in-place lease, measured over the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease including any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including real estate valuations prepared by independent valuation firms. We also consider information and other factors including market conditions, the industry that the tenant operates in, characteristics of the real estate, e.g., location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant's business. Additionally, we consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. We use the information obtained as a result of our pre-acquisition due\ndiligence as part of our consideration of the accounting standard governing asset retirement obligations and, when necessary, will record an asset retirement obligation as part of the purchase price allocation.\nReal estate investments that are intended to be sold are designated as held for sale\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale. Real estate investments are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale. If the disposal, or intended disposal, of certain real estate investments represents a strategic shift that has had or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results, the operations of such real estate investments would be presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for all applicable periods.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and 15 years for site improvements.\nLease incentives are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the lease incentive is charged to rental revenue.\nConstruction in progress is not depreciated until the development has reached substantial completion.\nTenant improvements are depreciated over the non-cancellable term of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter.\nCapitalized above-market lease values are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental revenue over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market lease values are accreted on a straight-line basis as an increase to rental revenue over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases including any below-market fixed rate renewal option periods.\nCapitalized above-market ground lease values are accreted as a reduction of property expenses over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property expenses over the remaining terms of the respective leases and any expected below-market renewal option periods where renewal is considered probable.\nThe value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market lease intangibles, is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining periods of the respective leases.\nIf a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of each intangible, including in-place lease values, is charged to depreciation and amortization expense, while above- and below-market lease adjustments are recorded within rental revenue in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.\nLoans Receivable\nWe hold our loans receivable for long-term investment. Loans receivable are carried at amortized cost, including related unamortized discounts or premiums, if any. We recognize interest income on loans receivable using the effective-interest method applied on a loan-by-loan basis. Direct costs associated with originating loans are offset against any related fees received and the balance, along with any premium or discount, is deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the term of the related loan receivable using the effective-interest method.\nWe periodically evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable, including accrued interest, by analyzing the underlying property-level economics and trends, collateral value and quality and other relevant factors in determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. A loan is determined to be impaired when, in management's judgment based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Specific allowances for loan losses are provided for impaired loans on an individual loan basis in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less disposition costs.\nDirect Financing Lease Receivables\nCertain of our real estate investment transactions are accounted for as direct financing leases. We record the direct financing lease receivables at their net investment, determined as the aggregate minimum lease payments and the estimated non-guaranteed residual value of the leased property less unearned income. The unearned income is recognized over the life of the related lease contracts so as to produce a constant rate of return on the net investment in the asset. Our investment in direct financing lease receivables is reduced over the applicable lease term to its non-guaranteed residual value by the portion of rent allocated to the direct financing lease receivables.\nIf and when an investment in direct financing lease receivables is identified for impairment evaluation, we will apply the guidance in both the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 310, Receivables ( ASC 310\u201d) and ASC 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d). Under ASC 310, the lease receivable portion of the net investment in a direct financing lease receivable is evaluated for impairment when it becomes probable we, as the lessor, will be unable to collect all rental payments associated with our investment in the direct financing lease receivable. Under ASC 840, we review the estimated non-guaranteed residual value of a leased property at least annually. If the review results in a lower estimate than had been previously established, we determine whether the decline in estimated non-guaranteed residual value is other than temporary. If a decline is judged to be other than temporary, the accounting for the transaction is revised using the changed estimate and the resulting reduction in the net investment in direct financing lease receivables is recognized by us as a loss in the period in which the estimate is changed.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIf circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. Impairment assessments have a direct impact on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. If the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the accounts receivable and straight-line rent receivable balances are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts on the consolidated balance sheets or a direct write-off of the receivable is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The provision for doubtful accounts is included in property expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. If the accounts receivable balance or\nstraight-line rent receivable balance is subsequently deemed to be uncollectible, such receivable amounts are written-off to the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur rental revenue is primarily related to rent received from tenants. Rent from tenants is recorded in accordance with the terms of each lease on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable initial term of the lease from the later of the date of the commencement of the lease or the date of acquisition of the property subject to the lease. Rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant controls the space and continues through the term of the related lease. Because substantially all of the leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, we record a straight-line rent receivable and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis through the expiration of the non-cancellable term of the lease. We take into account whether the collectability of rents is reasonably assured in determining the amount of straight-line rent to record.\nWe defer rental revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. These amounts are presented within accrued liabilities and other payables on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain properties in our investment portfolio are subject to leases that provide for contingent rent based on a percentage of the tenant's gross sales. For these leases, we recognize contingent rental revenue when the threshold upon which the contingent lease payment is based is actually reached.\nGains and Losses on Dispositions of Real Estate\nThrough December 31, 2017, gains and losses on dispositions of real estate investments were recorded in accordance with ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment-Real Estate Sales, and include realized proceeds from real estate disposed of in the ordinary course of business, less their related net book value and less any costs incurred in association with the disposition.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-05, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets\u201d ( ASU 2017-05\u201d), using the modified retrospective transition method. As leasing is our primary activity, we determined that our sales of real estate, which are nonfinancial assets, are sold to noncustomers and fall within the scope of ASC 610-20. We recognize the full gain on the disposition of our real estate investments as we (i) have no controlling financial interest in the real estate and (ii) have no continuing interest or obligation with respect to the disposed real estate. We re-assessed and determined there were no open contracts or partial sales and, as such, the adoption of ASU 2017-05 (i) did not result in a cumulative adjustment as of January 1, 2018 and (ii) did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that 90% of ordinary REIT taxable income\u201d (as determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gains) be distributed. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent that we meet the organizational and operational requirements and our distributions equal or exceed REIT taxable income. For the period subsequent to the effective date of our intended REIT election, we intend to meet the organizational and operational requirements and expect distributions to exceed net taxable income. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal income taxes. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to state and local income and franchise taxes, and to federal income and excise tax on our undistributed income. Franchise taxes and federal excise taxes on our undistributed income, if any, are included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income. Additionally, taxable income from our non-REIT activities managed through our taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal, state and local taxes.\nFrom the Predecessor's commencement of operations on March 30, 2016 through January 31, 2017, the Predecessor and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements were treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, and, accordingly, the Predecessor was not subject to entity-level tax. Therefore, until the Predecessor's issuance of Class A and Class C units on January 31, 2017, the Predecessor's net income flowed through to SCF Funding LLC, its initial sole member, for federal income tax purposes. Following the issuance of Class A and Class C units, the Predecessor's net income flowed through to Class A and Class C unitholders for federal income tax purposes. With regard to state income taxes, the Predecessor was a taxable entity only in certain states that tax all entities, including partnerships.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in such jurisdictions. We follow a two-step process to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Step one, recognition, occurs when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Step two, measurement, determines the amount of benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when we subsequently determine that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. The use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions is prohibited.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nIn 2018, we granted shares of restricted common stock to our directors, executive officers and other employees that vest over a multi-year period, subject to the recipient's continued service. In 2017, the Predecessor granted unit-based compensation awards to certain of its employees and managers, as well as non-employees, consisting of units that vest over a multi-year period, subject to the recipient's continued service. We account for the restricted common stock and unit-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires that such compensation be recognized in the financial statements based on their estimated grant-date fair value. The value of such awards is recognized as compensation expense in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service periods.\nWe recognize compensation expense for equity-based compensation using the straight-line method based on the terms of the individual grant.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe FASB provides guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity (a VIE\u201d). VIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. A VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that (i) has the power to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nFollowing the completion of the Formation Transactions, we concluded that the Operating Partnership is a VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary, as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Operating Partnership. Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are held by the Operating Partnership. The assets and liabilities of the Operating Partnership are consolidated and reported as assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nWe have concluded that an entity which we have provided a $5.7 million mortgage loan receivable is a VIE because the terms of the loan agreement limit the entity's ability to absorb expected losses or the\nentity's right to receive expected residual returns. However, we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity, because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying amount of our loan receivable with this entity was $5.7 million, and our maximum exposure to loss in this entity is limited to the carrying amount of our investment. We had no liabilities associated with this investment as of December 31, 2018.\nNet Income per Share\nWe compute net income per share pursuant to the guidance in the FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The guidance requires the classification of our unvested restricted common stock, which contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing net income per share. Diluted net income per share of common stock further considers the effect of potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The OP Units held by non-controlling interests represent potentially dilutive securities as the OP Units may be redeemed for cash or, at our election, exchanged for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, with subsequent updates in 2015, 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which establishes a principles-based approach for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. The standard does not apply to revenue recognition for lease contracts or to the interest income recognized from direct financing receivables, which together represent substantially all of our revenue. Such revenues are related to lease contracts with tenants, which currently fall within the scope of ASC Topic 840 and will fall within the scope of ASC Topic 842 upon the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 (see below). Our sales of real estate are within the scope of ASU 2017-05 (see above). We adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for transition. The adoption of this new standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2018 and did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d) to amend the accounting for leases. The new standard requires lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases based on certain criteria and record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months, regardless of their classification. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to the previous guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The standard also eliminates current real estate-specific provisions and changes the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs, lease modifications and lease executory costs for all entities. Certain changes to the guidance pertaining to sale-leaseback transactions may impact us. For example, the inclusion of a purchase option in the lease associated with a sale-leaseback transaction will now result in the lessor accounting for such transaction as a financing arrangement.\nASU 2016-02 was effective for us on January 1, 2019 and, in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, was adopted by us using the modified retrospective approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption. There was no impact to retained earnings at the time of adoption and, therefore, no cumulative-effect adjustment was recorded. At the time of adoption, both lessees and lessors are permitted to make an election to apply a package of practical expedients available for implementation under the standard. We applied this package of practical expedients and, as such, at the time of adoption did not reassess the classification of existing lease contracts, whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease or whether a portion of initial direct costs for existing leases should have been expensed. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged under ASU 2016-02; however, the standard requires that lessors expense, on an as-incurred basis, certain initial direct costs that are not incremental in obtaining a lease. Under the previous standards, certain of these costs were capitalizable. Although primarily a lessor, we are also a lessee under several ground lease arrangements and under our corporate office and office equipment leases. We have completed our inventory and evaluation of these leases and have calculated a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for the present value of the minimum lease payments; the amount recognized upon\nadoption was less than 1% of total assets. For a portion of our ground lease arrangements, the sublessees, or our tenants, are responsible for making payment directly to the ground lessors. Prior to the new standard such amounts were presented on a net basis; however, upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 the expense related to the ground lease obligations, along with the related sublease revenues, will be presented on a gross basis in the consolidated statements of income. ASU 2016-02 also requires additional disclosures within the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements.\nSubstantially all of our lease contracts (under which we are the lessor) are triple-net\u201d leases, which means that our tenants are responsible for making payments to third parties for operating expenses such as property taxes and insurance costs associated with the properties we lease to them. Under the previous lease accounting guidance, these payments were excluded from rental revenue. In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-20 Leases (Topic 842), Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors. This update requires us to exclude from variable lease payments, and therefore revenue and expense, costs paid by our tenants directly to third parties (a net presentation). Costs paid by us and reimbursed by our tenants will be included in variable lease payments (a gross presentation)\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d), which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees, with the result of aligning the guidance on share-based payments to nonemployees with that for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions, and eliminating the need to re-value awards to nonemployees at each balance sheet date. ASU 2018-07 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted for companies who have previously adopted ASU 2017-09. We early adopted ASU 2018-07 effective July 1, 2018 for accounting for our liability-classified non-employee awards that had not vested as of that date. No adjustment to our retained earnings was required as a result of the adoption of ASU 2018-07.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement: Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d), which changes the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, adding and modifying certain disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2018-13 on our related disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion includes the results of the Company's and the Predecessor's

Rental revenue increased by $41.6 million to $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in rental revenue was primarily due to our acquisition of properties during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which provided $19.0 million and $22.2 million of additional rental revenue between the comparison periods, net of a reduction in rental revenue due to sale of properties during the comparison periods, and an increase in the net accretion of above- and below- market lease intangibles to revenue of $0.3 million between the comparison periods.\nInterest income on loans and direct financing receivables. Interest income on loans and direct financing receivables increased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to our initial investments in loans receivable during 2018.\nOther revenue. Other revenue decreased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in lease termination income during the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset\nby having a full year of expense reimbursement income on two properties that were acquired in September 2017.\nExpenses:\nInterest. Interest expense increased by $7.6 million to $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to $5.6 million of additional interest expense from having notes issued under our Master Trust Funding Program on July 11, 2017 outstanding during the entire year ended December 31, 2018, $0.9 million of new interest expense relating to the Revolving Credit Facility that was entered into in June 2018 and $1.1 million of additional interest expense on our notes payable to related parties due to higher average borrowing balances during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $5.0 million to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in stock compensation expense of $1.6 million, directors' fees of $0.2 million, legal and accounting fees of $1.4 million, personnel costs of $1.2 million and other costs required to support our growing real estate portfolio.\nProperty expenses. Property expenses increased by $0.4 million to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to having a full year of reimbursable property expense on two properties that were acquired in September 2017. Our leases are generally triple-net and provide that the tenant is responsible for the payment of all property-level expenses, such as maintenance, insurance, utility and tax expense, related to the leased property. Therefore, we are generally not responsible for operating costs related to the properties, unless a property is not subject to a triple-net lease or is vacant. Barring any significant changes in occupancy or composition of triple net leases in our portfolio between the comparison periods, we expect property expenses to remain fairly consistent.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to depreciation on the properties and improvements we own and to amortization of the related lease intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $11.9 million to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to the inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense for properties acquired during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 which added $5.6 million and $8.0 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $1.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense on properties that we disposed during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProvision for impairment of real estate. Impairment charges on real estate investments were $4.5 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a provision for impairment of real estate at 20 and nine of our real estate investments. We strategically seek to identify non-performing properties that we may re-lease or dispose of in an effort to improve our returns and manage risk exposure. An increase in vacancy associated with our disposition or re-leasing strategies may trigger impairment charges when the expected future cash flows from the properties from sale or re-lease are less than their net book value.\nOther operating income:\nGain on dispositions of real estate, net. Gain on dispositions of real estate, net decreased by $1.3 million to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We disposed of 45 real estate properties during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 47 real estate properties during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther income and expenses:\nInterest. Interest income increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average daily cash balances in our interest-bearing bank accounts during the year ended December 31, 2018 because of the funds raised through the IPO (inclusive of the shares issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares) and the Concurrent Private Placement of common stock to Eldridge.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense increased by approximately $34,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. As we are organized and operate with the intention of qualifying as a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal taxation. However, the Operating Partnership is subject to taxation in certain state and local jurisdictions that impose income taxes on a partnership. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the continued growth of our real estate investment portfolio and our expansion into new jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the portion of our net income attributable to the holders of units in our Operating Partnership, which are accounted for as non-controlling interests. No such non-controlling interests existed during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to

Rental revenue increased by $38.1 million to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $15.3 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in rental revenue was primarily due to our acquisition of 212 properties during the year ended December 31, 2017, which provided $17.6 million of additional\nrental revenue between the comparison periods, contractual rent escalations and the inclusion of a full year of operations from properties acquired during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016, which contributed $20.5 million of additional rental revenue between the comparison periods.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 98.8% of our properties were occupied. We regularly review and analyze the operational and financial condition of our tenants and the industries in which they operate in order to identify underperforming properties that we may seek to dispose of in an effort to mitigate risks in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, exclusive of two vacant land parcels that we own, six of our properties, representing 1.2% of our portfolio, were vacant and not generating rent, compared to 11 vacant properties, representing 3.2% of our portfolio, as of December 31, 2016.\nInterest income on loans and direct financing receivables. Interest income on loans and direct financing receivables increased by $0.1 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $0.2 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December31, 2016. The increase in interest income on direct financing receivables was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations from our eight investments in direct financing receivables acquired during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016 (net of disposition or termination of two direct financing leases during the year ended December 31, 2017).\nOther revenue. Other revenue increased by $0.7 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $0.1 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in other revenue was primarily due to the receipt of $0.7 million of lease termination fees from former tenants during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nExpenses:\nInterest. Interest expense increased by $21.6 million to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.0 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to $11.8 million of additional interest expense from having $280.8 million of notes issued under our Master Trust Funding Program in December 2016 outstanding for a full year, $8.0 million of additional interest expense on debt issued to finance acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017 and $1.8 million of additional non-cash interest expense from the amortization of deferred financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we issued an additional $248.1 million of notes under our Master Trust Funding Program and had net borrowings of $230.0 million through short-term notes with related parties.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $4.5 million to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $4.3 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. This increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operations and increased costs required to support our larger real estate investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProperty expenses. Property expenses increased by $1.0 million to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.5 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in property costs was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations and related property expenses for our vacant properties during the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by reduced property expenses due to a net four property decrease in our total number of vacant properties during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $14.1 million to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $5.4 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations and related depreciation and amortization expense from properties acquired during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016, which added $8.6 million of additional\ndepreciation and amortization expense, and $5.5 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense recorded on the 212 properties that we acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProvision for impairment of real estate. Impairment charges on real estate investments were $2.4 million and $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provision for impairment of real estate at nine of our real estate investments, compared to seven real estate investments during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016.\nOther operating income:\nGain on dispositions of real estate, net. Gain on dispositions of real estate, net increased by $5.9 million to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.9 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in gain on dispositions of real estate was primarily due to our disposition of 47 real estate properties during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to our disposition of 17 properties during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016.\nOther income and expenses:\nInterest. Interest income increased by approximately $46,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average daily cash balances in our interest-bearing bank accounts during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense increased by $0.1 million to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.1 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The Predecessor was subject to taxation in certain state and local jurisdictions that impose income taxes on a partnership. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the continued growth of our real estate investment portfolio and our expansion into new jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose the following non-GAAP financial measures: funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), EBITDA further adjusted to exclude gains (or losses) on sales of depreciable property and real estate impairment losses ( EBITDAre\u201d), net debt, net operating income ( NOI\u201d) and cash NOI ( Cash NOI\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs.\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gain or loss from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets and real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO is used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales (which are dependent on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions).\nTo derive AFFO, we modify the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance, including straight-line rental revenue, non-cash interest expense, non-cash compensation expense, amortization of market lease-related intangibles, amortization of capitalized lease incentives, capitalized interest expense, transaction costs and other non-cash charges. Such items may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on operating cash flows or long-term operating performance. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by non-cash and certain other revenues and expenses.\nFFO and AFFO do not include all items of revenue and expense included in net income, nor do they represent cash generated from operating activities, and they are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO and AFFO attributable to stockholders and members and non-controlling interests:\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for impairment of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on dispositions of real estate, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,445\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,748\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (871\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO attributable to stockholders and members and\nnon-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Straight-line rental revenue, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,214\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,254\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,244\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of market lease-related intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of capitalized lease incentives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (225\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (242\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-cash charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AFFO attributable to stockholders and members and\nnon-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe calculate EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. In 2017, NAREIT issued a white paper recommending that companies that report EBITDA also report EBITDAre. We compute EBITDAre in accordance with the definition adopted by NAREIT. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding gains (or losses) from the sales of depreciable property and real estate impairment losses. We present EBITDA and EBITDAre as they are measures commonly used in our industry and we believe that these measures are useful to investors and analysts because they provide important supplemental information concerning our operating performance, exclusive of certain non-cash items and other costs. We use EBITDA and EBITDAre as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity.\nEBITDA and EBITDAre are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and our EBITDA and EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. You should not consider EBITDA and EBITDAre as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to EBITDA and EBITDAre attributable to stockholders and members and non-controlling interests:\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (930\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA attributable to stockholders and members\nand non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for impairment of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on dispositions of real estate, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,445\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,748\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (871\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDAre attributable to stockholders and members\nand non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe adjust EBITDAre for our most recently completed fiscal quarter based on an estimate calculated as if all acquisition and disposition activity that took place during the quarter had been made on the first day of the quarter ( Adjusted EBITDAre\u201d). We then annualize Adjusted EBITDAre by multiplying it by four ( Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre\u201d), which we believe provides a meaningful estimate of our current run rate for all properties owned as of the date of this report. You should not unduly rely on this measure as it is based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate.

</tr>\n</table>\nAn additional liquidity need is funding the distributions that are one of the requirements for qualification for taxation as a REIT. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our board of directors declared total cash distributions of $0.434 per share of common stock. Holders of OP Units are entitled to distributions equivalent to those paid by the Company to common stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid $14.1 million of distributions to common stockholders and OP Unit holders, and as of December 31, 2018, we recorded $13.2 million of distributions payable to common stockholders and OP Unit holders. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. As a result of this requirement, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our business needs to the same extent as other entities that are not REITs. If we do not have sufficient funds available to us from our operations to fund our business needs, we will need to find alternative ways to fund those needs. Such alternatives may include, among other things, selling properties (whether or not the sales price is optimal or otherwise meets our strategic long-term objectives), incurring additional indebtedness or issuing equity securities in public or private transactions. The availability and attractiveness of the terms of these potential sources of financing cannot be assured.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense increased by approximately $34,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. As we are organized and operate with the intention of qualifying as a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal taxation. However, the Operating Partnership is subject to taxation in certain state and local jurisdictions that impose income taxes on a partnership. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the continued growth of our real estate investment portfolio and our expansion into new jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation.\nGain on dispositions of real estate, net. Gain on dispositions of real estate, net increased by $5.9 million to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.9 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in gain on dispositions of real estate was primarily due to our disposition of 47 real estate properties during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to our disposition of 17 properties during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016.\nThe FASB provides guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity (a VIE\u201d). VIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. A VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that (i) has the power to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nSubstantially all of our leases provide for periodic contractual rent escalations. As of December 31, 2018, leases contributing 97.1% of our annualized base rent provided for increases in future annual base rent, generally ranging from 1% to 4% annually, with a weighted average annual escalation equal to 1.5% of base rent. As of December 31, 2018, leases contributing 91.9% of annualized base rent were triple-net, which means that our tenant is responsible for all operating expenses, such as maintenance, insurance, utility and tax expense, related to the leased property (including any increases in those costs that may occur as a result of inflation). Our remaining leases were double net,\u201d where the tenant is responsible for certain expenses, such as taxes and insurance, but we retain responsibility for other expenses, generally related to maintenance and structural component replacement that may be required on such leased properties in the future. Also, we incur property-level expenses associated with our vacant properties and we occasionally incur nominal property-level expenses that are not paid by our tenants, such as the costs of periodically making site inspections of our properties. Since our properties are predominantly single-tenant properties, which are generally subject to long-term leases, it is not necessary for us to perform any significant ongoing leasing activities on our properties. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted average remaining term of our leases was 14.2 years (based on annualized base rent), excluding renewal options that have not been exercised, with 3.1% of our annualized base rent attributable to leases expiring prior to January 1, 2023. Renewal options are exercisable at the option of our tenants upon expiration of their base lease term. Our leases providing for tenant renewal options generally provide for periodic contractual rent escalations during any renewed term that are similar to those applicable during the initial term of the lease.\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

For the year ended December 31, 2018, excess cash flow from the Master Trust Funding Program, after payment of debt service and servicing and trustee expenses, totaled $18.3 million on cash collections of $50.9 million, which represents a debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the program documents) of 1.53 to 1. If at any time the monthly debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the program documents) generated by the collateral pool is less than or equal to 1.25 to 1, excess cash flow from the Master Trust Funding Program entities will be deposited into a reserve account to be used for payments to be made on the Notes, to the extent there is a shortfall; if at any time the three month average debt service coverage ratio generated by the collateral pool is less than or equal to 1.15 to 1, excess cash flow from the Master Trust Funding Program entities will be applied to an early amortization of the Notes. If cash generated by our properties held in the Master Trust Funding Program is required to be held in a reserve account or applied to an early amortization of the Notes, it would reduce the amount of cash available to us and could limit or eliminate our ability to make distributions to our common stockholders.\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2017\nIf circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. Impairment assessments have a direct impact on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\n\nWe hold our loans receivable for long-term investment. Loans receivable are carried at amortized cost, including related unamortized discounts or premiums, if any. We recognize interest income on loans receivable using the effective-interest method applied on a loan-by-loan basis. Direct costs associated with originating loans are offset against any related fees received and the balance, along with any premium or discount, is deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the term of the related loan receivable using the effective-interest method.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $449.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to cash inflows of $543.0 million from the issuance of notes payable to related parties, $248.1 million of proceeds from secured borrowings under our Master Trust Funding Program and $83.7 million of capital contributions to the Predecessor. These cash inflows were partially offset by $313.0 million of payments of principal on notes payable to related parties, $101.2 million of equity distributions by the Predecessor, $5.6 million of repayments of secured borrowing principal and $5.6 million of deferred financing costs.\nWe are subject to financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility, including maintaining: a limitation on total consolidated leverage of not more than 60% of the total value of certain of our assets (including unencumbered cash and cash equivalents, the value of real property assets, mortgage notes receivable and up to $10 million of construction or redevelopment costs) ( Total Consolidated Assets\u201d) with a step up on two non-consecutive occasions to 65%, at our election, for two consecutive quarters each following a material acquisition; a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50x; a consolidated tangible net worth of at least 75% of our tangible net worth at the date of the facility plus 75% of future net equity proceeds; a consolidated secured leverage ratio of not more than 50% of our Total Consolidated Assets; a secured recourse debt ratio of not more than 10% of our Total Consolidated Assets; an unencumbered leverage ratio of not more than 60% of our consolidated unencumbered real property and mortgage notes receivable with a step up on two non-consecutive occasions to 65%, at our election, for two consecutive quarters each following a material acquisition; and an unencumbered interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75x.\nBy seeking to match the expected cash inflows from our long-term leases with the expected cash outflows for our long-term, fixed-rate debt, we seek to lock in,\u201d for as long as is economically feasible, the expected positive difference between our scheduled cash inflows on the leases and the cash outflows on our debt obligations. In this way, we seek to reduce the risk that increases in interest rates would adversely impact our results of operations. Although we are not required to maintain a particular leverage ratio and may not be able to do so, we generally intend to target, over time, a level of net debt (which includes recourse and non-recourse borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock less unrestricted cash and cash held for the benefit of lenders) that is less than six times our annualized adjusted EBITDAre.\nEBITDA and EBITDAre are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and our EBITDA and EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. You should not consider EBITDA and EBITDAre as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP.\nProperty expenses. Property expenses increased by $0.4 million to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to having a full year of reimbursable property expense on two properties that were acquired in September 2017. Our leases are generally triple-net and provide that the tenant is responsible for the payment of all property-level expenses, such as maintenance, insurance, utility and tax expense, related to the leased property. Therefore, we are generally not responsible for operating costs related to the properties, unless a property is not subject to a triple-net lease or is vacant. Barring any significant changes in occupancy or composition of triple net leases in our portfolio between the comparison periods, we expect property expenses to remain fairly consistent.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and 15 years for site improvements.\nThe following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre attributable to stockholders and members and non-controlling interests for the three months ended December 31, 2018:\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2018\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense increased by $0.1 million to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.1 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The Predecessor was subject to taxation in certain state and local jurisdictions that impose income taxes on a partnership. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the continued growth of our real estate investment portfolio and our expansion into new jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation.\nMaster Trust Funding Program\nNet cash used in investing activities during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016 was $279.1 million. The cash used in investing activities included $288.9 million to acquire investments in real estate, $3.7 million to acquire investments in direct financing receivables, $2.0 million paid to tenants as lease incentives, $1.0 million to fund construction in progress and $0.1 million paid for deposits on prospective real estate investments. These cash outflows were partially offset by $16.5 million of proceeds from sales of investments, net of disposition costs, and approximately $37,000 of principal collections on our direct financing lease receivables.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including real estate valuations prepared by independent valuation firms. We also consider information and other factors including market conditions, the industry that the tenant operates in, characteristics of the real estate, e.g., location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant's business. Additionally, we consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. We use the information obtained as a result of our pre-acquisition due\nRental revenue. Rental revenue increased by $38.1 million to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $15.3 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in rental revenue was primarily due to our acquisition of 212 properties during the year ended December 31, 2017, which provided $17.6 million of additional\nCash Flows for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016\nWe recognize compensation expense for equity-based compensation using the straight-line method based on the terms of the individual grant.\nWe are an internally managed real estate company that acquires, owns and manages primarily single-tenant properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to middle-market companies operating service-oriented or experience-based businesses. We have a diversified portfolio that focuses on properties leased to tenants in businesses such as restaurants (including quick service and casual and family dining), car washes, automotive services, medical services, convenience stores, entertainment, early childhood education and health and fitness. We acquire and lease freestanding, single-tenant commercial real estate facilities where a tenant services its customers and conducts activities that are essential to the generation of the tenant's sales and profits.\nOther revenue. Other revenue decreased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in lease termination income during the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset\n (3) Includes obligations to reimburse certain of our tenants for construction costs that they incur in connection with construction at our properties in exchange for contractually specified rent that generally increases proportionally with our funding. \nInterest. Interest expense increased by $7.6 million to $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to $5.6 million of additional interest expense from having notes issued under our Master Trust Funding Program on July 11, 2017 outstanding during the entire year ended December 31, 2018, $0.9 million of new interest expense relating to the Revolving Credit Facility that was entered into in June 2018 and $1.1 million of additional interest expense on our notes payable to related parties due to higher average borrowing balances during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn June 2018, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility, which is available to fund our short-term debt capital requirements, as further described below. Over time, we may access additional long-term debt capital with future debt issuances through our Master Trust Funding Program. Additionally, future sources of debt capital may include term borrowings from insurance companies, banks and other sources, single-asset mortgage financing and CMBS borrowings, and may offer us the opportunity to lower our cost of funding and further diversify our sources of debt capital. Over time, we may choose to issue preferred equity as a part of our overall funding strategy. As our outstanding debt matures, we may refinance it as it comes due or choose to repay it using cash and cash equivalents or borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Management believes that the cash generated by our operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018, the Revolving Credit Facility, and our access\nFunding Program permits substitution of real estate collateral from time to time, subject to certain conditions.\nWe calculate our net debt as our gross debt (defined as total debt plus net deferred financing costs on our secured borrowings) less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash deposits held for the benefit of lenders. We believe excluding cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash deposits held for the benefit of lenders from gross debt, all of which could be used to repay debt, provides an estimate of the net contractual amount of borrowed capital to be repaid, which we believe is a beneficial disclosure to investors and analysts.\n (1) Includes interest payments on outstanding indebtedness issued under the Master Trust Funding Program through the anticipated repayment dates. \nRevenues:\nASU 2016-02 was effective for us on January 1, 2019 and, in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, was adopted by us using the modified retrospective approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption. There was no impact to retained earnings at the time of adoption and, therefore, no cumulative-effect adjustment was recorded. At the time of adoption, both lessees and lessors are permitted to make an election to apply a package of practical expedients available for implementation under the standard. We applied this package of practical expedients and, as such, at the time of adoption did not reassess the classification of existing lease contracts, whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease or whether a portion of initial direct costs for existing leases should have been expensed. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged under ASU 2016-02; however, the standard requires that lessors expense, on an as-incurred basis, certain initial direct costs that are not incremental in obtaining a lease. Under the previous standards, certain of these costs were capitalizable. Although primarily a lessor, we are also a lessee under several ground lease arrangements and under our corporate office and office equipment leases. We have completed our inventory and evaluation of these leases and have calculated a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for the present value of the minimum lease payments; the amount recognized upon\nConcurrent with the completion of the IPO, we received an additional $125.0 million investment from an affiliate of Eldridge in the Concurrent Private Placement of 7,785,611 shares of our common stock and 1,142,960 OP Units. We contributed the net proceeds from the issuance of the 43,057,802 shares of common stock in our IPO (inclusive of the shares issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares) and the Concurrent Private Placement of common stock to Eldridge to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a like number of OP Units.\nConsistent with our intent to elect to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018, we believe that we were organized and operated in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner.\nThe following discussion includes the results of the Company's and the Predecessor's operations collectively for the periods presented.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to EBITDA and EBITDAre attributable to stockholders and members and non-controlling interests:\nOur short-term liquidity requirements also include the funding needs associated with seven of our properties where we have agreed to provide construction financing or reimburse the tenant for certain development, construction and renovation costs in exchange for contractually specified interest or rent that generally increases in proportion with our funding. As of December 31, 2018, we had agreed to finance or reimburse development, construction or renovation costs in an aggregate amount of $34.4 million and, as of the same date, we had funded $14.9 million of this commitment. We expect to fund the balance of such commitment by December 31, 2019. Additionally, as of February 22, 2019, we were under contract to acquire 20 properties with an aggregate purchase price of $40.1 million, subject to completion of our due diligence procedures and customary closing conditions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including our investment in potential future acquisitions, primarily from cash and cash equivalents, net cash from operating activities and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Series 2016-1 Notes may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the date that is 24 months prior to the anticipated repayment date in November 2021 without the payment of a make whole amount. Voluntary prepayments may be made before 24 months prior to the anticipated repayment date but will be subject to the payment of a make whole amount.\n\nThe Operating Partnership is the borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility, and we and each of the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that owns a direct or indirect interest in an eligible real property asset are guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur accounting policies are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially from our estimates. Estimates and assumptions include, among other things, subjective judgments regarding the fair values and useful lives of our properties for depreciation and lease classification purposes, the collectability of receivables and asset impairment analysis. Set forth below are the more critical accounting policies that require management judgment and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d) to amend the accounting for leases. The new standard requires lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases based on certain criteria and record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months, regardless of their classification. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to the previous guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The standard also eliminates current real estate-specific provisions and changes the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs, lease modifications and lease executory costs for all entities. Certain changes to the guidance pertaining to sale-leaseback transactions may impact us. For example, the inclusion of a purchase option in the lease associated with a sale-leaseback transaction will now result in the lessor accounting for such transaction as a financing arrangement.\nThe fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant\u201d value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on the fair value of the tangible assets. The fair value of in-place leases is determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases based on the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. We estimate the cost to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in-place leases, including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Factors we consider in this analysis include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses, and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which primarily range from six to 12 months. The fair value of above- or below-market leases is recorded based on the net present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and our estimate of the fair market lease rate for the corresponding in-place lease, measured over the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease including any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.\nWe seek to acquire real estate with a combination of debt and equity capital and with cash from operations that will not otherwise be distributed to our stockholders. Prior to the IPO, equity capital needed for our real estate investments had been provided to us by Eldridge, our primary institutional capital provider. Subsequent to the IPO, we added public equity capital to our initial private institutional equity capital to facilitate our growth. Additionally, we used the net proceeds from the IPO and the Concurrent Private Placement to repay promissory notes issued to an affiliate of Eldridge, which had been our primary source of short-term debt capital prior to the IPO. Historically, upon accumulating a sufficiently large and diverse pool of real estate, we generally refinanced this debt through the issuance of long-term, fixed-rate debt through our Master Trust Funding Program, as further described below.\nWe calculate EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. In 2017, NAREIT issued a white paper recommending that companies that report EBITDA also report EBITDAre. We compute EBITDAre in accordance with the definition adopted by NAREIT. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding gains (or losses) from the sales of depreciable property and real estate impairment losses. We present EBITDA and EBITDAre as they are measures commonly used in our industry and we believe that these measures are useful to investors and analysts because they provide important supplemental information concerning our operating performance, exclusive of certain non-cash items and other costs. We use EBITDA and EBITDAre as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-05, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets\u201d ( ASU 2017-05\u201d), using the modified retrospective transition method. As leasing is our primary activity, we determined that our sales of real estate, which are nonfinancial assets, are sold to noncustomers and fall within the scope of ASC 610-20. We recognize the full gain on the disposition of our real estate investments as we (i) have no controlling financial interest in the real estate and (ii) have no continuing interest or obligation with respect to the disposed real estate. We re-assessed and determined there were no open contracts or partial sales and, as such, the adoption of ASU 2017-05 (i) did not result in a cumulative adjustment as of January 1, 2018 and (ii) did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe periodically evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable, including accrued interest, by analyzing the underlying property-level economics and trends, collateral value and quality and other relevant factors in determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. A loan is determined to be impaired when, in management's judgment based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Specific allowances for loan losses are provided for impaired loans on an individual loan basis in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less disposition costs.\nConstruction in progress is not depreciated until the development has reached substantial completion.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe intend to elect to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018; accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided we distribute all of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, to our stockholders.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nIf a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of each intangible, including in-place lease values, is charged to depreciation and amortization expense, while above- and below-market lease adjustments are recorded within rental revenue in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.\nPrior to the completion of the IPO, we engaged in a number of formation transactions designed to facilitate the completion of the IPO (the Formation Transactions\u201d). Among other things, on June 20, 2018, EPRT LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware limited partnership, changed its name to Essential Properties, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d) and became the subsidiary through which we hold substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations. Prior to the completion of the Formation Transactions, EPRT LLC was a wholly owned subsidiary of EPRT Holdings (together with EPRT LLC, the Predecessor\u201d), and EPRT Holdings received 17,913,592 units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( OP Units\u201d) in connection with EPRT LLC's conversion into a Delaware limited partnership. Essential Properties OP G.P., LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, became the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership in connection with the completion of our IPO.\nto long-term debt capital, will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and allow us to acquire the real estate for which we currently have made commitments.\nstraight-line rent receivable balance is subsequently deemed to be uncollectible, such receivable amounts are written-off to the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nIf and when an investment in direct financing lease receivables is identified for impairment evaluation, we will apply the guidance in both the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 310, Receivables ( ASC 310\u201d) and ASC 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d). Under ASC 310, the lease receivable portion of the net investment in a direct financing lease receivable is evaluated for impairment when it becomes probable we, as the lessor, will be unable to collect all rental payments associated with our investment in the direct financing lease receivable. Under ASC 840, we review the estimated non-guaranteed residual value of a leased property at least annually. If the review results in a lower estimate than had been previously established, we determine whether the decline in estimated non-guaranteed residual value is other than temporary. If a decline is judged to be other than temporary, the accounting for the transaction is revised using the changed estimate and the resulting reduction in the net investment in direct financing lease receivables is recognized by us as a loss in the period in which the estimate is changed.\nIn 2018, we granted shares of restricted common stock to our directors, executive officers and other employees that vest over a multi-year period, subject to the recipient's continued service. In 2017, the Predecessor granted unit-based compensation awards to certain of its employees and managers, as well as non-employees, consisting of units that vest over a multi-year period, subject to the recipient's continued service. We account for the restricted common stock and unit-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires that such compensation be recognized in the financial statements based on their estimated grant-date fair value. The value of such awards is recognized as compensation expense in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service periods.\nDirect Financing Lease Receivables\nFrom the Predecessor's commencement of operations on March 30, 2016 through January 31, 2017, the Predecessor and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements were treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, and, accordingly, the Predecessor was not subject to entity-level tax. Therefore, until the Predecessor's issuance of Class A and Class C units on January 31, 2017, the Predecessor's net income flowed through to SCF Funding LLC, its initial sole member, for federal income tax purposes. Following the issuance of Class A and Class C units, the Predecessor's net income flowed through to Class A and Class C unitholders for federal income tax purposes. With regard to state income taxes, the Predecessor was a taxable entity only in certain states that tax all entities, including partnerships.\nAn event of default will occur if, among other things, the Master Trust Issuers fail to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due, materially default in compliance with the material covenants contained in the documents evidencing the Notes or the mortgages on the mortgaged property collateral or if a bankruptcy or other insolvency event occurs. Under the master trust indenture, we have a number of Master Trust Issuer covenants, including requirements to pay any taxes and other charges levied or imposed upon the Master Trust Issuers and to comply with specified insurance requirements. We are also required to ensure that all uses and operations on or of our properties comply in all material respects with\nInterest. Interest expense increased by $21.6 million to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.0 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to $11.8 million of additional interest expense from having $280.8 million of notes issued under our Master Trust Funding Program in December 2016 outstanding for a full year, $8.0 million of additional interest expense on debt issued to finance acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017 and $1.8 million of additional non-cash interest expense from the amortization of deferred financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we issued an additional $248.1 million of notes under our Master Trust Funding Program and had net borrowings of $230.0 million through short-term notes with related parties.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nThrough December 31, 2017, gains and losses on dispositions of real estate investments were recorded in accordance with ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment-Real Estate Sales, and include realized proceeds from real estate disposed of in the ordinary course of business, less their related net book value and less any costs incurred in association with the disposition.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the portion of our net income attributable to the holders of units in our Operating Partnership, which are accounted for as non-controlling interests. No such non-controlling interests existed during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAbsent a plan to issue additional long-term debt through the Master Trust Funding Program, we are not required to add assets to, or substitute collateral in, the existing collateral pool. We can voluntarily elect to substitute assets in the collateral pool, subject to meeting prescribed conditions that are designed to protect the collateral pool by requiring the substitute assets to be of equal or greater measure in attributes such as: the asset's fair value, monthly rent payments, remaining lease term and weighted average coverage ratios. In addition, we can sell underperforming assets and reinvest the proceeds in new properties. Any substitutions and sales are subject to an overall limitation of 35% of the collateral pool which is typically reset at each new issuance unless the substitution or sale is credit- or risk-based, in which case there are no limitations.\nNet Income per Share\nentity's right to receive expected residual returns. However, we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity, because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying amount of our loan receivable with this entity was $5.7 million, and our maximum exposure to loss in this entity is limited to the carrying amount of our investment. We had no liabilities associated with this investment as of December 31, 2018.\nCapitalized above-market lease values are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental revenue over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market lease values are accreted on a straight-line basis as an increase to rental revenue over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases including any below-market fixed rate renewal option periods.\nCash Flows\nNOI and Cash NOI are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and our NOI and Cash NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. You should not consider our NOI and Cash NOI as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP.\nWe intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that 90% of ordinary REIT taxable income\u201d (as determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gains) be distributed. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent that we meet the organizational and operational requirements and our distributions equal or exceed REIT taxable income. For the period subsequent to the effective date of our intended REIT election, we intend to meet the organizational and operational requirements and expect distributions to exceed net taxable income. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal income taxes. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to state and local income and franchise taxes, and to federal income and excise tax on our undistributed income. Franchise taxes and federal excise taxes on our undistributed income, if any, are included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of\nThe Notes require monthly payments of principal and interest. The payment of principal and interest on any Class B Notes is subordinate to the payment of principal and interest on any Class A Notes. The Series 2016-1 Notes mature in November 2046 and have a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.51% as of December 31, 2018. However, the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2016-1 Notes is November 2021, and if the notes are not repaid in full on or before such anticipated repayment date, additional interest will begin to accrue on the notes. The Series 2017-1 Notes mature in June 2047 and have a weighted average interest rate of 4.17% as of December 31, 2018. However, the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2017-1 Notes is June 2024, and if the notes are not repaid in full on or before such anticipated repayment date, additional interest will begin to accrue on the notes.\nOn June 25, 2018, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility with a group of lenders, which provides senior unsecured revolving credit in the maximum aggregate initial original principal amount of up to $300.0 million. Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA were the joint lead arrangers of the facility, with Barclays Bank PLC acting as administrative agent. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2018, we had $34.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $266.0 million of unused borrowing capacity.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1.3 billion of net investments in our investment portfolio, consisting of investments in 677 properties (inclusive of one undeveloped land parcel and 12 properties which secure our investments in mortgage loans receivable), with annualized base rent of $106.8 million. Substantially all of our cash from operations is generated by our investment portfolio.\nLease incentives are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the lease incentive is charged to rental revenue.\nClarifying the Definition of a Business, an acquisition does not qualify as a business when there is no substantive process acquired or substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets or the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay. Transaction costs related to acquisitions that are asset acquisitions are capitalized as part of the cost basis of the acquired assets, while transaction costs for acquisitions that are deemed to be acquisitions of a business are expensed as incurred. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life or improve the productive capacity of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement: Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d), which changes the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, adding and modifying certain disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2018-13 on our related disclosures.\nWe continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. If the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the accounts receivable and straight-line rent receivable balances are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts on the consolidated balance sheets or a direct write-off of the receivable is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The provision for doubtful accounts is included in property expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. If the accounts receivable balance or\nFFO and AFFO do not include all items of revenue and expense included in net income, nor do they represent cash generated from operating activities, and they are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nOther operating income:\nNotes issued under our Master Trust Funding Program are secured by a lien on all of the property owned by the Master Trust Issuers and the related leases. A substantial portion of our real estate investment portfolio serves as collateral for borrowings outstanding under our Master Trust Funding Program. As of December 31, 2018, we had pledged 347 properties, with a net investment amount of $609.2 million, under the Master Trust Funding Program. The agreement governing our Master Trust\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and Business\u201d sections, as well as the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018.\nInterest income on loans and direct financing receivables. Interest income on loans and direct financing receivables increased by $0.1 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $0.2 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December31, 2016. The increase in interest income on direct financing receivables was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations from our eight investments in direct financing receivables acquired during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016 (net of disposition or termination of two direct financing leases during the year ended December 31, 2017).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gain or loss from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets and real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO is used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales (which are dependent on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions).\n (1) Adjustment assumes all acquisitions and dispositions of real estate investments made during the three months ended December 31, 2018 had occurred on October 1, 2018. \n\nThe Series 2017-1 Notes may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the date that is 31 months prior to the anticipated repayment date in June 2024 without the payment of a make whole amount. Voluntary prepayments may be made before 31 months prior to the anticipated repayment date but will be subject to the payment of a make whole amount.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $4.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $12.0 million of restricted cash as compared to $7.3 million and $12.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and $1.8 million and $10.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016\nSubstantially all of our lease contracts (under which we are the lessor) are triple-net\u201d leases, which means that our tenants are responsible for making payments to third parties for operating expenses such as property taxes and insurance costs associated with the properties we lease to them. Under the previous lease accounting guidance, these payments were excluded from rental revenue. In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-20 Leases (Topic 842), Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors. This update requires us to exclude from variable lease payments, and therefore revenue and expense, costs paid by our tenants directly to third parties (a net presentation). Costs paid by us and reimbursed by our tenants will be included in variable lease payments (a gross presentation)\nRental revenue. Rental revenue increased by $41.6 million to $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in rental revenue was primarily due to our acquisition of properties during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which provided $19.0 million and $22.2 million of additional rental revenue between the comparison periods, net of a reduction in rental revenue due to sale of properties during the comparison periods, and an increase in the net accretion of above- and below- market lease intangibles to revenue of $0.3 million between the comparison periods.\nall applicable environmental laws. As of December 31, 2018, we were in material compliance with all such covenants.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017, 98.8% of our properties were occupied. We regularly review and analyze the operational and financial condition of our tenants and the industries in which they operate in order to identify underperforming properties that we may seek to dispose of in an effort to mitigate risks in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, exclusive of two vacant land parcels that we own, six of our properties, representing 1.2% of our portfolio, were vacant and not generating rent, compared to 11 vacant properties, representing 3.2% of our portfolio, as of December 31, 2016.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nContractual Obligations\nVariable Interest Entities\nProperty expenses. Property expenses increased by $1.0 million to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.5 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in property costs was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations and related property expenses for our vacant properties during the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by reduced property expenses due to a net four property decrease in our total number of vacant properties during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReal Estate Investments\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $4.5 million to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $4.3 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. This increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operations and increased costs required to support our larger real estate investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following discussion of changes in cash flows includes the results of the Company and the Predecessor collectively for the periods presented.\nWe defer rental revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. These amounts are presented within accrued liabilities and other payables on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe have concluded that an entity which we have provided a $5.7 million mortgage loan receivable is a VIE because the terms of the loan agreement limit the entity's ability to absorb expected losses or the\nOverview\ndiligence as part of our consideration of the accounting standard governing asset retirement obligations and, when necessary, will record an asset retirement obligation as part of the purchase price allocation.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility has a term of four years from the original closing date with an extension option of up to 12-months exercisable by us, subject to certain conditions, and initially bears interest at an annual rate of (i) applicable LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 1.45% and 2.15%; or (ii) the base rate (which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus an applicable margin of between 0.45% and 1.15%. The applicable LIBOR is the rate with a term equivalent to the interest period applicable to the relevant borrowing. The applicable margin is initially a spread set according to a leverage-based pricing grid. At our election, on and after receipt of an investment grade corporate credit rating from S&P or Moody's, the applicable margin will be a spread set according to our corporate credit ratings by S&P and/or Moody's. The Revolving Credit Facility is freely prepayable at any time and will be mandatorily prepayable if borrowings exceed the borrowing base or the facility limit. We may re-borrow amounts paid down, subject to customary borrowing conditions. We are required to pay revolving credit commitment fees throughout the term of the Revolving Credit Facility based upon our usage of the Revolving Credit Facility, at a rate which depends on our usage of the Revolving Credit Facility during the period before we receive an investment grade corporate credit rating from S&P or Moody's, and which rate shall be based on the corporate credit rating from S&P and/or Moody's after the time, if applicable, we receive such a rating. However, there can be no assurance that we will receive an investment grade corporate rating from S&P and/or Moody's. The Revolving Credit Facility provides an accordion feature to increase, subject to certain conditions, the maximum availability of the facility by up to an additional $200.0 million.\nSCF RC Funding I LLC, SCF RC Funding II LLC and SCF RC Funding III LLC (collectively, the Master Trust Issuers\u201d), all of which are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, have issued net-lease mortgage notes payable (the Notes\u201d) with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $515.1 million as of December 31, 2018. The Notes are secured by all assets owned by the Master Trust Issuers. We provide property management services with respect to the mortgaged properties and service the related leases pursuant to an amended and restated property management and servicing agreement, dated as of July 11, 2017, among the Master Trust Issuers, the Operating Partnership (as property manager and as special servicer), Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National Association (as back-up manager) and Citibank, N.A. (as indenture trustee).\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired properties accounted for as asset acquisitions to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on their relative fair values. Tangible assets may include land, site improvements and buildings. Intangible assets may include the value of in-place leases and above- and below-market leases and other identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics.\nBeginning in 2016, two series of Notes, each comprised of two classes, were issued under the program: (1) Notes originally issued by SCF RC Funding I LLC and SCF RC Funding II LLC (the Series 2016-1 Notes\u201d), with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $272.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and (2) Notes originally issued by SCF RC Funding I LLC, SCF RC Funding II LLC and SCF RC Funding III LLC (the Series 2017-1 Notes\u201d), with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $242.8 million as of December 31, 2018. The Notes are the joint obligations of all Master Trust Issuers.\nOther income and expenses:\nLoans Receivable\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $14.1 million to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $5.4 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations and related depreciation and amortization expense from properties acquired during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016, which added $8.6 million of additional\nWe incur various costs in the leasing and development of our properties. Amounts paid to tenants that incentivize them to extend or otherwise amend an existing lease or to sign a new lease agreement are capitalized to lease incentive on our consolidated balance sheets. Tenant improvements are capitalized to building and improvements within our consolidated balance sheets. Costs incurred which are directly related to properties under development, which include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs and real estate taxes and insurance, are capitalized during the period of development as construction in progress. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that benefited. Determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project has reached substantial completion and is available for occupancy and capitalization must cease, involves a degree of judgment. We do not engage in speculative real estate development. We do, however, opportunistically agree to reimburse certain of our tenants for development costs at our properties in exchange for contractually specified rent that generally increases proportionally with our funding.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our operating expenses, including principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, and the general and administrative expenses of servicing our portfolio and operating our business. Since our occupancy level is high and substantially all of our leases are triple-net, our tenants are generally responsible for the maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us. When a property becomes vacant through a tenant default or expiration of the lease term with no tenant renewal, we incur the property costs not paid by the tenant, as well as those property costs accruing during the time it takes to locate a substitute tenant. As of December 31, 2018, excluding one undeveloped land parcel, all of our property locations were occupied and subject to a lease. We expect to incur some property costs from time to time in periods during which properties that become vacant are being marketed for lease. In addition, we may recognize an expense for certain property costs, such as real estate taxes billed in arrears, if we believe the tenant is likely to vacate the property before making payment on those obligations. The amount of such property costs can vary quarter to quarter based on the timing of property vacancies and the level of underperforming properties; however, we do not anticipate that such costs will be significant to our operations. From time to time, we may also sell properties that no longer meet our long-term investment objectives.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 67.4% of our annualized base rent was attributable to master leases, where we have acquired multiple properties from a seller and leased them back to the seller under a master lease. Since properties are generally leased under a master lease on an all or none\u201d basis, the structure prevents a tenant from cherry picking\u201d locations, where it unilaterally gives up underperforming properties while maintaining its leasehold interest in well-performing properties.\nCertain of our real estate investment transactions are accounted for as direct financing leases. We record the direct financing lease receivables at their net investment, determined as the aggregate minimum lease payments and the estimated non-guaranteed residual value of the leased property less unearned income. The unearned income is recognized over the life of the related lease contracts so as to produce a constant rate of return on the net investment in the asset. Our investment in direct financing lease receivables is reduced over the applicable lease term to its non-guaranteed residual value by the portion of rent allocated to the direct financing lease receivables.\nDuring the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.5 million. Cash inflows related to a net income adjusted for non-cash items of $8.6 million (net income of $3.8 million adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, provision for impairment of real estate, gains on dispositions of investments, net, and straight-line rent receivable of $4.8 million) and a $2.4 million increase in accrued liabilities and other payables. These cash inflows were partially offset by a net increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.5 million.\nCertain properties in our investment portfolio are subject to leases that provide for contingent rent based on a percentage of the tenant's gross sales. For these leases, we recognize contingent rental revenue when the threshold upon which the contingent lease payment is based is actually reached.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nProvision for impairment of real estate. Impairment charges on real estate investments were $2.4 million and $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provision for impairment of real estate at nine of our real estate investments, compared to seven real estate investments during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016.\nInterest. Interest income increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average daily cash balances in our interest-bearing bank accounts during the year ended December 31, 2018 because of the funds raised through the IPO (inclusive of the shares issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares) and the Concurrent Private Placement of common stock to Eldridge.\nWe generally lease each of our properties to a single tenant on a triple-net, long-term basis, and we generate our cash from operations primarily through the monthly lease payments, or base rent, we receive from the tenants that occupy our properties. As of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of real estate investments at 677 properties (inclusive of one undeveloped land parcel and 12 properties which\nThe Revolving Credit Facility restricts our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders under certain circumstances. In particular, we are generally limited to paying cash distributions with respect to\nWe adjust EBITDAre for our most recently completed fiscal quarter based on an estimate calculated as if all acquisition and disposition activity that took place during the quarter had been made on the first day of the quarter ( Adjusted EBITDAre\u201d). We then annualize Adjusted EBITDAre by multiplying it by four ( Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre\u201d), which we believe provides a meaningful estimate of our current run rate for all properties owned as of the date of this report. You should not unduly rely on this measure as it is based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Our actual reported EBITDAre for future periods may be significantly less than our current Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre for a variety of reasons.\nsecure our investments in mortgage loans receivable) that was diversified by tenant, industry and geography, had annualized base rent of $106.8 million and was 100.0% occupied.\nProvision for impairment of real estate. Impairment charges on real estate investments were $4.5 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a provision for impairment of real estate at 20 and nine of our real estate investments. We strategically seek to identify non-performing properties that we may re-lease or dispose of in an effort to improve our returns and manage risk exposure. An increase in vacancy associated with our disposition or re-leasing strategies may trigger impairment charges when the expected future cash flows from the properties from sale or re-lease are less than their net book value.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $5.0 million to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in stock compensation expense of $1.6 million, directors' fees of $0.2 million, legal and accounting fees of $1.4 million, personnel costs of $1.2 million and other costs required to support our growing real estate portfolio.\nTo derive AFFO, we modify the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance, including straight-line rental revenue, non-cash interest expense, non-cash compensation expense, amortization of market lease-related intangibles, amortization of capitalized lease incentives, capitalized interest expense, transaction costs and other non-cash charges. Such items may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on operating cash flows or long-term operating performance. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by non-cash and certain other revenues and expenses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO and AFFO attributable to stockholders and members and non-controlling interests:\nWe compute net income per share pursuant to the guidance in the FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The guidance requires the classification of our unvested restricted common stock, which contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing net income per share. Diluted net income per share of common stock further considers the effect of potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The OP Units held by non-controlling interests represent potentially dilutive securities as the OP Units may be redeemed for cash or, at our election, exchanged for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nInterest income on loans and direct financing receivables. Interest income on loans and direct financing receivables increased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to our initial investments in loans receivable during 2018.\nFollowing the completion of the Formation Transactions, we concluded that the Operating Partnership is a VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary, as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Operating Partnership. Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are held by the Operating Partnership. The assets and liabilities of the Operating Partnership are consolidated and reported as assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nGains and Losses on Dispositions of Real Estate\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n\n\nCapitalized above-market ground lease values are accreted as a reduction of property expenses over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property expenses over the remaining terms of the respective leases and any expected below-market renewal option periods where renewal is considered probable.\nWe calculate NOI as total revenues less property expenses. NOI excludes all other items of expense and income included in the financial statements in calculating net income or loss. Cash NOI further excludes non-cash items included in total revenues and property expenses, such as straight-line rental revenue, amortization of capitalized lease incentives, amortization of market-lease related intangibles and other non-cash charges. We believe NOI and Cash NOI provide useful and relevant information because they reflect only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and present such items on an unlevered basis.\nThe following table reconciles total debt (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to net debt:\nIn May 2014, with subsequent updates in 2015, 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which establishes a principles-based approach for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. The standard does not apply to revenue recognition for lease contracts or to the interest income recognized from direct financing receivables, which together represent substantially all of our revenue. Such revenues are related to lease contracts with tenants, which currently fall within the scope of ASC Topic 840 and will fall within the scope of ASC Topic 842 upon the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 (see below). Our sales of real estate are within the scope of ASU 2017-05 (see above). We adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for transition. The adoption of this new standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2018 and did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $412.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to cash inflows of $464.2 million from the issuance of common stock in the IPO (inclusive of the shares issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares), $109.0 million from the Concurrent Private Placement of common stock, $16.0 million from the Concurrent Private Placement of OP Units, $154.0 million from the issuance of notes payable to related parties, $34.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and $50.0 million of capital contributions to the Predecessor. These cash inflows were partially offset by the payment of $5.5 million of IPO costs, $384.0 million of payments of principal on notes payable to related parties, $7.8 million of repayments of secured borrowing principal, payment of $3.1 million of deferred financing costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility and the payment of $14.1 million in dividends.\nAdditionally, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operation of our business. These commitments generally have terms of one-year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.\nExpenses:\nThe following table provides information with respect to our commitments as of December 31, 2018.\nadoption was less than 1% of total assets. For a portion of our ground lease arrangements, the sublessees, or our tenants, are responsible for making payment directly to the ground lessors. Prior to the new standard such amounts were presented on a net basis; however, upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 the expense related to the ground lease obligations, along with the related sublease revenues, will be presented on a gross basis in the consolidated statements of income. ASU 2016-02 also requires additional disclosures within the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $22.5 million. Cash inflows related to a net income adjusted for non-cash items of $20.7 million (net income of $6.3 million adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, provision for impairment of real estate, gains on dispositions of investments, net, straight-line rent receivable, equity-based compensation and allowance for doubtful accounts of $14.4 million) and a $4.1 million increase in accrued liabilities and other payables. These cash inflows were partially offset by a net increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.3 million.\nInterest. Interest income increased by approximately $46,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average daily cash balances in our interest-bearing bank accounts during the year ended December 31, 2017.\noperations and comprehensive income. Additionally, taxable income from our non-REIT activities managed through our taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal, state and local taxes.\ndepreciation and amortization expense, and $5.5 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense recorded on the 212 properties that we acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $280.5 million during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016 related to cash inflows of $288.6 million of capital contributions to the Predecessor and $7.5 million of proceeds from secured borrowings under our Master Trust Funding Program. These cash inflows were partially offset by $7.7 million of deferred financing costs, $7.5 million of equity distributions by the Predecessor and $0.3 million of repayments of secured borrowing principal.\nby having a full year of expense reimbursement income on two properties that were acquired in September 2017.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in such jurisdictions. We follow a two-step process to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Step one, recognition, occurs when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Step two, measurement, determines the amount of benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when we subsequently determine that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. The use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions is prohibited.\nAs of December 31, 2018, scheduled principal repayments on the Notes issued under the Master Trust Funding Program for 2019 are $8.0 million. We expect to meet these repayment requirements primarily through our net cash from operating activities.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d), which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees, with the result of aligning the guidance on share-based payments to nonemployees with that for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions, and eliminating the need to re-value awards to nonemployees at each balance sheet date. ASU 2018-07 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted for companies who have previously adopted ASU 2017-09. We early adopted ASU 2018-07 effective July 1, 2018 for accounting for our liability-classified non-employee awards that had not vested as of that date. No adjustment to our retained earnings was required as a result of the adoption of ASU 2018-07.\nOther operating income:\nIncome Taxes\nThe value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market lease intangibles, is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining periods of the respective leases.\nTenant improvements are depreciated over the non-cancellable term of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter.\nOur reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose the following non-GAAP financial measures: funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), EBITDA further adjusted to exclude gains (or losses) on sales of depreciable property and real estate impairment losses ( EBITDAre\u201d), net debt, net operating income ( NOI\u201d) and cash NOI ( Cash NOI\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs.\nResults of Operations\nInvestments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of investments in real estate reflects their purchase price or development cost. We evaluate each acquisition transaction to determine whether the acquired asset meets the definition of a business. Under Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805):\nThe following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to NOI and Cash NOI attributable to stockholders and members and non-controlling interests:\n (4) Includes $1.5 million of rental payments due under ground lease arrangements where our tenants are directly responsible for payment. \nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $464.4 million. The cash used in investing activities included $509.8 million to acquire investments in real estate, $7.7 million to fund construction in progress, $0.3 million paid to tenants as lease incentives, $0.3 million paid for deposits on prospective real estate investments and approximately $48,000 for capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by $53.6 million of proceeds from sales of investments, net of disposition costs, and $0.1 million of principal collections on our direct financing lease receivables.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional properties and repay indebtedness. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, net cash from operating activities, future financings, working capital, proceeds from select sales of our properties and other secured and unsecured borrowings (including potential issuances under the Master Trust Funding Program). However, at any point in time, there may be a number of factors that could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including unfavorable conditions in the overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base, borrowing restrictions imposed by our lenders, general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance, liquidity and market perceptions about us. The success of our business strategy will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to access these various capital sources.\nWe were organized on January 12, 2018 as a Maryland corporation and intend to qualify to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. On June 25, 2018, we completed our IPO of 32,500,000 shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-225215), filed with the SEC under the Securities Act. On July 24, 2018, we issued an additional 2,772,191 shares of common stock at the IPO price of $14.00 per share pursuant to the partial exercise of an option granted to the underwriters of our IPO. Net proceeds from the IPO and the issuance of shares to underwriters, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses, were $458.7 million. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol EPRT\u201d.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to depreciation on the properties and improvements we own and to amortization of the related lease intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $11.9 million to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to the inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense for properties acquired during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 which added $5.6 million and $8.0 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $1.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense on properties that we disposed during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain on dispositions of real estate, net. Gain on dispositions of real estate, net decreased by $1.3 million to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We disposed of 45 real estate properties during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 47 real estate properties during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016\nOther income and expenses:\nOther revenue. Other revenue increased by $0.7 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $0.1 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in other revenue was primarily due to the receipt of $0.7 million of lease termination fees from former tenants during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nOur rental revenue is primarily related to rent received from tenants. Rent from tenants is recorded in accordance with the terms of each lease on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable initial term of the lease from the later of the date of the commencement of the lease or the date of acquisition of the property subject to the lease. Rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant controls the space and continues through the term of the related lease. Because substantially all of the leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, we record a straight-line rent receivable and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis through the expiration of the non-cancellable term of the lease. We take into account whether the collectability of rents is reasonably assured in determining the amount of straight-line rent to record.", "item_7_text": "any period of four fiscal quarters in an amount not to exceed the greater of (i) 95% of adjusted funds from operations (as defined in the credit agreement), or (ii) the amount required for us to maintain our status as a REIT, and such cash distributions may be further limited during events of default. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants that, subject to exceptions, limits or restricts, among other things, our incurrence of indebtedness and liens, disposition of assets, transactions with affiliates, mergers and fundamental changes, modification of organizational documents, changes to fiscal periods, making of investments, negative pledge clauses and lines of business and REIT qualification.\nDescription of Certain Debt\nAs we grow our real estate portfolio, we intend to manage our long-term debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of our debt will mature in any single year in the future. As of December 31, 2018, our nearest significant debt maturity was $272.3 million of notes issued under the Master Trust Funding Program, which mature in November 2046 but require monthly principal and interest payments through October 2021, with a balloon principal payment of $259.5 million due in November 2021. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we had, as of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings of $34.0 million and $266.0 million of unused borrowing capacity.\nrental revenue between the comparison periods, contractual rent escalations and the inclusion of a full year of operations from properties acquired during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016, which contributed $20.5 million of additional rental revenue between the comparison periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $461.9 million. Our net cash used in investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions, the development of our construction in progress, investments in loans receivable and, to a limited extent, capital expenditures, offset by cash provided from the disposition of real estate and principal collections on our direct financing receivables. The cash used in investing activities included $488.4 million to acquire investments in real estate, $15.3 million to fund construction in progress, $14.9 million of investments in loans receivable, $1.7 million for capital expenditures subsequent to acquisition, $0.5 million paid to tenants as lease incentives and an increase of $1.7 million in deposits on prospective real estate investments. These cash outflows were partially offset by $60.4 million of proceeds from sales of investments, net of disposition costs, and $0.1 million of principal collections on our direct financing lease receivables.\n (2) As of December 31, 2018, balances on the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate of prime rate plus a leverage-based credit spread of 0.45%. We also pay a facility fee on the total unused commitment amount of 0.15%. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, balances on the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate of applicable LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 1.45% and 2.15%. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $45.9 million. Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the rental rates specified in our leases, the collectability of rent and the level of our operating expenses and other general and administrative costs. Cash inflows related to a net income adjusted for non-cash items of $48.3 million (net income of $20.6 million adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, provision for impairment of real estate, gains on dispositions of investments, net, straight-line rent receivable, equity-based compensation and allowance for doubtful accounts, of $27.7 million). These cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in accrued liabilities and other payables and an increase of $0.8 million in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nAn additional liquidity need is funding the distributions that are one of the requirements for qualification for taxation as a REIT. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our board of directors declared total cash distributions of $0.434 per share of common stock. Holders of OP Units are entitled to distributions equivalent to those paid by the Company to common stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid $14.1 million of distributions to common stockholders and OP Unit holders, and as of December 31, 2018, we recorded $13.2 million of distributions payable to common stockholders and OP Unit holders. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. As a result of this requirement, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our business needs to the same extent as other entities that are not REITs. If we do not have sufficient funds available to us from our operations to fund our business needs, we will need to find alternative ways to fund those needs. Such alternatives may include, among other things, selling properties (whether or not the sales price is optimal or otherwise meets our strategic long-term objectives), incurring additional indebtedness or issuing equity securities in public or private transactions. The availability and attractiveness of the terms of these potential sources of financing cannot be assured.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense increased by approximately $34,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. As we are organized and operate with the intention of qualifying as a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal taxation. However, the Operating Partnership is subject to taxation in certain state and local jurisdictions that impose income taxes on a partnership. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the continued growth of our real estate investment portfolio and our expansion into new jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation.\nGain on dispositions of real estate, net. Gain on dispositions of real estate, net increased by $5.9 million to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.9 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in gain on dispositions of real estate was primarily due to our disposition of 47 real estate properties during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to our disposition of 17 properties during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016.\nThe FASB provides guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity (a VIE\u201d). VIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. A VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that (i) has the power to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nSubstantially all of our leases provide for periodic contractual rent escalations. As of December 31, 2018, leases contributing 97.1% of our annualized base rent provided for increases in future annual base rent, generally ranging from 1% to 4% annually, with a weighted average annual escalation equal to 1.5% of base rent. As of December 31, 2018, leases contributing 91.9% of annualized base rent were triple-net, which means that our tenant is responsible for all operating expenses, such as maintenance, insurance, utility and tax expense, related to the leased property (including any increases in those costs that may occur as a result of inflation). Our remaining leases were double net,\u201d where the tenant is responsible for certain expenses, such as taxes and insurance, but we retain responsibility for other expenses, generally related to maintenance and structural component replacement that may be required on such leased properties in the future. Also, we incur property-level expenses associated with our vacant properties and we occasionally incur nominal property-level expenses that are not paid by our tenants, such as the costs of periodically making site inspections of our properties. Since our properties are predominantly single-tenant properties, which are generally subject to long-term leases, it is not necessary for us to perform any significant ongoing leasing activities on our properties. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted average remaining term of our leases was 14.2 years (based on annualized base rent), excluding renewal options that have not been exercised, with 3.1% of our annualized base rent attributable to leases expiring prior to January 1, 2023. Renewal options are exercisable at the option of our tenants upon expiration of their base lease term. Our leases providing for tenant renewal options generally provide for periodic contractual rent escalations during any renewed term that are similar to those applicable during the initial term of the lease.\n\nReal estate investments that are intended to be sold are designated as held for sale\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale. Real estate investments are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale. If the disposal, or intended disposal, of certain real estate investments represents a strategic shift that has had or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results, the operations of such real estate investments would be presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for all applicable periods.\nRevenues:\nExpenses:\nA significant portion of our cash flows are generated by the special purpose entities comprising our Master Trust Funding Program. For the year ended December 31, 2018, excess cash flow from the Master Trust Funding Program, after payment of debt service and servicing and trustee expenses, totaled $18.3 million on cash collections of $50.9 million, which represents a debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the program documents) of 1.53 to 1. If at any time the monthly debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the program documents) generated by the collateral pool is less than or equal to 1.25 to 1, excess cash flow from the Master Trust Funding Program entities will be deposited into a reserve account to be used for payments to be made on the Notes, to the extent there is a shortfall; if at any time the three month average debt service coverage ratio generated by the collateral pool is less than or equal to 1.15 to 1, excess cash flow from the Master Trust Funding Program entities will be applied to an early amortization of the Notes. If cash generated by our properties held in the Master Trust Funding Program is required to be held in a reserve account or applied to an early amortization of the Notes, it would reduce the amount of cash available to us and could limit or eliminate our ability to make distributions to our common stockholders.\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2017\nIf circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. Impairment assessments have a direct impact on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\n\nWe hold our loans receivable for long-term investment. Loans receivable are carried at amortized cost, including related unamortized discounts or premiums, if any. We recognize interest income on loans receivable using the effective-interest method applied on a loan-by-loan basis. Direct costs associated with originating loans are offset against any related fees received and the balance, along with any premium or discount, is deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the term of the related loan receivable using the effective-interest method.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $449.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to cash inflows of $543.0 million from the issuance of notes payable to related parties, $248.1 million of proceeds from secured borrowings under our Master Trust Funding Program and $83.7 million of capital contributions to the Predecessor. These cash inflows were partially offset by $313.0 million of payments of principal on notes payable to related parties, $101.2 million of equity distributions by the Predecessor, $5.6 million of repayments of secured borrowing principal and $5.6 million of deferred financing costs.\nWe are subject to financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility, including maintaining: a limitation on total consolidated leverage of not more than 60% of the total value of certain of our assets (including unencumbered cash and cash equivalents, the value of real property assets, mortgage notes receivable and up to $10 million of construction or redevelopment costs) ( Total Consolidated Assets\u201d) with a step up on two non-consecutive occasions to 65%, at our election, for two consecutive quarters each following a material acquisition; a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50x; a consolidated tangible net worth of at least 75% of our tangible net worth at the date of the facility plus 75% of future net equity proceeds; a consolidated secured leverage ratio of not more than 50% of our Total Consolidated Assets; a secured recourse debt ratio of not more than 10% of our Total Consolidated Assets; an unencumbered leverage ratio of not more than 60% of our consolidated unencumbered real property and mortgage notes receivable with a step up on two non-consecutive occasions to 65%, at our election, for two consecutive quarters each following a material acquisition; and an unencumbered interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75x.\nBy seeking to match the expected cash inflows from our long-term leases with the expected cash outflows for our long-term, fixed-rate debt, we seek to lock in,\u201d for as long as is economically feasible, the expected positive difference between our scheduled cash inflows on the leases and the cash outflows on our debt obligations. In this way, we seek to reduce the risk that increases in interest rates would adversely impact our results of operations. Although we are not required to maintain a particular leverage ratio and may not be able to do so, we generally intend to target, over time, a level of net debt (which includes recourse and non-recourse borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock less unrestricted cash and cash held for the benefit of lenders) that is less than six times our annualized adjusted EBITDAre.\nEBITDA and EBITDAre are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and our EBITDA and EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. You should not consider EBITDA and EBITDAre as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP.\nProperty expenses. Property expenses increased by $0.4 million to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to having a full year of reimbursable property expense on two properties that were acquired in September 2017. Our leases are generally triple-net and provide that the tenant is responsible for the payment of all property-level expenses, such as maintenance, insurance, utility and tax expense, related to the leased property. Therefore, we are generally not responsible for operating costs related to the properties, unless a property is not subject to a triple-net lease or is vacant. Barring any significant changes in occupancy or composition of triple net leases in our portfolio between the comparison periods, we expect property expenses to remain fairly consistent.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and 15 years for site improvements.\nThe following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre attributable to stockholders and members and non-controlling interests for the three months ended December 31, 2018:\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2018\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense increased by $0.1 million to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.1 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The Predecessor was subject to taxation in certain state and local jurisdictions that impose income taxes on a partnership. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the continued growth of our real estate investment portfolio and our expansion into new jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation.\nMaster Trust Funding Program\nNet cash used in investing activities during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016 was $279.1 million. The cash used in investing activities included $288.9 million to acquire investments in real estate, $3.7 million to acquire investments in direct financing receivables, $2.0 million paid to tenants as lease incentives, $1.0 million to fund construction in progress and $0.1 million paid for deposits on prospective real estate investments. These cash outflows were partially offset by $16.5 million of proceeds from sales of investments, net of disposition costs, and approximately $37,000 of principal collections on our direct financing lease receivables.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including real estate valuations prepared by independent valuation firms. We also consider information and other factors including market conditions, the industry that the tenant operates in, characteristics of the real estate, e.g., location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant's business. Additionally, we consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. We use the information obtained as a result of our pre-acquisition due\nRental revenue. Rental revenue increased by $38.1 million to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $15.3 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in rental revenue was primarily due to our acquisition of 212 properties during the year ended December 31, 2017, which provided $17.6 million of additional\nCash Flows for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016\nWe recognize compensation expense for equity-based compensation using the straight-line method based on the terms of the individual grant.\nWe are an internally managed real estate company that acquires, owns and manages primarily single-tenant properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to middle-market companies operating service-oriented or experience-based businesses. We have a diversified portfolio that focuses on properties leased to tenants in businesses such as restaurants (including quick service and casual and family dining), car washes, automotive services, medical services, convenience stores, entertainment, early childhood education and health and fitness. We acquire and lease freestanding, single-tenant commercial real estate facilities where a tenant services its customers and conducts activities that are essential to the generation of the tenant's sales and profits.\nOther revenue. Other revenue decreased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in lease termination income during the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset\n (3) Includes obligations to reimburse certain of our tenants for construction costs that they incur in connection with construction at our properties in exchange for contractually specified rent that generally increases proportionally with our funding. \nInterest. Interest expense increased by $7.6 million to $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to $5.6 million of additional interest expense from having notes issued under our Master Trust Funding Program on July 11, 2017 outstanding during the entire year ended December 31, 2018, $0.9 million of new interest expense relating to the Revolving Credit Facility that was entered into in June 2018 and $1.1 million of additional interest expense on our notes payable to related parties due to higher average borrowing balances during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn June 2018, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility, which is available to fund our short-term debt capital requirements, as further described below. Over time, we may access additional long-term debt capital with future debt issuances through our Master Trust Funding Program. Additionally, future sources of debt capital may include term borrowings from insurance companies, banks and other sources, single-asset mortgage financing and CMBS borrowings, and may offer us the opportunity to lower our cost of funding and further diversify our sources of debt capital. Over time, we may choose to issue preferred equity as a part of our overall funding strategy. As our outstanding debt matures, we may refinance it as it comes due or choose to repay it using cash and cash equivalents or borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Management believes that the cash generated by our operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018, the Revolving Credit Facility, and our access\nFunding Program permits substitution of real estate collateral from time to time, subject to certain conditions.\nWe calculate our net debt as our gross debt (defined as total debt plus net deferred financing costs on our secured borrowings) less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash deposits held for the benefit of lenders. We believe excluding cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash deposits held for the benefit of lenders from gross debt, all of which could be used to repay debt, provides an estimate of the net contractual amount of borrowed capital to be repaid, which we believe is a beneficial disclosure to investors and analysts.\n (1) Includes interest payments on outstanding indebtedness issued under the Master Trust Funding Program through the anticipated repayment dates. \nRevenues:\nASU 2016-02 was effective for us on January 1, 2019 and, in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, was adopted by us using the modified retrospective approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption. There was no impact to retained earnings at the time of adoption and, therefore, no cumulative-effect adjustment was recorded. At the time of adoption, both lessees and lessors are permitted to make an election to apply a package of practical expedients available for implementation under the standard. We applied this package of practical expedients and, as such, at the time of adoption did not reassess the classification of existing lease contracts, whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease or whether a portion of initial direct costs for existing leases should have been expensed. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged under ASU 2016-02; however, the standard requires that lessors expense, on an as-incurred basis, certain initial direct costs that are not incremental in obtaining a lease. Under the previous standards, certain of these costs were capitalizable. Although primarily a lessor, we are also a lessee under several ground lease arrangements and under our corporate office and office equipment leases. We have completed our inventory and evaluation of these leases and have calculated a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for the present value of the minimum lease payments; the amount recognized upon\nConcurrent with the completion of the IPO, we received an additional $125.0 million investment from an affiliate of Eldridge in the Concurrent Private Placement of 7,785,611 shares of our common stock and 1,142,960 OP Units. We contributed the net proceeds from the issuance of the 43,057,802 shares of common stock in our IPO (inclusive of the shares issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares) and the Concurrent Private Placement of common stock to Eldridge to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a like number of OP Units.\nConsistent with our intent to elect to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018, we believe that we were organized and operated in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner.\nThe following discussion includes the results of the Company's and the Predecessor's operations collectively for the periods presented.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to EBITDA and EBITDAre attributable to stockholders and members and non-controlling interests:\nOur short-term liquidity requirements also include the funding needs associated with seven of our properties where we have agreed to provide construction financing or reimburse the tenant for certain development, construction and renovation costs in exchange for contractually specified interest or rent that generally increases in proportion with our funding. As of December 31, 2018, we had agreed to finance or reimburse development, construction or renovation costs in an aggregate amount of $34.4 million and, as of the same date, we had funded $14.9 million of this commitment. We expect to fund the balance of such commitment by December 31, 2019. Additionally, as of February 22, 2019, we were under contract to acquire 20 properties with an aggregate purchase price of $40.1 million, subject to completion of our due diligence procedures and customary closing conditions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including our investment in potential future acquisitions, primarily from cash and cash equivalents, net cash from operating activities and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Series 2016-1 Notes may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the date that is 24 months prior to the anticipated repayment date in November 2021 without the payment of a make whole amount. Voluntary prepayments may be made before 24 months prior to the anticipated repayment date but will be subject to the payment of a make whole amount.\n\nThe Operating Partnership is the borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility, and we and each of the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that owns a direct or indirect interest in an eligible real property asset are guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur accounting policies are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially from our estimates. Estimates and assumptions include, among other things, subjective judgments regarding the fair values and useful lives of our properties for depreciation and lease classification purposes, the collectability of receivables and asset impairment analysis. Set forth below are the more critical accounting policies that require management judgment and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d) to amend the accounting for leases. The new standard requires lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases based on certain criteria and record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months, regardless of their classification. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to the previous guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The standard also eliminates current real estate-specific provisions and changes the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs, lease modifications and lease executory costs for all entities. Certain changes to the guidance pertaining to sale-leaseback transactions may impact us. For example, the inclusion of a purchase option in the lease associated with a sale-leaseback transaction will now result in the lessor accounting for such transaction as a financing arrangement.\nThe fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant\u201d value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on the fair value of the tangible assets. The fair value of in-place leases is determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases based on the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. We estimate the cost to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in-place leases, including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Factors we consider in this analysis include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses, and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which primarily range from six to 12 months. The fair value of above- or below-market leases is recorded based on the net present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and our estimate of the fair market lease rate for the corresponding in-place lease, measured over the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease including any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.\nWe seek to acquire real estate with a combination of debt and equity capital and with cash from operations that will not otherwise be distributed to our stockholders. Prior to the IPO, equity capital needed for our real estate investments had been provided to us by Eldridge, our primary institutional capital provider. Subsequent to the IPO, we added public equity capital to our initial private institutional equity capital to facilitate our growth. Additionally, we used the net proceeds from the IPO and the Concurrent Private Placement to repay promissory notes issued to an affiliate of Eldridge, which had been our primary source of short-term debt capital prior to the IPO. Historically, upon accumulating a sufficiently large and diverse pool of real estate, we generally refinanced this debt through the issuance of long-term, fixed-rate debt through our Master Trust Funding Program, as further described below.\nWe calculate EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. In 2017, NAREIT issued a white paper recommending that companies that report EBITDA also report EBITDAre. We compute EBITDAre in accordance with the definition adopted by NAREIT. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding gains (or losses) from the sales of depreciable property and real estate impairment losses. We present EBITDA and EBITDAre as they are measures commonly used in our industry and we believe that these measures are useful to investors and analysts because they provide important supplemental information concerning our operating performance, exclusive of certain non-cash items and other costs. We use EBITDA and EBITDAre as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-05, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets\u201d ( ASU 2017-05\u201d), using the modified retrospective transition method. As leasing is our primary activity, we determined that our sales of real estate, which are nonfinancial assets, are sold to noncustomers and fall within the scope of ASC 610-20. We recognize the full gain on the disposition of our real estate investments as we (i) have no controlling financial interest in the real estate and (ii) have no continuing interest or obligation with respect to the disposed real estate. We re-assessed and determined there were no open contracts or partial sales and, as such, the adoption of ASU 2017-05 (i) did not result in a cumulative adjustment as of January 1, 2018 and (ii) did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe periodically evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable, including accrued interest, by analyzing the underlying property-level economics and trends, collateral value and quality and other relevant factors in determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. A loan is determined to be impaired when, in management's judgment based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Specific allowances for loan losses are provided for impaired loans on an individual loan basis in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less disposition costs.\nConstruction in progress is not depreciated until the development has reached substantial completion.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe intend to elect to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018; accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided we distribute all of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, to our stockholders.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nIf a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of each intangible, including in-place lease values, is charged to depreciation and amortization expense, while above- and below-market lease adjustments are recorded within rental revenue in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.\nPrior to the completion of the IPO, we engaged in a number of formation transactions designed to facilitate the completion of the IPO (the Formation Transactions\u201d). Among other things, on June 20, 2018, EPRT LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware limited partnership, changed its name to Essential Properties, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d) and became the subsidiary through which we hold substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations. Prior to the completion of the Formation Transactions, EPRT LLC was a wholly owned subsidiary of EPRT Holdings (together with EPRT LLC, the Predecessor\u201d), and EPRT Holdings received 17,913,592 units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( OP Units\u201d) in connection with EPRT LLC's conversion into a Delaware limited partnership. Essential Properties OP G.P., LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, became the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership in connection with the completion of our IPO.\nto long-term debt capital, will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and allow us to acquire the real estate for which we currently have made commitments.\nstraight-line rent receivable balance is subsequently deemed to be uncollectible, such receivable amounts are written-off to the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nIf and when an investment in direct financing lease receivables is identified for impairment evaluation, we will apply the guidance in both the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 310, Receivables ( ASC 310\u201d) and ASC 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d). Under ASC 310, the lease receivable portion of the net investment in a direct financing lease receivable is evaluated for impairment when it becomes probable we, as the lessor, will be unable to collect all rental payments associated with our investment in the direct financing lease receivable. Under ASC 840, we review the estimated non-guaranteed residual value of a leased property at least annually. If the review results in a lower estimate than had been previously established, we determine whether the decline in estimated non-guaranteed residual value is other than temporary. If a decline is judged to be other than temporary, the accounting for the transaction is revised using the changed estimate and the resulting reduction in the net investment in direct financing lease receivables is recognized by us as a loss in the period in which the estimate is changed.\nIn 2018, we granted shares of restricted common stock to our directors, executive officers and other employees that vest over a multi-year period, subject to the recipient's continued service. In 2017, the Predecessor granted unit-based compensation awards to certain of its employees and managers, as well as non-employees, consisting of units that vest over a multi-year period, subject to the recipient's continued service. We account for the restricted common stock and unit-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires that such compensation be recognized in the financial statements based on their estimated grant-date fair value. The value of such awards is recognized as compensation expense in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service periods.\nDirect Financing Lease Receivables\nFrom the Predecessor's commencement of operations on March 30, 2016 through January 31, 2017, the Predecessor and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements were treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, and, accordingly, the Predecessor was not subject to entity-level tax. Therefore, until the Predecessor's issuance of Class A and Class C units on January 31, 2017, the Predecessor's net income flowed through to SCF Funding LLC, its initial sole member, for federal income tax purposes. Following the issuance of Class A and Class C units, the Predecessor's net income flowed through to Class A and Class C unitholders for federal income tax purposes. With regard to state income taxes, the Predecessor was a taxable entity only in certain states that tax all entities, including partnerships.\nAn event of default will occur if, among other things, the Master Trust Issuers fail to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due, materially default in compliance with the material covenants contained in the documents evidencing the Notes or the mortgages on the mortgaged property collateral or if a bankruptcy or other insolvency event occurs. Under the master trust indenture, we have a number of Master Trust Issuer covenants, including requirements to pay any taxes and other charges levied or imposed upon the Master Trust Issuers and to comply with specified insurance requirements. We are also required to ensure that all uses and operations on or of our properties comply in all material respects with\nInterest. Interest expense increased by $21.6 million to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.0 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to $11.8 million of additional interest expense from having $280.8 million of notes issued under our Master Trust Funding Program in December 2016 outstanding for a full year, $8.0 million of additional interest expense on debt issued to finance acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017 and $1.8 million of additional non-cash interest expense from the amortization of deferred financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we issued an additional $248.1 million of notes under our Master Trust Funding Program and had net borrowings of $230.0 million through short-term notes with related parties.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nThrough December 31, 2017, gains and losses on dispositions of real estate investments were recorded in accordance with ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment-Real Estate Sales, and include realized proceeds from real estate disposed of in the ordinary course of business, less their related net book value and less any costs incurred in association with the disposition.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the portion of our net income attributable to the holders of units in our Operating Partnership, which are accounted for as non-controlling interests. No such non-controlling interests existed during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAbsent a plan to issue additional long-term debt through the Master Trust Funding Program, we are not required to add assets to, or substitute collateral in, the existing collateral pool. We can voluntarily elect to substitute assets in the collateral pool, subject to meeting prescribed conditions that are designed to protect the collateral pool by requiring the substitute assets to be of equal or greater measure in attributes such as: the asset's fair value, monthly rent payments, remaining lease term and weighted average coverage ratios. In addition, we can sell underperforming assets and reinvest the proceeds in new properties. Any substitutions and sales are subject to an overall limitation of 35% of the collateral pool which is typically reset at each new issuance unless the substitution or sale is credit- or risk-based, in which case there are no limitations.\nNet Income per Share\nentity's right to receive expected residual returns. However, we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity, because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying amount of our loan receivable with this entity was $5.7 million, and our maximum exposure to loss in this entity is limited to the carrying amount of our investment. We had no liabilities associated with this investment as of December 31, 2018.\nCapitalized above-market lease values are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental revenue over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market lease values are accreted on a straight-line basis as an increase to rental revenue over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases including any below-market fixed rate renewal option periods.\nCash Flows\nNOI and Cash NOI are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and our NOI and Cash NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. You should not consider our NOI and Cash NOI as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP.\nWe intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that 90% of ordinary REIT taxable income\u201d (as determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gains) be distributed. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent that we meet the organizational and operational requirements and our distributions equal or exceed REIT taxable income. For the period subsequent to the effective date of our intended REIT election, we intend to meet the organizational and operational requirements and expect distributions to exceed net taxable income. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal income taxes. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to state and local income and franchise taxes, and to federal income and excise tax on our undistributed income. Franchise taxes and federal excise taxes on our undistributed income, if any, are included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of\nThe Notes require monthly payments of principal and interest. The payment of principal and interest on any Class B Notes is subordinate to the payment of principal and interest on any Class A Notes. The Series 2016-1 Notes mature in November 2046 and have a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.51% as of December 31, 2018. However, the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2016-1 Notes is November 2021, and if the notes are not repaid in full on or before such anticipated repayment date, additional interest will begin to accrue on the notes. The Series 2017-1 Notes mature in June 2047 and have a weighted average interest rate of 4.17% as of December 31, 2018. However, the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2017-1 Notes is June 2024, and if the notes are not repaid in full on or before such anticipated repayment date, additional interest will begin to accrue on the notes.\nOn June 25, 2018, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility with a group of lenders, which provides senior unsecured revolving credit in the maximum aggregate initial original principal amount of up to $300.0 million. Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA were the joint lead arrangers of the facility, with Barclays Bank PLC acting as administrative agent. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2018, we had $34.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $266.0 million of unused borrowing capacity.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1.3 billion of net investments in our investment portfolio, consisting of investments in 677 properties (inclusive of one undeveloped land parcel and 12 properties which secure our investments in mortgage loans receivable), with annualized base rent of $106.8 million. Substantially all of our cash from operations is generated by our investment portfolio.\nLease incentives are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the lease incentive is charged to rental revenue.\nClarifying the Definition of a Business, an acquisition does not qualify as a business when there is no substantive process acquired or substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets or the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay. Transaction costs related to acquisitions that are asset acquisitions are capitalized as part of the cost basis of the acquired assets, while transaction costs for acquisitions that are deemed to be acquisitions of a business are expensed as incurred. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life or improve the productive capacity of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement: Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d), which changes the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, adding and modifying certain disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2018-13 on our related disclosures.\nWe continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. If the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the accounts receivable and straight-line rent receivable balances are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts on the consolidated balance sheets or a direct write-off of the receivable is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The provision for doubtful accounts is included in property expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. If the accounts receivable balance or\nFFO and AFFO do not include all items of revenue and expense included in net income, nor do they represent cash generated from operating activities, and they are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nOther operating income:\nNotes issued under our Master Trust Funding Program are secured by a lien on all of the property owned by the Master Trust Issuers and the related leases. A substantial portion of our real estate investment portfolio serves as collateral for borrowings outstanding under our Master Trust Funding Program. As of December 31, 2018, we had pledged 347 properties, with a net investment amount of $609.2 million, under the Master Trust Funding Program. The agreement governing our Master Trust\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and Business\u201d sections, as well as the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018.\nInterest income on loans and direct financing receivables. Interest income on loans and direct financing receivables increased by $0.1 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $0.2 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December31, 2016. The increase in interest income on direct financing receivables was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations from our eight investments in direct financing receivables acquired during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016 (net of disposition or termination of two direct financing leases during the year ended December 31, 2017).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gain or loss from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets and real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO is used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales (which are dependent on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions).\n (1) Adjustment assumes all acquisitions and dispositions of real estate investments made during the three months ended December 31, 2018 had occurred on October 1, 2018. \n\nThe Series 2017-1 Notes may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the date that is 31 months prior to the anticipated repayment date in June 2024 without the payment of a make whole amount. Voluntary prepayments may be made before 31 months prior to the anticipated repayment date but will be subject to the payment of a make whole amount.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $4.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $12.0 million of restricted cash as compared to $7.3 million and $12.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and $1.8 million and $10.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016\nSubstantially all of our lease contracts (under which we are the lessor) are triple-net\u201d leases, which means that our tenants are responsible for making payments to third parties for operating expenses such as property taxes and insurance costs associated with the properties we lease to them. Under the previous lease accounting guidance, these payments were excluded from rental revenue. In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-20 Leases (Topic 842), Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors. This update requires us to exclude from variable lease payments, and therefore revenue and expense, costs paid by our tenants directly to third parties (a net presentation). Costs paid by us and reimbursed by our tenants will be included in variable lease payments (a gross presentation)\nRental revenue. Rental revenue increased by $41.6 million to $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in rental revenue was primarily due to our acquisition of properties during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which provided $19.0 million and $22.2 million of additional rental revenue between the comparison periods, net of a reduction in rental revenue due to sale of properties during the comparison periods, and an increase in the net accretion of above- and below- market lease intangibles to revenue of $0.3 million between the comparison periods.\nall applicable environmental laws. As of December 31, 2018, we were in material compliance with all such covenants.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017, 98.8% of our properties were occupied. We regularly review and analyze the operational and financial condition of our tenants and the industries in which they operate in order to identify underperforming properties that we may seek to dispose of in an effort to mitigate risks in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, exclusive of two vacant land parcels that we own, six of our properties, representing 1.2% of our portfolio, were vacant and not generating rent, compared to 11 vacant properties, representing 3.2% of our portfolio, as of December 31, 2016.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nContractual Obligations\nVariable Interest Entities\nProperty expenses. Property expenses increased by $1.0 million to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.5 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in property costs was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations and related property expenses for our vacant properties during the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by reduced property expenses due to a net four property decrease in our total number of vacant properties during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReal Estate Investments\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $4.5 million to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $4.3 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. This increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operations and increased costs required to support our larger real estate investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following discussion of changes in cash flows includes the results of the Company and the Predecessor collectively for the periods presented.\nWe defer rental revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. These amounts are presented within accrued liabilities and other payables on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe have concluded that an entity which we have provided a $5.7 million mortgage loan receivable is a VIE because the terms of the loan agreement limit the entity's ability to absorb expected losses or the\nOverview\ndiligence as part of our consideration of the accounting standard governing asset retirement obligations and, when necessary, will record an asset retirement obligation as part of the purchase price allocation.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility has a term of four years from the original closing date with an extension option of up to 12-months exercisable by us, subject to certain conditions, and initially bears interest at an annual rate of (i) applicable LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 1.45% and 2.15%; or (ii) the base rate (which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus an applicable margin of between 0.45% and 1.15%. The applicable LIBOR is the rate with a term equivalent to the interest period applicable to the relevant borrowing. The applicable margin is initially a spread set according to a leverage-based pricing grid. At our election, on and after receipt of an investment grade corporate credit rating from S&P or Moody's, the applicable margin will be a spread set according to our corporate credit ratings by S&P and/or Moody's. The Revolving Credit Facility is freely prepayable at any time and will be mandatorily prepayable if borrowings exceed the borrowing base or the facility limit. We may re-borrow amounts paid down, subject to customary borrowing conditions. We are required to pay revolving credit commitment fees throughout the term of the Revolving Credit Facility based upon our usage of the Revolving Credit Facility, at a rate which depends on our usage of the Revolving Credit Facility during the period before we receive an investment grade corporate credit rating from S&P or Moody's, and which rate shall be based on the corporate credit rating from S&P and/or Moody's after the time, if applicable, we receive such a rating. However, there can be no assurance that we will receive an investment grade corporate rating from S&P and/or Moody's. The Revolving Credit Facility provides an accordion feature to increase, subject to certain conditions, the maximum availability of the facility by up to an additional $200.0 million.\nSCF RC Funding I LLC, SCF RC Funding II LLC and SCF RC Funding III LLC (collectively, the Master Trust Issuers\u201d), all of which are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, have issued net-lease mortgage notes payable (the Notes\u201d) with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $515.1 million as of December 31, 2018. The Notes are secured by all assets owned by the Master Trust Issuers. We provide property management services with respect to the mortgaged properties and service the related leases pursuant to an amended and restated property management and servicing agreement, dated as of July 11, 2017, among the Master Trust Issuers, the Operating Partnership (as property manager and as special servicer), Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National Association (as back-up manager) and Citibank, N.A. (as indenture trustee).\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired properties accounted for as asset acquisitions to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on their relative fair values. Tangible assets may include land, site improvements and buildings. Intangible assets may include the value of in-place leases and above- and below-market leases and other identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics.\nBeginning in 2016, two series of Notes, each comprised of two classes, were issued under the program: (1) Notes originally issued by SCF RC Funding I LLC and SCF RC Funding II LLC (the Series 2016-1 Notes\u201d), with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $272.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and (2) Notes originally issued by SCF RC Funding I LLC, SCF RC Funding II LLC and SCF RC Funding III LLC (the Series 2017-1 Notes\u201d), with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $242.8 million as of December 31, 2018. The Notes are the joint obligations of all Master Trust Issuers.\nOther income and expenses:\nLoans Receivable\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $14.1 million to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $5.4 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations and related depreciation and amortization expense from properties acquired during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016, which added $8.6 million of additional\nWe incur various costs in the leasing and development of our properties. Amounts paid to tenants that incentivize them to extend or otherwise amend an existing lease or to sign a new lease agreement are capitalized to lease incentive on our consolidated balance sheets. Tenant improvements are capitalized to building and improvements within our consolidated balance sheets. Costs incurred which are directly related to properties under development, which include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs and real estate taxes and insurance, are capitalized during the period of development as construction in progress. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that benefited. Determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project has reached substantial completion and is available for occupancy and capitalization must cease, involves a degree of judgment. We do not engage in speculative real estate development. We do, however, opportunistically agree to reimburse certain of our tenants for development costs at our properties in exchange for contractually specified rent that generally increases proportionally with our funding.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our operating expenses, including principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, and the general and administrative expenses of servicing our portfolio and operating our business. Since our occupancy level is high and substantially all of our leases are triple-net, our tenants are generally responsible for the maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us. When a property becomes vacant through a tenant default or expiration of the lease term with no tenant renewal, we incur the property costs not paid by the tenant, as well as those property costs accruing during the time it takes to locate a substitute tenant. As of December 31, 2018, excluding one undeveloped land parcel, all of our property locations were occupied and subject to a lease. We expect to incur some property costs from time to time in periods during which properties that become vacant are being marketed for lease. In addition, we may recognize an expense for certain property costs, such as real estate taxes billed in arrears, if we believe the tenant is likely to vacate the property before making payment on those obligations. The amount of such property costs can vary quarter to quarter based on the timing of property vacancies and the level of underperforming properties; however, we do not anticipate that such costs will be significant to our operations. From time to time, we may also sell properties that no longer meet our long-term investment objectives.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 67.4% of our annualized base rent was attributable to master leases, where we have acquired multiple properties from a seller and leased them back to the seller under a master lease. Since properties are generally leased under a master lease on an all or none\u201d basis, the structure prevents a tenant from cherry picking\u201d locations, where it unilaterally gives up underperforming properties while maintaining its leasehold interest in well-performing properties.\nCertain of our real estate investment transactions are accounted for as direct financing leases. We record the direct financing lease receivables at their net investment, determined as the aggregate minimum lease payments and the estimated non-guaranteed residual value of the leased property less unearned income. The unearned income is recognized over the life of the related lease contracts so as to produce a constant rate of return on the net investment in the asset. Our investment in direct financing lease receivables is reduced over the applicable lease term to its non-guaranteed residual value by the portion of rent allocated to the direct financing lease receivables.\nDuring the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.5 million. Cash inflows related to a net income adjusted for non-cash items of $8.6 million (net income of $3.8 million adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, provision for impairment of real estate, gains on dispositions of investments, net, and straight-line rent receivable of $4.8 million) and a $2.4 million increase in accrued liabilities and other payables. These cash inflows were partially offset by a net increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.5 million.\nCertain properties in our investment portfolio are subject to leases that provide for contingent rent based on a percentage of the tenant's gross sales. For these leases, we recognize contingent rental revenue when the threshold upon which the contingent lease payment is based is actually reached.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nProvision for impairment of real estate. Impairment charges on real estate investments were $2.4 million and $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provision for impairment of real estate at nine of our real estate investments, compared to seven real estate investments during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016.\nInterest. Interest income increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average daily cash balances in our interest-bearing bank accounts during the year ended December 31, 2018 because of the funds raised through the IPO (inclusive of the shares issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares) and the Concurrent Private Placement of common stock to Eldridge.\nWe generally lease each of our properties to a single tenant on a triple-net, long-term basis, and we generate our cash from operations primarily through the monthly lease payments, or base rent, we receive from the tenants that occupy our properties. As of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of real estate investments at 677 properties (inclusive of one undeveloped land parcel and 12 properties which\nThe Revolving Credit Facility restricts our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders under certain circumstances. In particular, we are generally limited to paying cash distributions with respect to\nWe adjust EBITDAre for our most recently completed fiscal quarter based on an estimate calculated as if all acquisition and disposition activity that took place during the quarter had been made on the first day of the quarter ( Adjusted EBITDAre\u201d). We then annualize Adjusted EBITDAre by multiplying it by four ( Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre\u201d), which we believe provides a meaningful estimate of our current run rate for all properties owned as of the date of this report. You should not unduly rely on this measure as it is based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Our actual reported EBITDAre for future periods may be significantly less than our current Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre for a variety of reasons.\nsecure our investments in mortgage loans receivable) that was diversified by tenant, industry and geography, had annualized base rent of $106.8 million and was 100.0% occupied.\nProvision for impairment of real estate. Impairment charges on real estate investments were $4.5 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a provision for impairment of real estate at 20 and nine of our real estate investments. We strategically seek to identify non-performing properties that we may re-lease or dispose of in an effort to improve our returns and manage risk exposure. An increase in vacancy associated with our disposition or re-leasing strategies may trigger impairment charges when the expected future cash flows from the properties from sale or re-lease are less than their net book value.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $5.0 million to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in stock compensation expense of $1.6 million, directors' fees of $0.2 million, legal and accounting fees of $1.4 million, personnel costs of $1.2 million and other costs required to support our growing real estate portfolio.\nTo derive AFFO, we modify the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance, including straight-line rental revenue, non-cash interest expense, non-cash compensation expense, amortization of market lease-related intangibles, amortization of capitalized lease incentives, capitalized interest expense, transaction costs and other non-cash charges. Such items may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on operating cash flows or long-term operating performance. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by non-cash and certain other revenues and expenses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO and AFFO attributable to stockholders and members and non-controlling interests:\nWe compute net income per share pursuant to the guidance in the FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The guidance requires the classification of our unvested restricted common stock, which contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing net income per share. Diluted net income per share of common stock further considers the effect of potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The OP Units held by non-controlling interests represent potentially dilutive securities as the OP Units may be redeemed for cash or, at our election, exchanged for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nInterest income on loans and direct financing receivables. Interest income on loans and direct financing receivables increased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to our initial investments in loans receivable during 2018.\nFollowing the completion of the Formation Transactions, we concluded that the Operating Partnership is a VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary, as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Operating Partnership. Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are held by the Operating Partnership. The assets and liabilities of the Operating Partnership are consolidated and reported as assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nGains and Losses on Dispositions of Real Estate\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n\n\nCapitalized above-market ground lease values are accreted as a reduction of property expenses over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property expenses over the remaining terms of the respective leases and any expected below-market renewal option periods where renewal is considered probable.\nWe calculate NOI as total revenues less property expenses. NOI excludes all other items of expense and income included in the financial statements in calculating net income or loss. Cash NOI further excludes non-cash items included in total revenues and property expenses, such as straight-line rental revenue, amortization of capitalized lease incentives, amortization of market-lease related intangibles and other non-cash charges. We believe NOI and Cash NOI provide useful and relevant information because they reflect only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and present such items on an unlevered basis.\nThe following table reconciles total debt (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to net debt:\nIn May 2014, with subsequent updates in 2015, 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which establishes a principles-based approach for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. The standard does not apply to revenue recognition for lease contracts or to the interest income recognized from direct financing receivables, which together represent substantially all of our revenue. Such revenues are related to lease contracts with tenants, which currently fall within the scope of ASC Topic 840 and will fall within the scope of ASC Topic 842 upon the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 (see below). Our sales of real estate are within the scope of ASU 2017-05 (see above). We adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for transition. The adoption of this new standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2018 and did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $412.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to cash inflows of $464.2 million from the issuance of common stock in the IPO (inclusive of the shares issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares), $109.0 million from the Concurrent Private Placement of common stock, $16.0 million from the Concurrent Private Placement of OP Units, $154.0 million from the issuance of notes payable to related parties, $34.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and $50.0 million of capital contributions to the Predecessor. These cash inflows were partially offset by the payment of $5.5 million of IPO costs, $384.0 million of payments of principal on notes payable to related parties, $7.8 million of repayments of secured borrowing principal, payment of $3.1 million of deferred financing costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility and the payment of $14.1 million in dividends.\nAdditionally, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operation of our business. These commitments generally have terms of one-year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.\nExpenses:\nThe following table provides information with respect to our commitments as of December 31, 2018.\nadoption was less than 1% of total assets. For a portion of our ground lease arrangements, the sublessees, or our tenants, are responsible for making payment directly to the ground lessors. Prior to the new standard such amounts were presented on a net basis; however, upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 the expense related to the ground lease obligations, along with the related sublease revenues, will be presented on a gross basis in the consolidated statements of income. ASU 2016-02 also requires additional disclosures within the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $22.5 million. Cash inflows related to a net income adjusted for non-cash items of $20.7 million (net income of $6.3 million adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, provision for impairment of real estate, gains on dispositions of investments, net, straight-line rent receivable, equity-based compensation and allowance for doubtful accounts of $14.4 million) and a $4.1 million increase in accrued liabilities and other payables. These cash inflows were partially offset by a net increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.3 million.\nInterest. Interest income increased by approximately $46,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average daily cash balances in our interest-bearing bank accounts during the year ended December 31, 2017.\noperations and comprehensive income. Additionally, taxable income from our non-REIT activities managed through our taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal, state and local taxes.\ndepreciation and amortization expense, and $5.5 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense recorded on the 212 properties that we acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $280.5 million during the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016 related to cash inflows of $288.6 million of capital contributions to the Predecessor and $7.5 million of proceeds from secured borrowings under our Master Trust Funding Program. These cash inflows were partially offset by $7.7 million of deferred financing costs, $7.5 million of equity distributions by the Predecessor and $0.3 million of repayments of secured borrowing principal.\nby having a full year of expense reimbursement income on two properties that were acquired in September 2017.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in such jurisdictions. We follow a two-step process to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Step one, recognition, occurs when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Step two, measurement, determines the amount of benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when we subsequently determine that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. The use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions is prohibited.\nAs of December 31, 2018, scheduled principal repayments on the Notes issued under the Master Trust Funding Program for 2019 are $8.0 million. We expect to meet these repayment requirements primarily through our net cash from operating activities.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d), which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees, with the result of aligning the guidance on share-based payments to nonemployees with that for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions, and eliminating the need to re-value awards to nonemployees at each balance sheet date. ASU 2018-07 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted for companies who have previously adopted ASU 2017-09. We early adopted ASU 2018-07 effective July 1, 2018 for accounting for our liability-classified non-employee awards that had not vested as of that date. No adjustment to our retained earnings was required as a result of the adoption of ASU 2018-07.\nOther operating income:\nIncome Taxes\nThe value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market lease intangibles, is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining periods of the respective leases.\nTenant improvements are depreciated over the non-cancellable term of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter.\nOur reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose the following non-GAAP financial measures: funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), EBITDA further adjusted to exclude gains (or losses) on sales of depreciable property and real estate impairment losses ( EBITDAre\u201d), net debt, net operating income ( NOI\u201d) and cash NOI ( Cash NOI\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs.\nResults of Operations\nInvestments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of investments in real estate reflects their purchase price or development cost. We evaluate each acquisition transaction to determine whether the acquired asset meets the definition of a business. Under Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805):\nThe following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to NOI and Cash NOI attributable to stockholders and members and non-controlling interests:\n (4) Includes $1.5 million of rental payments due under ground lease arrangements where our tenants are directly responsible for payment. \nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $464.4 million. The cash used in investing activities included $509.8 million to acquire investments in real estate, $7.7 million to fund construction in progress, $0.3 million paid to tenants as lease incentives, $0.3 million paid for deposits on prospective real estate investments and approximately $48,000 for capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by $53.6 million of proceeds from sales of investments, net of disposition costs, and $0.1 million of principal collections on our direct financing lease receivables.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to acquire additional properties and repay indebtedness. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, net cash from operating activities, future financings, working capital, proceeds from select sales of our properties and other secured and unsecured borrowings (including potential issuances under the Master Trust Funding Program). However, at any point in time, there may be a number of factors that could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including unfavorable conditions in the overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base, borrowing restrictions imposed by our lenders, general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance, liquidity and market perceptions about us. The success of our business strategy will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to access these various capital sources.\nWe were organized on January 12, 2018 as a Maryland corporation and intend to qualify to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. On June 25, 2018, we completed our IPO of 32,500,000 shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-225215), filed with the SEC under the Securities Act. On July 24, 2018, we issued an additional 2,772,191 shares of common stock at the IPO price of $14.00 per share pursuant to the partial exercise of an option granted to the underwriters of our IPO. Net proceeds from the IPO and the issuance of shares to underwriters, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses, were $458.7 million. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol EPRT\u201d.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to depreciation on the properties and improvements we own and to amortization of the related lease intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $11.9 million to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to the inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense for properties acquired during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 which added $5.6 million and $8.0 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $1.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense on properties that we disposed during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain on dispositions of real estate, net. Gain on dispositions of real estate, net decreased by $1.3 million to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We disposed of 45 real estate properties during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 47 real estate properties during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016\nOther income and expenses:\nOther revenue. Other revenue increased by $0.7 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $0.1 million for the period from March 30, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. The increase in other revenue was primarily due to the receipt of $0.7 million of lease termination fees from former tenants during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nOur rental revenue is primarily related to rent received from tenants. Rent from tenants is recorded in accordance with the terms of each lease on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable initial term of the lease from the later of the date of the commencement of the lease or the date of acquisition of the property subject to the lease. Rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant controls the space and continues through the term of the related lease. Because substantially all of the leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, we record a straight-line rent receivable and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis through the expiration of the non-cancellable term of the lease. We take into account whether the collectability of rents is reasonably assured in determining the amount of straight-line rent to record.", "item_7_tables": "Table 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

net leased properties. Rental revenue increased significantly in 2017 and 2018 compared to 2016 due to acquisitions of new properties.\n\n- Net income also increased in 2017 and 2018 compared to 2016. The increases were driven by higher rental revenue from property acquisitions, partially offset by higher interest expense and depreciation/amortization. \n\n- The company has been acquiring new properties and funding them through a combination of debt and equity. Significant sources of debt financing include a Master Trust Funding Program and a Revolving Credit Facility. Equity financing came from an IPO in 2018.\n\n- Cash from operations is used to fund acquisitions, development projects, capital expenditures, and distributions to shareholders. Cash from financing activities relates to raising debt and equity capital. Cash used in investing activities goes toward acquiring and developing real estate assets.\n\n- The company intends to qualify as a REIT starting in 2018. As a REIT, it expects to pay distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of taxable income.\n\n- Key performance metrics discussed include NOI, EBITDA, EBITDAre, FFO and AFFO. These are non-GAAP metrics used to evaluate the company's operating performance.\n\nIn summary, the report discusses the company's financial performance, sources of financing, use of cash flows, intention to operate as a REIT, and key operating metrics. The main focus is the growth in rental revenue and real estate investments funded through debt and equity financing."}
