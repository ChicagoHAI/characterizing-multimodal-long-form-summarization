Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nIn assessing our results of operations in a given period, one of the primary factors we consider is the level of snowfall experienced within the prior snow season. We typically compare the snowfall level in a given period both to the snowfall level in the prior season and to those snowfall levels we consider to be average. References to average snowfall\u201d levels below refer to the aggregate average inches of snowfall recorded in 66 cities in 26 snow-belt states in the United States during the annual snow season, from October 1 through March 31, from 1980 to 2015. During this period, snowfall averaged 3,062 inches, with the low in such period being 1,794 inches and the high being 4,502 inches.\nDuring the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2015, snowfall was 3,592 inches, which was 17.3% higher than average. Meanwhile, during the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2014, we experienced snowfall that was 42.1% higher than average. During the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2013, we experienced snowfall that was 6.9% higher than average. We believe the above average snowfall in the three consecutive years ending December 31, 2013, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 was the largest driver that positively impacted our business in 2015. Additionally, we believe other factors had a positive impact as well. These additional factors included a record number of new products launched in 2015, positively trending light truck sales in 2015 and the successful integration of Henderson.\nSales of parts and accessories for 2015 and 2014 were $51.0 million and $49.3 million, respectively, or approximately 74% and 68% higher than annual parts and accessories sales over the preceding ten years, respectively. Sales of equipment unit sales for 2015 and 2014 were $349.4 million and $254.2 million, respectively. In 2015, equipment unit sales increased 37.4%. We believe that the increase of both parts and accessories sales and equipment unit sales in 2015 as compared to the prior calendar year is a direct result of the three consecutive years of above average snowfall noted above. Meanwhile, we believe that pent up demand due to deferred new equipment purchases started to release in the year ended December 31, 2014 in the marketplace, continued to be released in the year ended December 31, 2015 and could continue to be released in or following another year of average or better snowfall that is accompanied by stronger macro-economic conditions.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the consolidated statements of income of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the table below and throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d consolidated statements of income data for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet Sales. Net sales were $400.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $303.5 million in 2014, an increase of $96.9 million, or 31.9%. This increase was primarily attributable to $96.1 million in sales at Henderson, which was acquired on December 31, 2014. Due primarily to sales of snow and ice control equipment at Henderson, overall sales of snow and ice control equipment for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 37.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Due primarily to the sales of parts and accessories at Henderson, overall parts and accessories sales increased by 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Sales of non-Henderson products also slightly increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in sales of non-Henderson products was due to a record number of new product releases which commenced shipping in the third quarter of 2015. Additionally contributing to the increase was the impact of three consecutive years of above average snowfall as discussed above.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales was $267.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $187.2 million in 2014, an increase of $80.3 million, or 42.8%. This increase was driven primarily by increased volume of products sold. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 61.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 66.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven by $77.2 million in cost attributable to the $96.1 million in sales at Henderson and costs associated with the non-Henderson new products as discussed above under -Net Sales\u201d. The increases in cost of sales as a percentage of sales were primarily due to higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales for Henderson products. In addition, the cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes the recognized expense of a $2.0 million fair value purchase accounting write up of inventory that was sold during the period. As a percentage of cost of sales, fixed and variable costs were approximately 16% and 84%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to approximately 14% and 86%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $132.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $116.3 million in 2014, an increase of $16.6 million, or 14.3%, due to the increase in net sales volume described above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased from 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 33.2% for the corresponding period in 2015, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.5 million, or 25.9%. The increase compared to year ended December 31, 2014 was mostly due to expenses related to ongoing operations at Henderson of $10.5 million. Intangible amortization expense increased $1.6 million due to additional intangible assets created as a result of the Henderson acquisition. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, decreased from 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 13.8% for the corresponding period in 2015 due to sales leverage.\nImpairment of Assets Held for Sale. On February 26, 2014, we entered into an agreement for the sale of land and a building located in Johnson City, Tennessee at an amount approximating the carrying amount of the assets. We closed on the sale of the Johnson City assets on April 30, 2014 with a sales price of $1.1 million and closing costs of $0.1 million. Consequently, we incurred a $0.1 million loss recognized on the disposal of assets held for sale in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.1 million in the corresponding period in 2014. Interest expense increased due to the additional borrowings resulting from the modifications made to the Company's existing term loan facility in connection with the financing of the Henderson acquisition.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, we did not refinance any of our debt and therefore did not incur a loss on extinguishment. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2014 was entirely driven by our amendment to our term loan facility resulting in a significant modification of our debt for a portion of our creditors which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of $0.7 million, write off of unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million and the expensing of certain fees of $0.6 million.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2015 was 33.3% compared to 35.6% for 2014. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 is lower than 2014 due to the relief of valuation allowances in several states resulting from consecutive years of taxable income in those states.\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $44.2 million compared to net income of $40.0 million for the corresponding period in 2014, an increase of $4.2 million. This increase was driven by the factors described above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nNet Sales. Net sales were $303.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $194.3 million in 2013, an increase of $109.2 million, or 56.2%. This increase was driven by increases of $89.8 million in sales of snow and ice control equipment and $19.4 million in parts and accessories sales. The increase in sales of snow and ice control equipment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in sales volume of snow and ice control equipment of $78.8 million, or 47.9%, as compared to the prior year, and by price increases that we implemented beginning in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 and an additional price increase that was effective in the third and fourth quarters of 2014. The increase in sales volume was largely a result of the above average snowfall in the markets we serve during the snow season ended March 31, 2014. Net sales of parts and accessories increased in the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 by 65.0%, from $29.9 million to $49.3 million. Net sales of parts and accessories remained comparatively high in 2014, above the preceding ten-year average by approximately 89%. As discussed above, the higher sales of parts and accessories was due in large part to the above average amounts of snowfall in the markets that our products are sold. Sales related to TrynEx products of $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased to $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 which also contributed to the increase in net sales for the period. Increase in TrynEx products was the result of both a full year of sales in 2014 as compared to eight months in 2013 due to the timing of our acquisition and due to above average snowfall in the markets we serve.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales was $187.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $128.7 million in 2013, an increase of $58.5 million, or 45.5%. This increase was driven primarily by increased volume of products sold. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from 66.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 61.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of higher volumes to absorb fixed spending in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally, in 2013, inflationary commodity experience was slightly favorable, while commodity costs in 2014 were slightly unfavorable. As a percentage of cost of sales, fixed and variable costs were approximately 14% and 86%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to approximately 18% and 82%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $116.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $65.7 million in 2013, an increase of $50.7 million, or 77.2%, due to the increase in net sales volume described above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 33.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 38.3% for the corresponding period in 2014, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $6.5 million, or 17.5%, primarily driven by higher incentive based compensation of $3.3 million and incremental sales and marketing expenses of $2.6 million, due to better operating results. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, decreased from 19.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 14.5% for the corresponding period in 2014 due to sales leverage.\nImpairment of Assets Held for Sale. We recorded assets held for sale on our balance sheet in conjunction with the closure of the Johnson City, Tennessee location in 2010. The land and building had been held for sale since the closure. In an effort to stimulate sales activity, we lowered the listed sale price which caused us to reassess the fair value of the assets held for sale. Consequently, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. On February 26, 2014, we entered into an agreement for the sale of the land and building at an amount approximating the carrying amount. We closed on the sale of the Johnson City assets on April 30, 2014 with a sales price of $1.1 million and closing costs of $0.1 million. Consequently, we incurred a $0.1 million loss recognized on the disposal of assets held for sale in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $8.3 million in the corresponding period in 2013.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to zero in the corresponding period in 2013. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2014 was entirely driven by our amendment to our term loan facility resulting in a significant modification of our debt for a portion of our creditors which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of $0.7 million, write off of unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million and the expensing of certain fees of $0.6 million.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2014 was 35.6% compared to 38.8% for 2013. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 is lower than 2014 due to a greater domestic manufacturing deduction in 2014 driven by better operating results..\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $40.0 million compared to net income of $11.6 million for the corresponding period in 2013, an increase of $28.4 million. This increase was driven by the factors described above.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nThese non-GAAP measures include:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFree cash flow; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese non-GAAP disclosures should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $56.5 million in 2015 as compared to $53.7 in 2014. Free cash flow (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $46.5 million compared to $48.5 million in 2014, a decrease in free cash flow of $2.0 million, or 4.1%. The decrease in free cash flow is primarily a result of an increase in capital expenditures of $4.8 million due to some facility improvements and investments in equipment, slightly offset by $2.8 million more cash provided by operating activities, as discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources. In 2015, there were higher capital expenditures due to some facility improvements and investments in equipment.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations. We believe that free cash flow provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations.\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,248 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n53,747 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n56,465 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(2,775) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(5,254) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(10,009) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,473 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n48,493 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,456 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for certain charges consisting of unrelated legal and consulting fees, as well as management fees paid by us to affiliates of our former principal stockholders, stock based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment on assets held for sale, certain purchase accounting expenses and offering costs. We use, and we believe our investors benefit from the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with additional tools to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our consolidated financial statements in evaluating our operating performance as compared to that of other companies, because it allows them to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Our management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with our senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\u201d that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. As a result, you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax obligations whether current or deferred.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $96.5 million compared to $87.9 million in 2014, an increase of $8.6 million, or 9.8%.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that other professionals, applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to pension obligations, recovery of accounts receivable, impairment assessment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as estimates used in the determination of the lower of cost or market value of inventory and liabilities related to taxation and product warranty.\nWe believe the following are the critical accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDefined Benefit Pension Obligation\nAs discussed in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income of our pension plans are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 715-30, Defined Benefit Plans-Pension, and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance. Actuarial valuations for 2015 used a discount rate of 4.0% and 3.9% for our hourly and salary pension plans, respectively, and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.25%. Meanwhile, actuarial valuations for 2014 used a discount rate of 4.9% and 4.8% for our hourly and salary pension plans, respectively, and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.25%. Our discount rate reflects the expected future cash flow based upon our funding valuation assumptions and participant data at the beginning of the plan year. The expected future cash flow was discounted by the Principal Financial Group's yield curve for the month preceding the 2015 year end.\nIn estimating the expected return on plan assets, we analyze historical and expected returns for multiple asset classes. The overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term inflation component, the risk-free real rate of return, and the associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was then developed based upon those overall rates and the target asset allocation of the plan. Changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans, shareholders' equity and related expense. We cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and, therefore, cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant. The funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets. The projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by our employees' service adjusted for future wage increases. At December 31, 2015, our pension obligation funded status was $10.8 million underfunded.\nOur funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations. We contributed approximately $1.8 million to our pension plans in 2015 and expect to make approximately $1.0 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2016. See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our pension plans.\nRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe recognize revenues upon shipment to the customer, which is when risk of loss passes and all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the price is fixed or determinable; (3) collectability is reasonably assured; and (4) the product has been shipped and we have no further obligations. Customers have no right of return privileges. Historically, product returns have not been material and are permitted on an exception basis only.\nWe offer a variety of discounts and sales incentives to our distributors. The estimated liability for sales discounts and allowances is recorded at the time of sale as a reduction of net sales. The liability is estimated based on the costs of the program, the planned duration of the program and historical experience.\nWe carry our accounts receivable at their face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific distributor circumstances and credit conditions taking into account the history of write-offs and collections. A receivable is considered past due if payment has not been received within the period agreed upon in the invoice. Accounts receivable are written off after all collection efforts have been exhausted. We take a security interest in the inventory as collateral for the receivable but often do not have a priority security interest. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying value of such assets to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment provision is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value of the asset, less costs of disposition. Our management considers such factors as current results, trends and future prospects, current market value, and other economic and regulatory factors in performing these analyses. We determined that no long-lived assets were impaired as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived trade names and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred. Conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset. The analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two-step process. The first step is the estimation of fair value of the applicable reporting unit. We have determined we have two reporting units, and all significant decisions are made on a companywide basis by our chief operating decision maker. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated by using an income and market approach. The estimated fair value is compared with our aggregate carrying value. If our fair value is greater than the carrying amount, there is no impairment. If our carrying amount is greater than the fair value, then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment, if any.\nThe second step calculates the implied fair value of the goodwill, which is compared to its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by valuing all of the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit at the hypothetical fair value, assuming the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the entire reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. Annual impairment tests conducted by us on December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 resulted in no adjustment to the carrying value of our indefinite- lived intangibles and goodwill.\nOur goodwill and trade name balances could be impaired in future periods. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors include:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na prolonged global economic crisis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na significant decrease in the demand for our products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nan adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsuccessful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out basis. We periodically review our inventory for slow-moving, damaged and discontinued items and provide reserves to reduce such items identified to their recoverable amounts.\nIncome Taxes\nOur estimate of income taxes payable, deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws, the difference between tax and financial reporting bases and liabilities, estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions, and current accounting standards. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known.\nWe have generated significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences as well as state net operating loss carryforwards. In assessing the ability to realize these deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, excluding those relating to indefinite lived intangible assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result of this analysis, we have recorded a valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets.\nAccruals for uncertain tax positions, if any, are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC 740-Income Taxes. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our accounting for income taxes.\nWarranty Cost Recognition\nWe accrue for estimated warranty costs as sales are recognized and periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amount as necessary. Our warranties generally provide, with respect to our snow and ice control equipment, that all material and workmanship will be free from defect for a period of two years after the date of purchase by the end-user, and with respect to our parts and accessories purchased separately, that such parts and accessories will be free from defect for a period of one year after the date of purchase by the end-user. Certain snowplows only provide for a one year warranty. We determine the amount of the estimated warranty costs (and our corresponding warranty reserve) based on our prior five years of warranty history utilizing a formula driven by historical warranty expense and applying management's judgment. We adjust our historical warranty costs to take into account unique factors such as the introduction of new products into the marketplace that do not provide a historical warranty record to assess.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of cash have been and we expect will continue to be cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facilities.\nOur primary uses of cash are to provide working capital, meet debt service requirements, finance capital expenditures, pay dividends under our dividend policy and support our growth, including through potential acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. For a description of the seasonality of our working capital rates see -Seasonality and Year-To-Year Variability.\u201d\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy that reflects an intention to distribute to our stockholders a regular quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of these dividends to holders of our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including our financial condition and earnings, legal requirements, taxes and other factors our Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. The terms of our indebtedness may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock under certain circumstances. As a result of this dividend policy, we may not have significant cash available to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities, including acquisitions. Our Board of Directors may, however, amend, revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had liquidity comprised of approximately $36.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability of approximately $99.4 million under our revolving credit facility. Borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility is governed by a borrowing base, the calculation of which includes cash on hand. Accordingly, use of cash on hand may also result in a reduction in the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Furthermore, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain at least $15.0 million of borrowing availability.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to a $13.3 million\nincrease in net income adjusted for reconciling items slightly offset by a $10.5 million in unfavorable working capital changes. Negatively impacting cash flow was a $6.8 million increase in accounts receivable and a $4.9 million increase in refundable income taxes paid.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $69.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This decrease was due to the $86.7 million in cash outflow in 2014 for the Henderson acquisition as compared to $11.8 million in additional outflows 2015 to complete the Henderson acquisition. Slightly offsetting this decrease, cash used in investing increased as a result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2015 as compared to 2014 by $4.8 million due to facility remodels and large expenditures related to equipment.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $63.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was largely due to a $77.5 million net increase in 2014 resulting from borrowing and payments of long term debt. The net increase in 2014 was a result of the Company amending and restating its senior credit facility to fund the Henderson acquisition, which included borrowings of long term debt of $188.1 million, partially offset by repayment of existing debt of $111.8 million. In 2015, we had no similar increase and made $1.9 million in repayments of long term debt. In conjunction with amending the Company's senior credit facility, $2.1 million in financing costs were paid in 2014. We also paid dividends of $19.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to dividends paid of $20.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.

Also, negatively impacting cash flow was an increase in inventory balances of $4.0 million, net of acquisitions. Offsetting this negative impact was an increase in accrued expenses by $6.6 million, driven primarily by increased accrued incentives and warranty reserves.

On December 31, 2014, in conjunction with the acquisition of Henderson, we amended and restated our senior credit facilities to, among other things, (i) increase the term loan facility by $65.0 million and (ii) increase the borrowing ability under the revolving credit agreement by $20.0 million. We made these changes to among other things, fund a portion of the Henderson acquisition. Following these changes, as of December 31, 2014, our senior credit facilities consisted of a $190.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility with a group of banks, of which $10.0 million will be available in the form of letters of credit and $5.0 million will be available for the issuance of short-term swingline loans.\nPrior to the December 31, 2014 changes to our senior credit facilities, the interest on the $125.0 million term loan facility was (at our option) (i) 3.25% per annum plus the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) 1.00% plus the greater of (1) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the statutory reserve rate and (2) 1.50% or (ii) 4.25% per annum plus the greater of (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate and (b) 1.50%. Under the revolving credit facility prior to December 31, 2014, we had the option to select whether borrowings would bear interest at either (i) 1.75% per annum plus the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate or (ii) 0.75% per annum plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 1%.\nFollowing the December 31, 2014 changes to the senior credit facilities described above, the new term loan under the Term Loan Credit Agreement generally bears interest at (at our election) either (i) 3.25% per annum plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) 1.00% plus the greater of (1) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) and (2) 1.00% or (ii) 4.25% per annum plus the greater of (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate and (b) 1.00%. The Term Loan Credit Agreement also allows us to request the establishment of one or more additional term loan commitments in an aggregate amount not in excess of $80.0 million, subject to specified terms and conditions, which amount may be further increased so long as the First Lien Debt Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) is not greater than 3.25 to 1.00. The final maturity date of the Term Loan Credit Agreement is December 31, 2021.\nThe revolving credit facility as amended and restated (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\") provides that we have the option to select whether borrowings will bear interest at either (i) a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum, depending on the utilization of the facility, plus the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) or (ii) a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum, depending on the utilization of the facility, plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 1%. The final maturity date of the Revolving Credit Agreement is December 31, 2019.\nThe term loan was issued at a $1.9 million discount which is being amortized over the term of the term loan.\nOur amendment to our term loan facility resulted in a significant modification to a portion of our debt under ASC 470-50 which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of $0.7 million and the expensing of certain fees paid of $0.6 million, as well as the write off of unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.9 million in the Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings under the term loan of $186.5 million, no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and remaining borrowing availability of $99.4 million.\nOur senior credit facilities include certain negative and operating covenants, including restrictions on its ability to pay dividends, and other customary covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. The senior credit facilities entered into and recorded by our subsidiaries significantly restrict its subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to Douglas Dynamics, Inc. The terms of our revolving credit facility specifically restrict subsidiaries from paying dividends if a minimum availability under the revolving credit facility is not maintained, and both senior credit facilities restrict subsidiaries from paying dividends above certain levels or at\nall if an event of default has occurred. These restrictions would affect us indirectly since we rely principally on distributions from its subsidiaries to have funds available for the payment of dividends. In addition, our revolving credit facility includes a requirement that, subject to certain exceptions, capital expenditures may not exceed $12.5 million in any calendar year (plus the unused portion of permitted capital expenditures from the preceding year subject to a $12.5 million cap and a separate one-time $15.0 million capital expenditures to be used for the consolidation of facilities and costs associated with the acquiring and/or development and construction of one new manufacturing facility) and, if certain minimum availability under the revolving credit facility is not maintained, that we comply with a monthly minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of 1.0:1.0. Compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio test is subject to certain cure rights under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the respective covenants. The credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our assets.\nIn accordance with the senior credit facilities, we are required to make additional principal prepayments over the above scheduled payments under certain conditions. This includes, in the case of the term loan facility, 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, certain insurance or condemnation events, certain debt issuances, and, within 150 days of the end of the fiscal year, 50% of excess cash flow, as defined, including a deduction for certain distributions (which percentage is reduced to 0% upon the achievement of certain leverage ratio thresholds), for any fiscal year. Excess cash flow is defined in the senior credit facilities as consolidated adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) plus a working capital adjustment less the sum of repayments of debt and capital expenditures subject to certain adjustments, interest and taxes paid in cash, management fees and certain restricted payments (including dividends or distributions). Working capital adjustment is defined in the senior credit facilities as the change in working capital, defined as current assets excluding cash and cash equivalents less current liabilities excluding current portion of long term debt. As of December 31, 2015, we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment.\nWe entered into interest rate swap agreements on February 20, 2015 to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility. The three interest rate swap agreements have notional amounts of $45.0 million, $90.0 million and $135.0 million effective for the periods December 31, 2015 through March 29, 2018, March 29, 2018 through March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020 through June 30, 2021, respectively. The interest rate swaps' negative fair value at December 31, 2015 was $1.5 million of which $0.3 million and $1.2 million are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. We have counterparty credit risk resulting from the interest rate swap, which we monitor on an on-going basis. This risk lies with one global financial institution. Under the interest rate swap agreement effective as of December 31, 2015, we will either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between 6.105% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%). Under the interest rate swap agreement effective as of March 29, 2018, we will either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between 6.916% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%). Under the interest rate swap agreement effective as of March 31, 2020, we will either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between 7.168% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%).\nDeductibility of Intangible and Goodwill Expense\nWe possess a favorable tax structure with approximately $19.0 million of annual tax-deductible intangible and goodwill amortization expense over the next three years which may be utilized in the event we have sufficient taxable income to utilize such benefit.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows at this time. Historically, we have experienced normal raw material, labor and fringe benefit inflation. To date we have been able to fully offset this inflation by providing higher value products, which command higher prices. In previous years, we have experienced significant increases in steel costs, but have been able to mitigate the effects of these increases through both temporary and permanent steel surcharges. See Risk Factors-The price of steel, a commodity necessary to manufacture our products, is highly variable. If the price of steel increases, our gross margins could decline.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nSeasonality and Year-To-Year Variability\nOur business is seasonal and also varies from year-to-year. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as well. In addition, because of this seasonality and variability, our results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of results of operations that may be achieved for a subsequent quarter or the full year, and may not be similar to results of operations experienced in prior years.\nSales of our products are significantly impacted by the level, timing and location of snowfall, with sales in any given year and region most heavily influenced by snowfall levels in the prior snow season (which we consider to begin in October and end in March) in that region. This is due to the fact that end-user demand for our products is driven primarily by the condition of their snow and ice control equipment, and in the case of professional snowplowers, by their financial ability to purchase new or replacement snow and ice control equipment, both of which are significantly affected by snowfall levels. Heavy snowfall during a given winter causes usage of our products to increase, resulting in greater wear and tear to our products and a shortening of their life cycles, thereby creating a need for replacement snow and ice control equipment and related parts and accessories. In addition, when there is a heavy snowfall in a given winter, the increased income our professional snowplowers generate from their professional snowplow activities provides them with increased purchasing power to purchase replacement snow and ice control equipment prior to the following winter. To a lesser extent, sales of our products are influenced by the timing of snowfall in a given winter. Because an early snowfall can be viewed as a sign of a heavy upcoming snow season, our end-users may respond to an early snowfall by purchasing replacement snow and ice control equipment during the current season rather that delaying purchases until after the season is over when most purchases are typically made by end-users.\nWe attempt to manage the seasonal impact of snowfall on our revenues in part through our pre-season sales program, which involves actively soliciting and encouraging pre-season distributor orders in the second and third quarters by offering our distributors a combination of pricing, payment and freight incentives during this period. These pre-season sales incentives encourage our distributors to re-stock their inventory during the second and third quarters in anticipation of the peak fourth quarter retail sales period by offering favorable pre-season pricing and payment deferral until the fourth quarter. As a result, we tend to generate our greatest volume of sales (an average of over two-thirds over the last ten years) during the second and third quarters, providing us with manufacturing visibility for the remainder of the year. By contrast, our revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter as management believes our end-users prefer to wait until the beginning of a snow season to purchase new equipment and as our distributors sell off inventory and wait for our pre-season sales incentive period to re-stock inventory. Fourth quarter sales vary from year-to-year as they are primarily driven by the level, timing and location of snowfall during the quarter. This is because most of our fourth quarter sales and shipments consist of re-orders by distributors seeking to restock inventory to meet immediate customer needs caused by snowfall during the winter months.\nOur revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter, during which period we typically experience negative earnings as the snow season draws to a close. Our first quarter revenue has varied from approximately $8.5 million to approximately $53.9 million between 2011 and 2015. During the last five-year period, net income (loss) during the first quarter has varied from a net income of approximately $1.6 million to a net loss of approximately $4.3 million, with an average net loss of $1.3 million.\nWhile our monthly working capital has averaged approximately $65 million from 2013 to 2015, because of the seasonality of our sales, we experience seasonality in our working capital needs as well. In the first quarter we require capital as we are generally required to build our inventory in anticipation of our second and third quarter sales seasons. During the second and third quarters, our working capital requirements rise as our accounts receivables increase as a result of the sale and shipment of products ordered through our pre-season sales program and we continue to build inventory. Working capital requirements peak towards the end of the third quarter (reaching an average peak\nof approximately $75.0 million over the prior three years) and then begin to decline through the fourth quarter through a reduction in accounts receivables (as it is in the fourth quarter that we receive a majority of the payments for previously shipped products).\nWe also attempt to manage the impact of seasonality and year-to-year variability on our business costs through the effective management of our assets. See Business-Our Business Strategy-Aggressive Asset Management and Profit Focus.\u201d Our asset management and profit focus strategies include:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe employment of a highly variable cost structure facilitated by a core group of workers that we supplement with a temporary workforce as sales volumes dictate, which allows us to adjust costs on an as-needed basis in response to changing demand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour enterprise-wide lean concept, which allows us to adjust production levels up or down to meet demand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe pre-season order program described above, which incentivizes distributors to place orders prior to the retail selling season; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na vertically integrated business model.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese asset management and profit focus strategies, among other management tools, allow us to adjust fixed overhead and sales, general and administrative expenditures to account for the year-to-year variability of our sales volumes. Management currently estimates that annual fixed overhead expenses generally range from approximately $35.0 million in low sales volume years to approximately $40.0 million in high sales volume years. Further, management currently estimates that annual sales, general and administrative expenses other than amortization generally approximate $43.0 million, but can be reduced to approximately $35.0 million to maximize cash flow in low sales volume years, and can increase to approximately $48.0 million to maintain customer service and responsiveness in high sales volume years.\nAdditionally, although modest, our annual capital expenditure requirements, which are normally budgeted at $7.0 million, can be temporarily reduced by up to approximately 40% in response to actual or anticipated decreases in sales volumes. If we are unsuccessful in our asset management initiatives, the seasonality and year-to-year variability effects on our business may be compounded and in turn our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.", "item_7_truncated": "We possess a favorable tax structure with approximately $19.0 million of annual tax-deductible intangible and goodwill amortization expense over the next three years which may be utilized in the event we have sufficient taxable income to utilize such benefit.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash Flows (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n53,747 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n56,465 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,718 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n5.1% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(90,929) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(21,827) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n69,102 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n76.0% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n41,513 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(21,989) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(63,502) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n153.0% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease (Decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,331 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,649 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,318 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n(192.1%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales were $400.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $303.5 million in 2014, an increase of $96.9 million, or 31.9%. This increase was primarily attributable to $96.1 million in sales at Henderson, which was acquired on December 31, 2014. Due primarily to sales of snow and ice control equipment at Henderson, overall sales of snow and ice control equipment for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 37.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Due primarily to the sales of parts and accessories at Henderson, overall parts and accessories sales increased by 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Sales of non-Henderson products also slightly increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in sales of non-Henderson products was due to a record number of new product releases which commenced shipping in the third quarter of 2015.

Gross profit was $116.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $65.7 million in 2013, an increase of $50.7 million, or 77.2%, due to the increase in net sales volume described above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 33.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 38.3% for the corresponding period in 2014, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d\nWe do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows at this time. Historically, we have experienced normal raw material, labor and fringe benefit inflation. To date we have been able to fully offset this inflation by providing higher value products, which command higher prices. In previous years, we have experienced significant increases in steel costs, but have been able to mitigate the effects of these increases through both temporary and permanent steel surcharges. See Risk Factors-The price of steel, a commodity necessary to manufacture our products, is highly variable.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that other professionals, applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $2.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to a $13.3 million\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $132.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $116.3 million in 2014, an increase of $16.6 million, or 14.3%, due to the increase in net sales volume described above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased from 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 33.2% for the corresponding period in 2015, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d\n \u00b7 Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure; and \nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to zero in the corresponding period in 2013. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2014 was entirely driven by our amendment to our term loan facility resulting in a significant modification of our debt for a portion of our creditors which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of $0.7 million, write off of unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million and the expensing of certain fees of $0.6 million.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

We contributed approximately $1.8 million to our pension plans in 2015 and expect to make approximately $1.0 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2016. See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our pension plans.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $8.3 million in the corresponding period in 2013.\nIn accordance with the senior credit facilities, we are required to make additional principal prepayments over the above scheduled payments under certain conditions. This includes, in the case of the term loan facility, 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, certain insurance or condemnation events, certain debt issuances, and, within 150 days of the end of the fiscal year, 50% of excess cash flow, as defined, including a deduction for certain distributions (which percentage is reduced to 0% upon the achievement of certain leverage ratio thresholds), for any fiscal year. Excess cash flow is defined in the senior credit facilities as consolidated adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) plus a working capital adjustment less the sum of repayments of debt and capital expenditures subject to certain adjustments, interest and taxes paid in cash, management fees and certain restricted payments (including dividends or distributions). Working capital adjustment is defined in the senior credit facilities as the change in working capital, defined as current assets excluding cash and cash equivalents less current liabilities excluding current portion of long term debt. As of December 31, 2015, we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment.\n \u00b7 successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets. \nThe most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to pension obligations, recovery of accounts receivable, impairment assessment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as estimates used in the determination of the lower of cost or market value of inventory and liabilities related to taxation and product warranty.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $63.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was largely due to a $77.5 million net increase in 2014 resulting from borrowing and payments of long term debt. The net increase in 2014 was a result of the Company amending and restating its senior credit facility to fund the Henderson acquisition, which included borrowings of long term debt of $188.1 million, partially offset by repayment of existing debt of $111.8 million. In 2015, we had no similar increase and made $1.9 million in repayments of long term debt. In conjunction with amending the Company's senior credit facility, $2.1 million in financing costs were paid in 2014. We also paid dividends of $19.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to dividends paid of $20.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. We had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at either December 31, 2014 or December 31, 2015.\n\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying value of such assets to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment provision is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value of the asset, less costs of disposition. Our management considers such factors as current results, trends and future prospects, current market value, and other economic and regulatory factors in performing these analyses. We determined that no long-lived assets were impaired as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nPrior to the December 31, 2014 changes to our senior credit facilities, the interest on the $125.0 million term loan facility was (at our option) (i) 3.25% per annum plus the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) 1.00% plus the greater of (1) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the statutory reserve rate and (2) 1.50% or (ii) 4.25% per annum plus the greater of (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate and (b) 1.50%. Under the revolving credit facility prior to December 31, 2014, we had the option to select whether borrowings would bear interest at either (i) 1.75% per annum plus the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate or (ii) 0.75% per annum plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 1%.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOur business is seasonal and also varies from year-to-year. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as well. In addition, because of this seasonality and variability, our results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of results of operations that may be achieved for a subsequent quarter or the full year, and may not be similar to results of operations experienced in prior years.\nDuring the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2015, snowfall was 3,592 inches, which was 17.3% higher than average. Meanwhile, during the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2014, we experienced snowfall that was 42.1% higher than average. During the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2013, we experienced snowfall that was 6.9% higher than average. We believe the above average snowfall in the three consecutive years ending December 31, 2013, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 was the largest driver that positively impacted our business in 2015. Additionally, we believe other factors had a positive impact as well. These additional factors included a record number of new products launched in 2015, positively trending light truck sales in 2015 and the successful integration of Henderson.\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \nWe attempt to manage the seasonal impact of snowfall on our revenues in part through our pre-season sales program, which involves actively soliciting and encouraging pre-season distributor orders in the second and third quarters by offering our distributors a combination of pricing, payment and freight incentives during this period. These pre-season sales incentives encourage our distributors to re-stock their inventory during the second and third quarters in anticipation of the peak fourth quarter retail sales period by offering favorable pre-season pricing and payment deferral until the fourth quarter. As a result, we tend to generate our greatest volume of sales (an average of over two-thirds over the last ten years) during the second and third quarters, providing us with manufacturing visibility for the remainder of the year. By contrast, our revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter as management believes our end-users prefer to wait until the beginning of a snow season to purchase new equipment and as our distributors sell off inventory and wait for our pre-season sales incentive period to re-stock inventory. Fourth quarter sales vary from year-to-year as they are primarily driven by the level, timing and location of snowfall during the quarter. This is because most of our fourth quarter sales and shipments consist of re-orders by distributors seeking to restock inventory to meet immediate customer needs caused by snowfall during the winter months.\n\n\nAdditionally, although modest, our annual capital expenditure requirements, which are normally budgeted at $7.0 million, can be temporarily reduced by up to approximately 40% in response to actual or anticipated decreases in sales volumes. If we are unsuccessful in our asset management initiatives, the seasonality and year-to-year variability effects on our business may be compounded and in turn our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $96.5 million compared to $87.9 million in 2014, an increase of $8.6 million, or 9.8%. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA decreased from 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $87.9 million compared to $44.6 million in 2013, an increase of $43.4 million, or 97.3%. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA increased from 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition to the specific changes resulting from the adjustments, the changes to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods discussed resulted from factors discussed above under -Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe offer a variety of discounts and sales incentives to our distributors. The estimated liability for sales discounts and allowances is recorded at the time of sale as a reduction of net sales. The liability is estimated based on the costs of the program, the planned duration of the program and historical experience.\nWe also attempt to manage the impact of seasonality and year-to-year variability on our business costs through the effective management of our assets. See Business-Our Business Strategy-Aggressive Asset Management and Profit Focus.\u201d Our asset management and profit focus strategies include:\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n (4) Pension obligations are excluded from this table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payments related to these obligations. The minimum required contribution to our pension plans was $0.8 million in 2015 and is expected to be $1.0 million in 2016. \nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nSources and Uses of Cash\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nSenior Credit Facilities\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.\nSet forth below is summary cash flow information for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had liquidity comprised of approximately $36.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability of approximately $99.4 million under our revolving credit facility. Borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility is governed by a borrowing base, the calculation of which includes cash on hand. Accordingly, use of cash on hand may also result in a reduction in the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Furthermore, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain at least $15.0 million of borrowing availability. We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, as well as available credit under our senior credit facilities will provide adequate funds for the purposes described above for at least the next 12 months.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding period in 2013. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was largely due to $77.5 million net increase resulting from borrowing and payments of long term debt. This increase\nDuring the three-year periods described above, net cash provided by operating activities was used for funding capital investment, paying dividends, paying interest on our senior credit facilities, and funding working capital requirements during our pre-season shipping period. Additionally, cash from operations was used to fully fund the acquisition of the TrynEx business and to fund a portion of the acquisition of Henderson.\nCash Flow Analysis\nPrior to December 31, 2014, our senior credit facilities consisted of a $125.0 million term loan facility and an $80.0 million revolving credit facility with a group of banks. On December 31, 2014, in conjunction with the acquisition of Henderson, we amended and restated our senior credit facilities to, among other things, (i) increase the term loan facility by $65.0 million and (ii) increase the borrowing ability under the revolving credit agreement by $20.0 million. We made these changes to among other things, fund a portion of the Henderson acquisition. Following these changes, as of December 31, 2014, our senior credit facilities consisted of a $190.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility with a group of banks, of which $10.0 million will be available in the form of letters of credit and $5.0 million will be available for the issuance of short-term swingline loans.\nincrease in net income adjusted for reconciling items slightly offset by a $10.5 million in unfavorable working capital changes. Negatively impacting cash flow was a $6.8 million increase in accounts receivable and a $4.9 million increase in refundable income taxes paid.\nOur revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter, during which period we typically experience negative earnings as the snow season draws to a close. Our first quarter revenue has varied from approximately $8.5 million to approximately $53.9 million between 2011 and 2015. During the last five-year period, net income (loss) during the first quarter has varied from a net income of approximately $1.6 million to a net loss of approximately $4.3 million, with an average net loss of $1.3 million.\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA. \nOur principal sources of cash have been and we expect will continue to be cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facilities.\n (1) Reflects $3,951 and $555 in earn out compensation and inventory related to TrynEx that was written up for purchase accounting and sold in the year ended 2013.

Reflects $322 and $1,956 in earn out compensation expense related to Henderson and inventory step up related to Henderson included in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2015. \nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $69.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This decrease was due to the $86.7 million in cash outflow in 2014 for the Henderson acquisition as compared to $11.8 million in additional outflows 2015 to complete the Henderson acquisition. Slightly offsetting this decrease, cash used in investing increased as a result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2015 as compared to 2014 by $4.8 million due to facility remodels and large expenditures related to equipment.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the consolidated statements of income of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the table below and throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d consolidated statements of income data for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales of our products are significantly impacted by the level, timing and location of snowfall, with sales in any given year and region most heavily influenced by snowfall levels in the prior snow season (which we consider to begin in October and end in March) in that region. This is due to the fact that end-user demand for our products is driven primarily by the condition of their snow and ice control equipment, and in the case of professional snowplowers, by their financial ability to purchase new or replacement snow and ice control equipment, both of which are significantly affected by snowfall levels. Heavy snowfall during a given winter causes usage of our products to increase, resulting in greater wear and tear to our products and a shortening of their life cycles, thereby creating a need for replacement snow and ice control equipment and related parts and accessories. In addition, when there is a heavy snowfall in a given winter, the increased income our professional snowplowers generate from their professional snowplow activities provides them with increased purchasing power to purchase replacement snow and ice control equipment prior to the following winter. To a lesser extent, sales of our products are influenced by the timing of snowfall in a given winter. Because an early snowfall can be viewed as a sign of a heavy upcoming snow season, our end-users may respond to an early snowfall by purchasing replacement snow and ice control equipment during the current season rather that delaying purchases until after the season is over when most purchases are typically made by end-users.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for certain charges consisting of unrelated legal and consulting fees, as well as management fees paid by us to affiliates of our former principal stockholders, stock based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment on assets held for sale, certain purchase accounting expenses and offering costs. We use, and we believe our investors benefit from the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with additional tools to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our consolidated financial statements in evaluating our operating performance as compared to that of other companies, because it allows them to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Our management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with our senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\u201d that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWhile our monthly working capital has averaged approximately $65 million from 2013 to 2015, because of the seasonality of our sales, we experience seasonality in our working capital needs as well. In the first quarter we require capital as we are generally required to build our inventory in anticipation of our second and third quarter sales seasons. During the second and third quarters, our working capital requirements rise as our accounts receivables increase as a result of the sale and shipment of products ordered through our pre-season sales program and we continue to build inventory. Working capital requirements peak towards the end of the third quarter (reaching an average peak\nOur amendment to our term loan facility resulted in a significant modification to a portion of our debt under ASC 470-50 which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of $0.7 million and the expensing of certain fees paid of $0.6 million, as well as the write off of unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.9 million in the Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nImpairment of Assets Held for Sale. We recorded assets held for sale on our balance sheet in conjunction with the closure of the Johnson City, Tennessee location in 2010. The land and building had been held for sale since the closure. In an effort to stimulate sales activity, we lowered the listed sale price which caused us to reassess the fair value of the assets held for sale. Consequently, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. On February 26, 2014, we entered into an agreement for the sale of the land and building at an amount approximating the carrying amount. We closed on the sale of the Johnson City assets on April 30, 2014 with a sales price of $1.1 million and closing costs of $0.1 million. Consequently, we incurred a $0.1 million loss recognized on the disposal of assets held for sale in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out basis. We periodically review our inventory for slow-moving, damaged and discontinued items and provide reserves to reduce such items identified to their recoverable amounts.\nImpairment of Assets Held for Sale. On February 26, 2014, we entered into an agreement for the sale of land and a building located in Johnson City, Tennessee at an amount approximating the carrying amount of the assets. We closed on the sale of the Johnson City assets on April 30, 2014 with a sales price of $1.1 million and closing costs of $0.1 million. Consequently, we incurred a $0.1 million loss recognized on the disposal of assets held for sale in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet Sales. Net sales were $303.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $194.3 million in 2013, an increase of $109.2 million, or 56.2%. This increase was driven by increases of $89.8 million in sales of snow and ice control equipment and $19.4 million in parts and accessories sales. The increase in sales of snow and ice control equipment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in sales volume of snow and ice control equipment of $78.8 million, or 47.9%, as compared to the prior year, and by price increases that we implemented beginning in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 and an additional price increase that was effective in the third and fourth quarters of 2014. The increase in sales volume was largely a result of the above average snowfall in the markets we serve during the snow season ended March 31, 2014. Net sales of parts and accessories increased in the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 by 65.0%, from $29.9 million to $49.3 million. Net sales of parts and accessories remained comparatively high in 2014, above the preceding ten-year average by approximately 89%. As discussed above, the higher sales of parts and accessories was due in large part to the above average amounts of snowfall in the markets that our products are sold. Sales related to TrynEx products of $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased to $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 which also contributed to the increase in net sales for the period. Increase in TrynEx products was the result of both a full year of sales in 2014 as compared to eight months in 2013 due to the timing of our acquisition and due to above average snowfall in the markets we serve.\nWe recognize revenues upon shipment to the customer, which is when risk of loss passes and all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the price is fixed or determinable; (3) collectability is reasonably assured; and (4) the product has been shipped and we have no further obligations. Customers have no right of return privileges. Historically, product returns have not been material and are permitted on an exception basis only.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy that reflects an intention to distribute to our stockholders a regular quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of these dividends to holders of our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including our financial condition and earnings, legal requirements, taxes and other factors our Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. The terms of our indebtedness may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock under certain circumstances. As a result of this dividend policy, we may not have significant cash available to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities, including acquisitions. Our Board of Directors may, however, amend, revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason.\nFuture Obligations and Commitments\n \u00b7 a prolonged global economic crisis; \nContractual Obligations\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations. We believe that free cash flow provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations.\nWe are subject to certain contractual obligations, including long-term debt and related interest. We have net unrecognized tax benefits of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2015. However, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of potential cash settlement of the underlying liabilities; therefore, we have not included unrecognized tax benefits in calculating the obligations set forth in the following table of significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\n\nThese asset management and profit focus strategies, among other management tools, allow us to adjust fixed overhead and sales, general and administrative expenditures to account for the year-to-year variability of our sales volumes. Management currently estimates that annual fixed overhead expenses generally range from approximately $35.0 million in low sales volume years to approximately $40.0 million in high sales volume years. Further, management currently estimates that annual sales, general and administrative expenses other than amortization generally approximate $43.0 million, but can be reduced to approximately $35.0 million to maximize cash flow in low sales volume years, and can increase to approximately $48.0 million to maintain customer service and responsiveness in high sales volume years.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. As a result, you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $24.2 million at December 31, 2014 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $19.9 million at December 31, 2013. The table below sets forth a summary of the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods presented.\n \u00b7 a vertically integrated business model. \nAt December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings under the term loan of $186.5 million, no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and remaining borrowing availability of $99.4 million.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe term loan was issued at a $1.9 million discount which is being amortized over the term of the term loan.\nThe revolving credit facility as amended and restated (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\") provides that we have the option to select whether borrowings will bear interest at either (i) a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum, depending on the utilization of the facility, plus the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) or (ii) a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum, depending on the utilization of the facility, plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 1%. The final maturity date of the Revolving Credit Agreement is December 31, 2019.\nIn assessing our results of operations in a given period, one of the primary factors we consider is the level of snowfall experienced within the prior snow season. We typically compare the snowfall level in a given period both to the snowfall level in the prior season and to those snowfall levels we consider to be average. References to average snowfall\u201d levels below refer to the aggregate average inches of snowfall recorded in 66 cities in 26 snow-belt states in the United States during the annual snow season, from October 1 through March 31, from 1980 to 2015. During this period, snowfall averaged 3,062 inches, with the low in such period being 1,794 inches and the high being 4,502 inches.\n \u00b7 the employment of a highly variable cost structure facilitated by a core group of workers that we supplement with a temporary workforce as sales volumes dictate, which allows us to adjust costs on an as-needed basis in response to changing demand; \nIncome Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2014 was 35.6% compared to 38.8% for 2013. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 is lower than 2014 due to a greater domestic manufacturing deduction in 2014 driven by better operating results..\n \u00b7 Free cash flow; and \nWe are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n (3) Assumes all debt will remain outstanding until maturity. Interest payments were calculated using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2015. \nFollowing the December 31, 2014 changes to the senior credit facilities described above, the new term loan under the Term Loan Credit Agreement generally bears interest at (at our election) either (i) 3.25% per annum plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) 1.00% plus the greater of (1) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) and (2) 1.00% or (ii) 4.25% per annum plus the greater of (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate and (b) 1.00%. The Term Loan Credit Agreement also allows us to request the establishment of one or more additional term loan commitments in an aggregate amount not in excess of $80.0 million, subject to specified terms and conditions, which amount may be further increased so long as the First Lien Debt Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) is not greater than 3.25 to 1.00. The final maturity date of the Term Loan Credit Agreement is December 31, 2021.\nWe have generated significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences as well as state net operating loss carryforwards. In assessing the ability to realize these deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, excluding those relating to indefinite lived intangible assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result of this analysis, we have recorded a valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets.\n\nWarranty Cost Recognition\nDiscussion of Critical Accounting Policies\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n (2) Relates to six operating leases at Henderson truck equipment locations. \n \u00b7 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and \nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.5 million, or 25.9%. The increase compared to year ended December 31, 2014 was mostly due to expenses related to ongoing operations at Henderson of $10.5 million. Intangible amortization expense increased $1.6 million due to additional intangible assets created as a result of the Henderson acquisition. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, decreased from 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 13.8% for the corresponding period in 2015 due to sales leverage.\n \u00b7 our enterprise-wide lean concept, which allows us to adjust production levels up or down to meet demand; \n \u00b7 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.1 million in the corresponding period in 2014. Interest expense increased due to the additional borrowings resulting from the modifications made to the Company's existing term loan facility in connection with the financing of the Henderson acquisition.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2015 was 33.3% compared to 35.6% for 2014. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 is lower than 2014 due to the relief of valuation allowances in several states resulting from consecutive years of taxable income in those states.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe the following are the critical accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales was $187.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $128.7 million in 2013, an increase of $58.5 million, or 45.5%. This increase was driven primarily by increased volume of products sold. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from 66.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 61.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of higher volumes to absorb fixed spending in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally, in 2013, inflationary commodity experience was slightly favorable, while commodity costs in 2014 were slightly unfavorable. As a percentage of cost of sales, fixed and variable costs were approximately 14% and 86%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to approximately 18% and 82%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThese non-GAAP disclosures should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.\nwas a result of the Company amending and restating its senior credit facility in 2014 to fund the Henderson acquisition, which included borrowings of long term debt of $188.1 million, partially offset by repayment of existing debt of $111.8 million compared to 2013, when we made $1.2 million in repayments of long term debt. In conjunction with amending the Company's senior credit facility, $2,129 in financing costs were paid in 2014. We also paid dividends of $18.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to dividends paid of $19.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Lastly, we had $13.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2013 while we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2014.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $36.8 million at December 31, 2015 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $24.2 million at December 31, 2014. The table below sets forth a summary of the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods presented.\nIn estimating the expected return on plan assets, we analyze historical and expected returns for multiple asset classes. The overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term inflation component, the risk-free real rate of return, and the associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was then developed based upon those overall rates and the target asset allocation of the plan. Changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans, shareholders' equity and related expense. We cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and, therefore, cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant. The funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets. The projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by our employees' service adjusted for future wage increases. At December 31, 2015, our pension obligation funded status was $10.8 million underfunded.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $6.5 million, or 17.5%, primarily driven by higher incentive based compensation of $3.3 million and incremental sales and marketing expenses of $2.6 million, due to better operating results. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, decreased from 19.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 14.5% for the corresponding period in 2014 due to sales leverage.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, for each of the periods indicated.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $21.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to a $16.6 million increase in net income adjusted for reconciling items and $4.9 million in working capital changes. Negatively impacting cash flow was a $4.2 million increase in accounts receivable, net of acquisitions, due to increased sales in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013. Also, negatively impacting cash flow was an increase in inventory balances of $4.0 million, net of acquisitions. Offsetting this negative impact was an increase in accrued expenses by $6.6 million, driven primarily by increased accrued incentives and warranty reserves. Additionally, positively impacting cash flows in 2014 was a net decrease to income tax receivable (payable) balance of $3.3 million.\n\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \nWe perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived trade names and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred. Conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset. The analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two-step process. The first step is the estimation of fair value of the applicable reporting unit. We have determined we have two reporting units, and all significant decisions are made on a companywide basis by our chief operating decision maker. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated by using an income and market approach. The estimated fair value is compared with our aggregate carrying value. If our fair value is greater than the carrying amount, there is no impairment. If our carrying amount is greater than the fair value, then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment, if any.\nWe accrue for estimated warranty costs as sales are recognized and periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amount as necessary. Our warranties generally provide, with respect to our snow and ice control equipment, that all material and workmanship will be free from defect for a period of two years after the date of purchase by the end-user, and with respect to our parts and accessories purchased separately, that such parts and accessories will be free from defect for a period of one year after the date of purchase by the end-user. Certain snowplows only provide for a one year warranty. We determine the amount of the estimated warranty costs (and our corresponding warranty reserve) based on our prior five years of warranty history utilizing a formula driven by historical warranty expense and applying management's judgment. We adjust our historical warranty costs to take into account unique factors such as the introduction of new products into the marketplace that do not provide a historical warranty record to assess.\nOur goodwill and trade name balances could be impaired in future periods. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors include:\nOur senior credit facilities include certain negative and operating covenants, including restrictions on its ability to pay dividends, and other customary covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. The senior credit facilities entered into and recorded by our subsidiaries significantly restrict its subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to Douglas Dynamics, Inc. The terms of our revolving credit facility specifically restrict subsidiaries from paying dividends if a minimum availability under the revolving credit facility is not maintained, and both senior credit facilities restrict subsidiaries from paying dividends above certain levels or at\nWe carry our accounts receivable at their face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific distributor circumstances and credit conditions taking into account the history of write-offs and collections. A receivable is considered past due if payment has not been received within the period agreed upon in the invoice. Accounts receivable are written off after all collection efforts have been exhausted. We take a security interest in the inventory as collateral for the receivable but often do not have a priority security interest. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nall if an event of default has occurred. These restrictions would affect us indirectly since we rely principally on distributions from its subsidiaries to have funds available for the payment of dividends. In addition, our revolving credit facility includes a requirement that, subject to certain exceptions, capital expenditures may not exceed $12.5 million in any calendar year (plus the unused portion of permitted capital expenditures from the preceding year subject to a $12.5 million cap and a separate one-time $15.0 million capital expenditures to be used for the consolidation of facilities and costs associated with the acquiring and/or development and construction of one new manufacturing facility) and, if certain minimum availability under the revolving credit facility is not maintained, that we comply with a monthly minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of 1.0:1.0. Compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio test is subject to certain cure rights under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the respective covenants. The credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our assets.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $56.5 million in 2015 as compared to $53.7 in 2014. Free cash flow (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $46.5 million compared to $48.5 million in 2014, a decrease in free cash flow of $2.0 million, or 4.1%. The decrease in free cash flow is primarily a result of an increase in capital expenditures of $4.8 million due to some facility improvements and investments in equipment, slightly offset by $2.8 million more cash provided by operating activities, as discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources. In 2015, there were higher capital expenditures due to some facility improvements and investments in equipment.\nOur estimate of income taxes payable, deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws, the difference between tax and financial reporting bases and liabilities, estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions, and current accounting standards. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, we did not refinance any of our debt and therefore did not incur a loss on extinguishment. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2014 was entirely driven by our amendment to our term loan facility resulting in a significant modification of our debt for a portion of our creditors which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of $0.7 million, write off of unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million and the expensing of certain fees of $0.6 million.\nThe second step calculates the implied fair value of the goodwill, which is compared to its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by valuing all of the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit at the hypothetical fair value, assuming the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the entire reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. Annual impairment tests conducted by us on December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 resulted in no adjustment to the carrying value of our indefinite- lived intangibles and goodwill.\nof approximately $75.0 million over the prior three years) and then begin to decline through the fourth quarter through a reduction in accounts receivables (as it is in the fourth quarter that we receive a majority of the payments for previously shipped products).\nSeasonality and Year-To-Year Variability\nDefined Benefit Pension Obligation\n\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales was $267.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $187.2 million in 2014, an increase of $80.3 million, or 42.8%. This increase was driven primarily by increased volume of products sold. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 61.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 66.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven by $77.2 million in cost attributable to the $96.1 million in sales at Henderson and costs associated with the non-Henderson new products as discussed above under -Net Sales\u201d. The increases in cost of sales as a percentage of sales were primarily due to higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales for Henderson products. In addition, the cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes the recognized expense of a $2.0 million fair value purchase accounting write up of inventory that was sold during the period. As a percentage of cost of sales, fixed and variable costs were approximately 16% and 84%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to approximately 14% and 86%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $40.0 million compared to net income of $11.6 million for the corresponding period in 2013, an increase of $28.4 million. This increase was driven by the factors described above.\nSales of parts and accessories for 2015 and 2014 were $51.0 million and $49.3 million, respectively, or approximately 74% and 68% higher than annual parts and accessories sales over the preceding ten years, respectively. Sales of equipment unit sales for 2015 and 2014 were $349.4 million and $254.2 million, respectively. In 2015, equipment unit sales increased 37.4%. We believe that the increase of both parts and accessories sales and equipment unit sales in 2015 as compared to the prior calendar year is a direct result of the three consecutive years of above average snowfall noted above. Meanwhile, we believe that pent up demand due to deferred new equipment purchases started to release in the year ended December 31, 2014 in the marketplace, continued to be released in the year ended December 31, 2015 and could continue to be released in or following another year of average or better snowfall that is accompanied by stronger macro-economic conditions.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $61.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the corresponding period in 2013. This increase was due to the $86.7 million in cash outflow in 2014 to complete the Henderson acquisition, compared to the $26.7 million acquisition of the TrynEx business in 2013. Additionally, cash used in investing increased as a result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2014 as compared to 2013 by $2.5 million due to facility remodels and large expenditures related to equipment.\nWe entered into interest rate swap agreements on February 20, 2015 to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility. The three interest rate swap agreements have notional amounts of $45.0 million, $90.0 million and $135.0 million effective for the periods December 31, 2015 through March 29, 2018, March 29, 2018 through March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020 through June 30, 2021, respectively. The interest rate swaps' negative fair value at December 31, 2015 was $1.5 million of which $0.3 million and $1.2 million are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. We have counterparty credit risk resulting from the interest rate swap, which we monitor on an on-going basis. This risk lies with one global financial institution. Under the interest rate swap agreement effective as of December 31, 2015, we will either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between 6.105% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%). Under the interest rate swap agreement effective as of March 29, 2018, we will either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between 6.916% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%). Under the interest rate swap agreement effective as of March 31, 2020, we will either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between 7.168% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%).\nAccruals for uncertain tax positions, if any, are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC 740-Income Taxes. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our accounting for income taxes.\nOverview\nInventory Valuation\nRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $44.2 million compared to net income of $40.0 million for the corresponding period in 2014, an increase of $4.2 million. This increase was driven by the factors described above.\nThese non-GAAP measures include:\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; \n \u00b7 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; \nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of certain items in our consolidated statement of income data, relative to net sales:\nThe following table shows our cash and cash equivalents and inventories at December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015.\nAs discussed in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income of our pension plans are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 715-30, Defined Benefit Plans-Pension, and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance. Actuarial valuations for 2015 used a discount rate of 4.0% and 3.9% for our hourly and salary pension plans, respectively, and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.25%. Meanwhile, actuarial valuations for 2014 used a discount rate of 4.9% and 4.8% for our hourly and salary pension plans, respectively, and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.25%. Our discount rate reflects the expected future cash flow based upon our funding valuation assumptions and participant data at the beginning of the plan year. The expected future cash flow was discounted by the Principal Financial Group's yield curve for the month preceding the 2015 year end.\n \u00b7 the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner; ", "item_7_text": "We possess a favorable tax structure with approximately $19.0 million of annual tax-deductible intangible and goodwill amortization expense over the next three years which may be utilized in the event we have sufficient taxable income to utilize such benefit.\nNet Sales. Net sales were $400.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $303.5 million in 2014, an increase of $96.9 million, or 31.9%. This increase was primarily attributable to $96.1 million in sales at Henderson, which was acquired on December 31, 2014. Due primarily to sales of snow and ice control equipment at Henderson, overall sales of snow and ice control equipment for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 37.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Due primarily to the sales of parts and accessories at Henderson, overall parts and accessories sales increased by 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Sales of non-Henderson products also slightly increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in sales of non-Henderson products was due to a record number of new product releases which commenced shipping in the third quarter of 2015. Additionally contributing to the increase was the impact of three consecutive years of above average snowfall as discussed above.\n (1) Long-term debt obligation is presented net of discount of $1.6 million at December 31, 2015. \n \u00b7 a significant decrease in the demand for our products; \n \u00b7 the pre-season order program described above, which incentivizes distributors to place orders prior to the retail selling season; and \nGross Profit. Gross profit was $116.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $65.7 million in 2013, an increase of $50.7 million, or 77.2%, due to the increase in net sales volume described above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 33.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 38.3% for the corresponding period in 2014, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d\nWe do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows at this time. Historically, we have experienced normal raw material, labor and fringe benefit inflation. To date we have been able to fully offset this inflation by providing higher value products, which command higher prices. In previous years, we have experienced significant increases in steel costs, but have been able to mitigate the effects of these increases through both temporary and permanent steel surcharges. See Risk Factors-The price of steel, a commodity necessary to manufacture our products, is highly variable. If the price of steel increases, our gross margins could decline.\u201d\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax obligations whether current or deferred. \nDeductibility of Intangible and Goodwill Expense\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOur primary uses of cash are to provide working capital, meet debt service requirements, finance capital expenditures, pay dividends under our dividend policy and support our growth, including through potential acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. For a description of the seasonality of our working capital rates see -Seasonality and Year-To-Year Variability.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\n (2) Reflects legal and consulting fees of $1,061, $999, $791, $2,898 and $1,212 for the years ended 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively and a write down of asset held for sale of $647 for the year ended 2013. \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that other professionals, applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $2.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to a $13.3 million\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $132.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $116.3 million in 2014, an increase of $16.6 million, or 14.3%, due to the increase in net sales volume described above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased from 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 33.2% for the corresponding period in 2015, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Net Sales\u201d and -Cost of Sales.\u201d\n \u00b7 Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure; and \nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to zero in the corresponding period in 2013. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2014 was entirely driven by our amendment to our term loan facility resulting in a significant modification of our debt for a portion of our creditors which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of $0.7 million, write off of unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million and the expensing of certain fees of $0.6 million.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations. We contributed approximately $1.8 million to our pension plans in 2015 and expect to make approximately $1.0 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2016. See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our pension plans.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $8.3 million in the corresponding period in 2013.\nIn accordance with the senior credit facilities, we are required to make additional principal prepayments over the above scheduled payments under certain conditions. This includes, in the case of the term loan facility, 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, certain insurance or condemnation events, certain debt issuances, and, within 150 days of the end of the fiscal year, 50% of excess cash flow, as defined, including a deduction for certain distributions (which percentage is reduced to 0% upon the achievement of certain leverage ratio thresholds), for any fiscal year. Excess cash flow is defined in the senior credit facilities as consolidated adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) plus a working capital adjustment less the sum of repayments of debt and capital expenditures subject to certain adjustments, interest and taxes paid in cash, management fees and certain restricted payments (including dividends or distributions). Working capital adjustment is defined in the senior credit facilities as the change in working capital, defined as current assets excluding cash and cash equivalents less current liabilities excluding current portion of long term debt. As of December 31, 2015, we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment.\n \u00b7 successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets. \nThe most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to pension obligations, recovery of accounts receivable, impairment assessment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as estimates used in the determination of the lower of cost or market value of inventory and liabilities related to taxation and product warranty.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $63.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was largely due to a $77.5 million net increase in 2014 resulting from borrowing and payments of long term debt. The net increase in 2014 was a result of the Company amending and restating its senior credit facility to fund the Henderson acquisition, which included borrowings of long term debt of $188.1 million, partially offset by repayment of existing debt of $111.8 million. In 2015, we had no similar increase and made $1.9 million in repayments of long term debt. In conjunction with amending the Company's senior credit facility, $2.1 million in financing costs were paid in 2014. We also paid dividends of $19.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to dividends paid of $20.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. We had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at either December 31, 2014 or December 31, 2015.\n\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying value of such assets to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment provision is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value of the asset, less costs of disposition. Our management considers such factors as current results, trends and future prospects, current market value, and other economic and regulatory factors in performing these analyses. We determined that no long-lived assets were impaired as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nPrior to the December 31, 2014 changes to our senior credit facilities, the interest on the $125.0 million term loan facility was (at our option) (i) 3.25% per annum plus the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) 1.00% plus the greater of (1) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the statutory reserve rate and (2) 1.50% or (ii) 4.25% per annum plus the greater of (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate and (b) 1.50%. Under the revolving credit facility prior to December 31, 2014, we had the option to select whether borrowings would bear interest at either (i) 1.75% per annum plus the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate or (ii) 0.75% per annum plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 1%.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOur business is seasonal and also varies from year-to-year. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as well. In addition, because of this seasonality and variability, our results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of results of operations that may be achieved for a subsequent quarter or the full year, and may not be similar to results of operations experienced in prior years.\nDuring the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2015, snowfall was 3,592 inches, which was 17.3% higher than average. Meanwhile, during the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2014, we experienced snowfall that was 42.1% higher than average. During the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2013, we experienced snowfall that was 6.9% higher than average. We believe the above average snowfall in the three consecutive years ending December 31, 2013, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 was the largest driver that positively impacted our business in 2015. Additionally, we believe other factors had a positive impact as well. These additional factors included a record number of new products launched in 2015, positively trending light truck sales in 2015 and the successful integration of Henderson.\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \nWe attempt to manage the seasonal impact of snowfall on our revenues in part through our pre-season sales program, which involves actively soliciting and encouraging pre-season distributor orders in the second and third quarters by offering our distributors a combination of pricing, payment and freight incentives during this period. These pre-season sales incentives encourage our distributors to re-stock their inventory during the second and third quarters in anticipation of the peak fourth quarter retail sales period by offering favorable pre-season pricing and payment deferral until the fourth quarter. As a result, we tend to generate our greatest volume of sales (an average of over two-thirds over the last ten years) during the second and third quarters, providing us with manufacturing visibility for the remainder of the year. By contrast, our revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter as management believes our end-users prefer to wait until the beginning of a snow season to purchase new equipment and as our distributors sell off inventory and wait for our pre-season sales incentive period to re-stock inventory. Fourth quarter sales vary from year-to-year as they are primarily driven by the level, timing and location of snowfall during the quarter. This is because most of our fourth quarter sales and shipments consist of re-orders by distributors seeking to restock inventory to meet immediate customer needs caused by snowfall during the winter months.\n\n\nAdditionally, although modest, our annual capital expenditure requirements, which are normally budgeted at $7.0 million, can be temporarily reduced by up to approximately 40% in response to actual or anticipated decreases in sales volumes. If we are unsuccessful in our asset management initiatives, the seasonality and year-to-year variability effects on our business may be compounded and in turn our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $96.5 million compared to $87.9 million in 2014, an increase of $8.6 million, or 9.8%. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA decreased from 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $87.9 million compared to $44.6 million in 2013, an increase of $43.4 million, or 97.3%. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA increased from 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition to the specific changes resulting from the adjustments, the changes to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods discussed resulted from factors discussed above under -Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe offer a variety of discounts and sales incentives to our distributors. The estimated liability for sales discounts and allowances is recorded at the time of sale as a reduction of net sales. The liability is estimated based on the costs of the program, the planned duration of the program and historical experience.\nWe also attempt to manage the impact of seasonality and year-to-year variability on our business costs through the effective management of our assets. See Business-Our Business Strategy-Aggressive Asset Management and Profit Focus.\u201d Our asset management and profit focus strategies include:\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n (4) Pension obligations are excluded from this table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payments related to these obligations. The minimum required contribution to our pension plans was $0.8 million in 2015 and is expected to be $1.0 million in 2016. \nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nSources and Uses of Cash\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nSenior Credit Facilities\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.\nSet forth below is summary cash flow information for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had liquidity comprised of approximately $36.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability of approximately $99.4 million under our revolving credit facility. Borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility is governed by a borrowing base, the calculation of which includes cash on hand. Accordingly, use of cash on hand may also result in a reduction in the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Furthermore, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain at least $15.0 million of borrowing availability. We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, as well as available credit under our senior credit facilities will provide adequate funds for the purposes described above for at least the next 12 months.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding period in 2013. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was largely due to $77.5 million net increase resulting from borrowing and payments of long term debt. This increase\nDuring the three-year periods described above, net cash provided by operating activities was used for funding capital investment, paying dividends, paying interest on our senior credit facilities, and funding working capital requirements during our pre-season shipping period. Additionally, cash from operations was used to fully fund the acquisition of the TrynEx business and to fund a portion of the acquisition of Henderson.\nCash Flow Analysis\nPrior to December 31, 2014, our senior credit facilities consisted of a $125.0 million term loan facility and an $80.0 million revolving credit facility with a group of banks. On December 31, 2014, in conjunction with the acquisition of Henderson, we amended and restated our senior credit facilities to, among other things, (i) increase the term loan facility by $65.0 million and (ii) increase the borrowing ability under the revolving credit agreement by $20.0 million. We made these changes to among other things, fund a portion of the Henderson acquisition. Following these changes, as of December 31, 2014, our senior credit facilities consisted of a $190.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility with a group of banks, of which $10.0 million will be available in the form of letters of credit and $5.0 million will be available for the issuance of short-term swingline loans.\nincrease in net income adjusted for reconciling items slightly offset by a $10.5 million in unfavorable working capital changes. Negatively impacting cash flow was a $6.8 million increase in accounts receivable and a $4.9 million increase in refundable income taxes paid.\nOur revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter, during which period we typically experience negative earnings as the snow season draws to a close. Our first quarter revenue has varied from approximately $8.5 million to approximately $53.9 million between 2011 and 2015. During the last five-year period, net income (loss) during the first quarter has varied from a net income of approximately $1.6 million to a net loss of approximately $4.3 million, with an average net loss of $1.3 million.\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA. \nOur principal sources of cash have been and we expect will continue to be cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facilities.\n (1) Reflects $3,951 and $555 in earn out compensation and inventory related to TrynEx that was written up for purchase accounting and sold in the year ended 2013. Reflects $335 in earnout compensation expense related to TrynEx in the year ended December 31, 2015. Reflects $945 in earn out compensation related to TrynEx in the year ended 2014. Reflects $322 and $1,956 in earn out compensation expense related to Henderson and inventory step up related to Henderson included in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2015. \nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $69.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This decrease was due to the $86.7 million in cash outflow in 2014 for the Henderson acquisition as compared to $11.8 million in additional outflows 2015 to complete the Henderson acquisition. Slightly offsetting this decrease, cash used in investing increased as a result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2015 as compared to 2014 by $4.8 million due to facility remodels and large expenditures related to equipment.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the consolidated statements of income of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the table below and throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d consolidated statements of income data for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales of our products are significantly impacted by the level, timing and location of snowfall, with sales in any given year and region most heavily influenced by snowfall levels in the prior snow season (which we consider to begin in October and end in March) in that region. This is due to the fact that end-user demand for our products is driven primarily by the condition of their snow and ice control equipment, and in the case of professional snowplowers, by their financial ability to purchase new or replacement snow and ice control equipment, both of which are significantly affected by snowfall levels. Heavy snowfall during a given winter causes usage of our products to increase, resulting in greater wear and tear to our products and a shortening of their life cycles, thereby creating a need for replacement snow and ice control equipment and related parts and accessories. In addition, when there is a heavy snowfall in a given winter, the increased income our professional snowplowers generate from their professional snowplow activities provides them with increased purchasing power to purchase replacement snow and ice control equipment prior to the following winter. To a lesser extent, sales of our products are influenced by the timing of snowfall in a given winter. Because an early snowfall can be viewed as a sign of a heavy upcoming snow season, our end-users may respond to an early snowfall by purchasing replacement snow and ice control equipment during the current season rather that delaying purchases until after the season is over when most purchases are typically made by end-users.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for certain charges consisting of unrelated legal and consulting fees, as well as management fees paid by us to affiliates of our former principal stockholders, stock based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment on assets held for sale, certain purchase accounting expenses and offering costs. We use, and we believe our investors benefit from the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with additional tools to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our consolidated financial statements in evaluating our operating performance as compared to that of other companies, because it allows them to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Our management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with our senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\u201d that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWhile our monthly working capital has averaged approximately $65 million from 2013 to 2015, because of the seasonality of our sales, we experience seasonality in our working capital needs as well. In the first quarter we require capital as we are generally required to build our inventory in anticipation of our second and third quarter sales seasons. During the second and third quarters, our working capital requirements rise as our accounts receivables increase as a result of the sale and shipment of products ordered through our pre-season sales program and we continue to build inventory. Working capital requirements peak towards the end of the third quarter (reaching an average peak\nOur amendment to our term loan facility resulted in a significant modification to a portion of our debt under ASC 470-50 which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of $0.7 million and the expensing of certain fees paid of $0.6 million, as well as the write off of unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.9 million in the Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nImpairment of Assets Held for Sale. We recorded assets held for sale on our balance sheet in conjunction with the closure of the Johnson City, Tennessee location in 2010. The land and building had been held for sale since the closure. In an effort to stimulate sales activity, we lowered the listed sale price which caused us to reassess the fair value of the assets held for sale. Consequently, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. On February 26, 2014, we entered into an agreement for the sale of the land and building at an amount approximating the carrying amount. We closed on the sale of the Johnson City assets on April 30, 2014 with a sales price of $1.1 million and closing costs of $0.1 million. Consequently, we incurred a $0.1 million loss recognized on the disposal of assets held for sale in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out basis. We periodically review our inventory for slow-moving, damaged and discontinued items and provide reserves to reduce such items identified to their recoverable amounts.\nImpairment of Assets Held for Sale. On February 26, 2014, we entered into an agreement for the sale of land and a building located in Johnson City, Tennessee at an amount approximating the carrying amount of the assets. We closed on the sale of the Johnson City assets on April 30, 2014 with a sales price of $1.1 million and closing costs of $0.1 million. Consequently, we incurred a $0.1 million loss recognized on the disposal of assets held for sale in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet Sales. Net sales were $303.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $194.3 million in 2013, an increase of $109.2 million, or 56.2%. This increase was driven by increases of $89.8 million in sales of snow and ice control equipment and $19.4 million in parts and accessories sales. The increase in sales of snow and ice control equipment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to an increase in sales volume of snow and ice control equipment of $78.8 million, or 47.9%, as compared to the prior year, and by price increases that we implemented beginning in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 and an additional price increase that was effective in the third and fourth quarters of 2014. The increase in sales volume was largely a result of the above average snowfall in the markets we serve during the snow season ended March 31, 2014. Net sales of parts and accessories increased in the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 by 65.0%, from $29.9 million to $49.3 million. Net sales of parts and accessories remained comparatively high in 2014, above the preceding ten-year average by approximately 89%. As discussed above, the higher sales of parts and accessories was due in large part to the above average amounts of snowfall in the markets that our products are sold. Sales related to TrynEx products of $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased to $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 which also contributed to the increase in net sales for the period. Increase in TrynEx products was the result of both a full year of sales in 2014 as compared to eight months in 2013 due to the timing of our acquisition and due to above average snowfall in the markets we serve.\nWe recognize revenues upon shipment to the customer, which is when risk of loss passes and all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the price is fixed or determinable; (3) collectability is reasonably assured; and (4) the product has been shipped and we have no further obligations. Customers have no right of return privileges. Historically, product returns have not been material and are permitted on an exception basis only.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy that reflects an intention to distribute to our stockholders a regular quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of these dividends to holders of our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including our financial condition and earnings, legal requirements, taxes and other factors our Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. The terms of our indebtedness may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock under certain circumstances. As a result of this dividend policy, we may not have significant cash available to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities, including acquisitions. Our Board of Directors may, however, amend, revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason.\nFuture Obligations and Commitments\n \u00b7 a prolonged global economic crisis; \nContractual Obligations\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations. We believe that free cash flow provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations.\nWe are subject to certain contractual obligations, including long-term debt and related interest. We have net unrecognized tax benefits of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2015. However, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of potential cash settlement of the underlying liabilities; therefore, we have not included unrecognized tax benefits in calculating the obligations set forth in the following table of significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\n\nThese asset management and profit focus strategies, among other management tools, allow us to adjust fixed overhead and sales, general and administrative expenditures to account for the year-to-year variability of our sales volumes. Management currently estimates that annual fixed overhead expenses generally range from approximately $35.0 million in low sales volume years to approximately $40.0 million in high sales volume years. Further, management currently estimates that annual sales, general and administrative expenses other than amortization generally approximate $43.0 million, but can be reduced to approximately $35.0 million to maximize cash flow in low sales volume years, and can increase to approximately $48.0 million to maintain customer service and responsiveness in high sales volume years.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. As a result, you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $24.2 million at December 31, 2014 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $19.9 million at December 31, 2013. The table below sets forth a summary of the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods presented.\n \u00b7 a vertically integrated business model. \nAt December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings under the term loan of $186.5 million, no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and remaining borrowing availability of $99.4 million.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe term loan was issued at a $1.9 million discount which is being amortized over the term of the term loan.\nThe revolving credit facility as amended and restated (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\") provides that we have the option to select whether borrowings will bear interest at either (i) a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum, depending on the utilization of the facility, plus the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) or (ii) a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum, depending on the utilization of the facility, plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 1%. The final maturity date of the Revolving Credit Agreement is December 31, 2019.\nIn assessing our results of operations in a given period, one of the primary factors we consider is the level of snowfall experienced within the prior snow season. We typically compare the snowfall level in a given period both to the snowfall level in the prior season and to those snowfall levels we consider to be average. References to average snowfall\u201d levels below refer to the aggregate average inches of snowfall recorded in 66 cities in 26 snow-belt states in the United States during the annual snow season, from October 1 through March 31, from 1980 to 2015. During this period, snowfall averaged 3,062 inches, with the low in such period being 1,794 inches and the high being 4,502 inches.\n \u00b7 the employment of a highly variable cost structure facilitated by a core group of workers that we supplement with a temporary workforce as sales volumes dictate, which allows us to adjust costs on an as-needed basis in response to changing demand; \nIncome Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2014 was 35.6% compared to 38.8% for 2013. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 is lower than 2014 due to a greater domestic manufacturing deduction in 2014 driven by better operating results..\n \u00b7 Free cash flow; and \nWe are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n (3) Assumes all debt will remain outstanding until maturity. Interest payments were calculated using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2015. \nFollowing the December 31, 2014 changes to the senior credit facilities described above, the new term loan under the Term Loan Credit Agreement generally bears interest at (at our election) either (i) 3.25% per annum plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) 1.00% plus the greater of (1) the London Interbank Offered Rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) and (2) 1.00% or (ii) 4.25% per annum plus the greater of (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate and (b) 1.00%. The Term Loan Credit Agreement also allows us to request the establishment of one or more additional term loan commitments in an aggregate amount not in excess of $80.0 million, subject to specified terms and conditions, which amount may be further increased so long as the First Lien Debt Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) is not greater than 3.25 to 1.00. The final maturity date of the Term Loan Credit Agreement is December 31, 2021.\nWe have generated significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences as well as state net operating loss carryforwards. In assessing the ability to realize these deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, excluding those relating to indefinite lived intangible assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result of this analysis, we have recorded a valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets.\n\nWarranty Cost Recognition\nDiscussion of Critical Accounting Policies\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n (2) Relates to six operating leases at Henderson truck equipment locations. \n \u00b7 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and \nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.5 million, or 25.9%. The increase compared to year ended December 31, 2014 was mostly due to expenses related to ongoing operations at Henderson of $10.5 million. Intangible amortization expense increased $1.6 million due to additional intangible assets created as a result of the Henderson acquisition. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, decreased from 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 13.8% for the corresponding period in 2015 due to sales leverage.\n \u00b7 our enterprise-wide lean concept, which allows us to adjust production levels up or down to meet demand; \n \u00b7 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.1 million in the corresponding period in 2014. Interest expense increased due to the additional borrowings resulting from the modifications made to the Company's existing term loan facility in connection with the financing of the Henderson acquisition.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2015 was 33.3% compared to 35.6% for 2014. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 is lower than 2014 due to the relief of valuation allowances in several states resulting from consecutive years of taxable income in those states.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe the following are the critical accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales was $187.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $128.7 million in 2013, an increase of $58.5 million, or 45.5%. This increase was driven primarily by increased volume of products sold. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from 66.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 61.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of higher volumes to absorb fixed spending in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally, in 2013, inflationary commodity experience was slightly favorable, while commodity costs in 2014 were slightly unfavorable. As a percentage of cost of sales, fixed and variable costs were approximately 14% and 86%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to approximately 18% and 82%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThese non-GAAP disclosures should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.\nwas a result of the Company amending and restating its senior credit facility in 2014 to fund the Henderson acquisition, which included borrowings of long term debt of $188.1 million, partially offset by repayment of existing debt of $111.8 million compared to 2013, when we made $1.2 million in repayments of long term debt. In conjunction with amending the Company's senior credit facility, $2,129 in financing costs were paid in 2014. We also paid dividends of $18.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to dividends paid of $19.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Lastly, we had $13.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2013 while we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2014.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $36.8 million at December 31, 2015 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $24.2 million at December 31, 2014. The table below sets forth a summary of the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods presented.\nIn estimating the expected return on plan assets, we analyze historical and expected returns for multiple asset classes. The overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term inflation component, the risk-free real rate of return, and the associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was then developed based upon those overall rates and the target asset allocation of the plan. Changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans, shareholders' equity and related expense. We cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and, therefore, cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant. The funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets. The projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by our employees' service adjusted for future wage increases. At December 31, 2015, our pension obligation funded status was $10.8 million underfunded.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $6.5 million, or 17.5%, primarily driven by higher incentive based compensation of $3.3 million and incremental sales and marketing expenses of $2.6 million, due to better operating results. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, decreased from 19.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 14.5% for the corresponding period in 2014 due to sales leverage.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, for each of the periods indicated.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $21.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to a $16.6 million increase in net income adjusted for reconciling items and $4.9 million in working capital changes. Negatively impacting cash flow was a $4.2 million increase in accounts receivable, net of acquisitions, due to increased sales in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013. Also, negatively impacting cash flow was an increase in inventory balances of $4.0 million, net of acquisitions. Offsetting this negative impact was an increase in accrued expenses by $6.6 million, driven primarily by increased accrued incentives and warranty reserves. Additionally, positively impacting cash flows in 2014 was a net decrease to income tax receivable (payable) balance of $3.3 million.\n\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \nWe perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived trade names and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred. Conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset. The analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two-step process. The first step is the estimation of fair value of the applicable reporting unit. We have determined we have two reporting units, and all significant decisions are made on a companywide basis by our chief operating decision maker. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated by using an income and market approach. The estimated fair value is compared with our aggregate carrying value. If our fair value is greater than the carrying amount, there is no impairment. If our carrying amount is greater than the fair value, then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment, if any.\nWe accrue for estimated warranty costs as sales are recognized and periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amount as necessary. Our warranties generally provide, with respect to our snow and ice control equipment, that all material and workmanship will be free from defect for a period of two years after the date of purchase by the end-user, and with respect to our parts and accessories purchased separately, that such parts and accessories will be free from defect for a period of one year after the date of purchase by the end-user. Certain snowplows only provide for a one year warranty. We determine the amount of the estimated warranty costs (and our corresponding warranty reserve) based on our prior five years of warranty history utilizing a formula driven by historical warranty expense and applying management's judgment. We adjust our historical warranty costs to take into account unique factors such as the introduction of new products into the marketplace that do not provide a historical warranty record to assess.\nOur goodwill and trade name balances could be impaired in future periods. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors include:\nOur senior credit facilities include certain negative and operating covenants, including restrictions on its ability to pay dividends, and other customary covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. The senior credit facilities entered into and recorded by our subsidiaries significantly restrict its subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to Douglas Dynamics, Inc. The terms of our revolving credit facility specifically restrict subsidiaries from paying dividends if a minimum availability under the revolving credit facility is not maintained, and both senior credit facilities restrict subsidiaries from paying dividends above certain levels or at\nWe carry our accounts receivable at their face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific distributor circumstances and credit conditions taking into account the history of write-offs and collections. A receivable is considered past due if payment has not been received within the period agreed upon in the invoice. Accounts receivable are written off after all collection efforts have been exhausted. We take a security interest in the inventory as collateral for the receivable but often do not have a priority security interest. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nall if an event of default has occurred. These restrictions would affect us indirectly since we rely principally on distributions from its subsidiaries to have funds available for the payment of dividends. In addition, our revolving credit facility includes a requirement that, subject to certain exceptions, capital expenditures may not exceed $12.5 million in any calendar year (plus the unused portion of permitted capital expenditures from the preceding year subject to a $12.5 million cap and a separate one-time $15.0 million capital expenditures to be used for the consolidation of facilities and costs associated with the acquiring and/or development and construction of one new manufacturing facility) and, if certain minimum availability under the revolving credit facility is not maintained, that we comply with a monthly minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of 1.0:1.0. Compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio test is subject to certain cure rights under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the respective covenants. The credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our assets.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $56.5 million in 2015 as compared to $53.7 in 2014. Free cash flow (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $46.5 million compared to $48.5 million in 2014, a decrease in free cash flow of $2.0 million, or 4.1%. The decrease in free cash flow is primarily a result of an increase in capital expenditures of $4.8 million due to some facility improvements and investments in equipment, slightly offset by $2.8 million more cash provided by operating activities, as discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources. In 2015, there were higher capital expenditures due to some facility improvements and investments in equipment.\nOur estimate of income taxes payable, deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws, the difference between tax and financial reporting bases and liabilities, estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions, and current accounting standards. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, we did not refinance any of our debt and therefore did not incur a loss on extinguishment. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2014 was entirely driven by our amendment to our term loan facility resulting in a significant modification of our debt for a portion of our creditors which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of $0.7 million, write off of unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million and the expensing of certain fees of $0.6 million.\nThe second step calculates the implied fair value of the goodwill, which is compared to its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by valuing all of the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit at the hypothetical fair value, assuming the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the entire reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. Annual impairment tests conducted by us on December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 resulted in no adjustment to the carrying value of our indefinite- lived intangibles and goodwill.\nof approximately $75.0 million over the prior three years) and then begin to decline through the fourth quarter through a reduction in accounts receivables (as it is in the fourth quarter that we receive a majority of the payments for previously shipped products).\nSeasonality and Year-To-Year Variability\nDefined Benefit Pension Obligation\n\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales was $267.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $187.2 million in 2014, an increase of $80.3 million, or 42.8%. This increase was driven primarily by increased volume of products sold. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 61.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 66.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven by $77.2 million in cost attributable to the $96.1 million in sales at Henderson and costs associated with the non-Henderson new products as discussed above under -Net Sales\u201d. The increases in cost of sales as a percentage of sales were primarily due to higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales for Henderson products. In addition, the cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes the recognized expense of a $2.0 million fair value purchase accounting write up of inventory that was sold during the period. As a percentage of cost of sales, fixed and variable costs were approximately 16% and 84%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to approximately 14% and 86%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $40.0 million compared to net income of $11.6 million for the corresponding period in 2013, an increase of $28.4 million. This increase was driven by the factors described above.\nSales of parts and accessories for 2015 and 2014 were $51.0 million and $49.3 million, respectively, or approximately 74% and 68% higher than annual parts and accessories sales over the preceding ten years, respectively. Sales of equipment unit sales for 2015 and 2014 were $349.4 million and $254.2 million, respectively. In 2015, equipment unit sales increased 37.4%. We believe that the increase of both parts and accessories sales and equipment unit sales in 2015 as compared to the prior calendar year is a direct result of the three consecutive years of above average snowfall noted above. Meanwhile, we believe that pent up demand due to deferred new equipment purchases started to release in the year ended December 31, 2014 in the marketplace, continued to be released in the year ended December 31, 2015 and could continue to be released in or following another year of average or better snowfall that is accompanied by stronger macro-economic conditions.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $61.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the corresponding period in 2013. This increase was due to the $86.7 million in cash outflow in 2014 to complete the Henderson acquisition, compared to the $26.7 million acquisition of the TrynEx business in 2013. Additionally, cash used in investing increased as a result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2014 as compared to 2013 by $2.5 million due to facility remodels and large expenditures related to equipment.\nWe entered into interest rate swap agreements on February 20, 2015 to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility. The three interest rate swap agreements have notional amounts of $45.0 million, $90.0 million and $135.0 million effective for the periods December 31, 2015 through March 29, 2018, March 29, 2018 through March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020 through June 30, 2021, respectively. The interest rate swaps' negative fair value at December 31, 2015 was $1.5 million of which $0.3 million and $1.2 million are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. We have counterparty credit risk resulting from the interest rate swap, which we monitor on an on-going basis. This risk lies with one global financial institution. Under the interest rate swap agreement effective as of December 31, 2015, we will either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between 6.105% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%). Under the interest rate swap agreement effective as of March 29, 2018, we will either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between 6.916% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%). Under the interest rate swap agreement effective as of March 31, 2020, we will either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between 7.168% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%).\nAccruals for uncertain tax positions, if any, are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC 740-Income Taxes. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our accounting for income taxes.\nOverview\nInventory Valuation\nRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $44.2 million compared to net income of $40.0 million for the corresponding period in 2014, an increase of $4.2 million. This increase was driven by the factors described above.\nThese non-GAAP measures include:\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; \n \u00b7 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; \nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of certain items in our consolidated statement of income data, relative to net sales:\nThe following table shows our cash and cash equivalents and inventories at December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015.\nAs discussed in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income of our pension plans are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 715-30, Defined Benefit Plans-Pension, and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance. Actuarial valuations for 2015 used a discount rate of 4.0% and 3.9% for our hourly and salary pension plans, respectively, and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.25%. Meanwhile, actuarial valuations for 2014 used a discount rate of 4.9% and 4.8% for our hourly and salary pension plans, respectively, and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.25%. Our discount rate reflects the expected future cash flow based upon our funding valuation assumptions and participant data at the beginning of the plan year. The expected future cash flow was discounted by the Principal Financial Group's yield curve for the month preceding the 2015 year end.\n \u00b7 the inability to develop new and enhanced products and
