Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included herein. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere herein. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nOur mission is to deliver the best car-buying experience for consumers and provide dealers and automakers with an excellent return on their marketing dollars. We have established an intelligent, data-driven online platform operating on a common technology infrastructure, powered by proprietary data and analytics. We operate our company-branded platform on the TrueCar website and our branded mobile experience. In addition, we customize and operate our platform on a co-branded basis for our many affinity group marketing partners, including financial institutions like USAA and American Express, membership-based organizations like Consumer Reports, AARP, Sam's Club, and AAA, and employee buying programs for large enterprises such as IBM and Walmart. We enable users to obtain market-based pricing data on new and used cars, and to connect with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We also allow automobile manufacturers, known in the industry as OEMs, to connect with TrueCar users in the purchase process and efficiently deliver targeted incentives to consumers.\nWe benefit consumers by providing information related to what others have paid for a make and model of car in their area and, where available, estimated prices for that make and model, which we refer to as upfront pricing information, from our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. This upfront pricing information generally includes guaranteed savings off MSRP which the consumer may then take to the dealer in the form of a Guaranteed Savings Certificate and apply toward the purchase of the specified make and model of car. We benefit our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers by enabling them to attract these informed, in-market consumers in a cost-effective, accountable manner, which we believe helps them to sell more cars profitably. We benefit OEMs by allowing them to more effectively target their incentive spending at deep-in-market consumers during their purchase process.\nOur subsidiary, ALG, Inc., provides forecasts and consulting services regarding determination of the residual value of an automobile at given future points in time. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition, financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease, and fleet portfolios. We also obtain automobile purchase data from a variety of sources and use this data to provide consumers and dealers with highly accurate, geographically specific, real-time pricing information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated revenues of $259.8 million and recorded a net loss of $64.9 million. Of the $259.8 million in revenues, 92.9% consisted of transaction revenues with the remaining 7.1% derived primarily from the sale of forecasts, consulting and other services to the automotive and financial services industries. Revenues from the sale of forecasts, consulting and other services are derived primarily from the operations of our ALG subsidiary. Transaction revenues primarily consist of fees paid to us by our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers under our pay-for-performance business model where we generally earn a fee only when a TrueCar user purchases a car from them.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make operating and strategic decisions.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Monthly Unique Visitors\n</td> <td>5,999,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,296,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,780,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units(1)\n</td> <td>750,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>610,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>399,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monetization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Dealer Count\n</td> <td>9,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction Revenue Per Franchise Dealer\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We issued full credits of the amount originally invoiced with respect to 12,484, 8,779, and 17,664 units during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The number of units has not been adjusted downwards related to units credited as discussed in the description of the unit metric below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Monthly Unique Visitors\nWe define a monthly unique visitor as an individual who has visited our website, our landing page on our affinity group marketing partner sites, or our mobile applications within a calendar month. We identify unique visitors through cookies for browser-based visits on either a desktop computer or mobile device and through device IDs for mobile application visits. In addition, if a TrueCar.com user logs-in, we supplement their identification with their log-in credentials to attempt to avoid double counting on TrueCar.com across devices, browsers and mobile applications. If an individual accesses our service using different devices or different browsers on the same device within a given month, the first access through each such device or browser is counted as a separate monthly unique visitor, except where adjusted based upon TrueCar.com log-in information. We calculate average monthly unique visitors as the sum of the monthly unique visitors in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We view our average monthly unique visitors as a key indicator of the growth in our business and audience reach, the strength of our brand, and the visibility of car buying services to the member base of our affinity group marketing partners.\nThe number of average monthly unique visitors increased 39.6% to approximately 6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from approximately 4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. We attribute the growth in our average monthly unique visitors principally to increased television and digital marketing advertising campaigns that have led to increased brand awareness, as well as increased traffic from our affinity group marketing partners.\nUnits\nWe define units as the number of automobiles purchased by our users from TrueCar Certified Dealers through TrueCar.com, our TrueCar branded mobile applications or the car buying sites we maintain for our affinity group marketing partners. A unit is counted following such time as we have matched the sale to a TrueCar user with one of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We view units as a key indicator of the growth of our business, the effectiveness of our product and the size and geographic coverage of our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers.\nOn occasion we issue credits to our TrueCar Certified Dealers with respect to units sold. However, we do not adjust our unit metric for these credits as we believe that in substantially all cases a vehicle has in fact been purchased through our platform given the high degree of accuracy of our sales matching process. Credits are most frequently issued to a dealer that claims it had a pre-existing relationship with a purchaser of a vehicle, and we determine whether to issue a credit based on a number of factors, including the facts and circumstances related to the dealer claim and the level of claim activity at the dealership. In most cases, we issue credits in order to maintain strong business relations with the dealer and not because we have made an erroneous sales match or billing error.\nThe number of units increased 22.8% to 750,108 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 610,620 for the year ended December 31, 2014. We attribute this growth in units to the effectiveness of our increased marketing activities, product enhancements, the growing number and geographic coverage of TrueCar Certified Dealers in our network, and the overall growth in new car sales in the automotive industry.\nMonetization\nWe define monetization as the average transaction revenue per unit, which we calculate by dividing all of our transaction revenue in a given period by the number of units in that period. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our monetization increased 3.9% to $322 from $310 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in monetization is primarily a result of improved subscription pricing optimization and growth in used vs new mix, the independent dealer channel, and in revenue from automobile manufacturers, known in the industry as OEMs. We expect our monetization to be affected in the future by changes in our pricing structure, the unit mix between new and used cars, with used cars providing higher monetization, and by the introduction of new products and services.\nFranchise Dealer Count\nWe define franchise dealer count as the number of franchise dealers in the network of TrueCar Certified Dealers at the end of a given period. This number is calculated by counting the number of brands of new cars sold by dealers in the TrueCar Certified Dealer network at their locations, and includes both single-location proprietorships as well as large consolidated dealer groups. The network comprises dealers with a range of unit sales volume per dealer, with dealers representing certain brands consistently achieving higher than average unit sales volume. We view our ability to increase our franchise dealer count, particularly dealers representing high volume brands, as an indicator of our market penetration and the likelihood of converting users of our platform into unit sales.\nOur TrueCar Certified Dealer network includes non-franchised dealers that primarily sell used cars and are not included in franchise dealer count. Our franchise dealer count increased to 9,094 at December 31, 2015 from 8,501 at December 31, 2014 and 6,651 at December 31, 2013. A disproportionate number of the net franchise dealer additions in the second half of 2015 represented relatively lower unit volume dealers. We intend to increase the number of dealers representing high volume brands in our dealer network generally, and in key geographies, by investing to improve the dealer experience and increasing dealer satisfaction.\nTransaction Revenue per Franchise Dealer\nWe define transaction revenue per franchise dealer as the aggregate transaction revenue we receive in a given period divided by the average franchise dealer count in that period. We calculate average franchise dealer count in a given period as the average of the franchise dealer count at the beginning of the period and the franchise dealer count at the end of the period. Our transaction revenue per franchise dealer increased 9.8% to $27,439 during the year ended December 31, 2015 from $24,994 for the year ended December 31, 2014. These increases primarily reflect an increase in units which was attributable to an increase in marketing spend and an increase in the number of TrueCar Certified Dealers, platform and product enhancements, and the overall growth in sales of the automotive industry.\nPresentation of Financial Statements\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries in accordance with FASB ASC 810 - Consolidation. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe report our financial results as one operating segment, with two distinct service offerings: transactions, and forecasts, consulting and other. Our operating results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker on a consolidated basis, principally to make decisions about how we allocate our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance. Our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews revenue for each of our transaction and data and other offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the factors driving our business.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenues\nOur revenues are comprised of transaction revenues, and forecasts, consulting and other revenue.\nTransaction Revenue. Revenue consists of fees paid by dealers participating in our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. Dealers pay us these fees either on a per vehicle basis for sales to our users or in the form of a subscription arrangement. Subscription arrangements fall into three types: flat rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales ( guaranteed sales\u201d) and subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions ( guaranteed introductions\u201d). Under flat rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of sales made to users of our platform by the dealer. For flat rate subscription arrangements, we recognize the fees as revenue over the subscription period on a straight line basis which corresponds to the period that we are providing the dealer with access to our platform. Under guaranteed sales subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. Under guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees. For guaranteed sales and guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, we recognize revenue based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of sales generated or introductions delivered through our platform during the subscription period multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction or (ii) the guaranteed number of sales or introductions multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction.\nIn addition, we enter into arrangements with automobile manufacturers to promote the sale of their vehicles through the offering of additional consumer incentives to members of our affinity group marketing partners. These manufacturers pay us a per-vehicle fee for promotion of the incentive and we recognize the per-vehicle incentive fee when the vehicle sale has occurred between the member of our affinity group marketing partner and the dealer.\nForecasts, Consulting and Other Revenue. \"Data and other revenue\" as disclosed in periods prior to 2015 is now referred to as \"forecasts, consulting and other revenue\" as we believe this description is more accurate and reflective of the actual service offerings that we provide. We derive this type of revenue primarily from the provision of forecasts and consulting services to the automotive and financial services industries through our ALG subsidiary. The forecasts and consulting services that ALG provides typically relate to the determination of the residual value of an automobile at given future points in time. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition, financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease and fleet portfolios. Our customers generally pay us for these services as information is delivered to them.\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Cost of revenue includes expenses related to the fulfillment of our services, consisting primarily of data costs and licensing fees paid to third party service providers and expenses related to operating our website and mobile applications, including those associated with our data centers, hosting fees, data processing costs required to deliver introductions to our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers, employee costs related to dealer operations, sales matching, and employee and consulting costs related to delivering data and consulting services to our customers. Cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization of software costs and other hosting and data infrastructure equipment used to operate our platforms, which are included in the depreciation and amortization line item on our statement of comprehensive loss.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of: television and radio advertising; affinity group partner marketing fees, which also includes loan subvention costs where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of consumers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners, and common stock warrants issued to USAA; marketing sponsorship programs; and digital customer acquisition. See Part III, Item 13 Certain Relationships, Related Party and Other Transactions - Strategic Partnerships - United Services Automobile Association\u201d for a description of our arrangements with USAA. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include employee related expenses for sales, customer support, marketing and public relations employees, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses; third-party contractor fees; and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include costs related to common stock warrants issued to a third-party marketing firm and a service provider as part of our commercial arrangements with them. Marketing and advertising costs promote our services and are expensed as incurred, except for media production costs which are expensed the first time the advertisement is aired.\nTechnology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance and stock-based compensation expenses, third-party contractor fees, and allocated overhead primarily associated with development of our platform, as well as our product development, product management, research and analytics and internal IT functions.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses for executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, and business intelligence personnel. General and administrative expenses also include legal, accounting, and other third-party professional service fees, bad debt, lease exit costs, and allocated overhead.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation consists primarily of depreciation expense recorded on property and equipment. Amortization expense consists primarily of amortization recorded on intangible assets, capitalized software costs and leasehold improvements.\nInterest Income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest on our built-to-suit lease financing obligation, on our outstanding short-term debt obligations, and for the period from May 2012 to May 2013, accretion of debt discount resulting from a beneficial conversion feature on our convertible debt, which converted to equity in May 2013. In addition, beginning in August 2013, interest expense includes interest on our credit facility and the amortization of the discount on our line of credit. See Notes 5 and 6 of our consolidated financial statements included herein for more information about our debt obligations.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. We provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 as it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result of the valuation allowance, our income tax benefit (or expense) is significantly less than the federal statutory rate of 34%. Our provision for income taxes in 2015, 2014, and 2013 primarily\nreflect a tax expense associated with the amortization of tax deductible goodwill that is not an available source of income to realize deferred tax assets.\nWe have accumulated federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $221.2 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $156.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nSee Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included herein for more information about our provision for income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets

Transaction revenue and forecasts, consulting and other revenue comprised 92.9% and 7.1%, respectively, of revenues for 2015 as compared to 91.6% and 8.4%, respectively, for 2014. The increase in transaction revenue for 2015 primarily reflected a 22.8% increase in units due to an increase in marketing spend and an increase in the number of TrueCar Certified Dealers, platform and product enhancements, and the overall growth in sales of the automotive industry. Our average monthly unique visitors grew 39.6% to 6.0 million during 2015 from 4.3 million during 2014, reflecting our increased advertising expenses which improved brand awareness and the visibility of our car buying services to our users. Our monetization increased 3.9% to $322 during 2015 from $310 for 2014, primarily as a result of improved subscription pricing optimization and growth in used vehicle vs. new vehicle mix, the independent dealer channel, and in revenue from OEMs. Monetization may fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in our estimated sales allowance, pricing and the unit mix between new and used cars. The 6.6% increase in forecasts, consulting and other revenue for 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflected an increase in volume of portfolio risk analyses and residual value forecasts provided to customers. We expect revenues to grow modestly in 2016.\nDuring the second half of 2015, we experienced a decline in the proportion of dealers representing high volume brands in our network and slowed quarter over quarter revenue growth. A disproportionate number of the net franchise dealer additions in the second half of 2015 represented relatively lower unit volume dealers. As a result, our close rates fell in the fourth quarter of 2015, and we were unable to generate unit growth commensurate with the growth in traffic. To increase growth rates, we intend to: (i) increase\nthe rate at which visitors to our website and our affinity group marketing partner sites, and users of our mobile applications, obtain a Guaranteed Savings Certificate by investing in delivering a better experience to consumers and dealers; and (ii) improve close rates by investing in additional dealer support personnel. By doing so, we will be re-allocating dollars from marketing and advertising, which in the past has driven revenue growth, to make investments in our dealer, product, technology, and research efforts in order to make the changes that will improve the consumer and dealer experiences and drive revenue growth in the future.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in our revenues of $72.7 million for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily reflected the substantial increase in our transaction revenue. Transaction revenue and forecasts, consulting and other revenue comprised 91.6% and 8.4%, respectively, of revenues for 2014 as compared to 88.6% and 11.4%, respectively, for 2013. The increase in transaction revenue for 2014 primarily reflected the 52.7% increase in units due to the level of marketing spend and the increase in the number of Certified TrueCar Dealers, platform and product enhancements, and the overall growth in sales of the automotive industry. Our average monthly unique visitors grew 54.5% to 4.3 million during 2014 from 2.8 million during 2013, reflecting our increased advertising expenses which improved brand awareness and the visibility of our car buying services to our users. Our monetization increased 4.4% to $310 during 2014 from $297 for 2013, and primarily reflected improved pricing with our TrueCar Certified Dealers and lower sales credits charged against revenue resulting from improved collection efforts. The 13.5% increase in forecasts, consulting, and other for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily reflected improved pricing of our renewal forecasts and consulting service contracts and lead referral fees.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cost of revenue of $6.1 million or 35.1% for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $4.4 million increase in data costs and licensing fees to support the growth of our business and a $1.1 million increase in employee related costs primarily due to increases in headcount. Although we expect our cost of revenue to increase in dollar amount as we add additional data sources in the near term, we believe that the nature of our cost structure will enable us to realize operating leverage in our business over time.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013.

The decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues during 2014 from 2013 reflected operating leverage due to our increased level of transaction revenues during 2014 as compared to the prior year.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>58.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in sales and marketing expenses of $22.4 million or 17.4% for 2015 as compared to 2014 reflected a $19.3 million increase in advertising and promotional activities primarily due to increased television, radio and online marketing spend, and a $3.4 million increase in affinity partner marketing fees as a result of our increased level of unit sales and increased promotional activities, such as loan subvention, where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of customers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners to incentivize their customers to use our platform. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2015 also reflected a $7.2 million increase in salaries and related expenses primarily due to our increased headcount. These increases in sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by a decrease of $5.1 million in warrant expense related to warrants issued to a\nthird-party marketing firm and a service provider and a decrease of $1.9 million in consulting fees as we have brought some services in-house that were previously performed by third parties. Although we plan to re-allocate a portion of our sales and marketing expenditures from advertising to make investments in improving our dealer relationships, we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in total due to increased headcount to better serve our existing dealers as well as television and radio advertising, digital customer acquisition costs, affinity group marketing partner fees, and other marketing programs as we grow our business.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in sales and marketing expenses of $53.4 million or 71.0% for 2014 as compared to 2013 reflected a $35.9 million increase in advertising and promotional activities primarily due to increased television, radio and online marketing spend to grow the TrueCar.com brand, and a $13.1 million increase in affinity partner marketing fees as a result of our increased level of unit sales and increased promotional activities, such as loan subvention, where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of customers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners to incentivize their customers to use our platform.

Since inception, our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sales of shares of our capital stock and proceeds from the issuance of indebtedness.\nWe have incurred cumulative losses of $275.9 million from our operations through December 31, 2015, and expect to incur additional losses in the future. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the timing and extent of our spending to support our technology and development efforts. To the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents, and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\nCredit Facility\nWe previously entered into a credit facility with a financial institution that provided for advances under a formula-based revolving line of credit and had no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2015.\nOn February 18, 2015, we amended our credit facility to provide advances of up to $35.0 million. This amended credit facility provides a $10.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit and contains an increase option permitting us, subject to the lenders consent, to increase the revolving credit facility by up to $15.0 million, to an aggregate maximum of $50 million. The credit facility has a three-year term and matures on February 18, 2018. See Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements herein for more information about our amended credit facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Cash Flow Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,369\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,911\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(29,836\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,823\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,483\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>6,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur net loss and cash flows used in operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support our growth, and marketing, advertising and sponsorship expenses. Our net loss has been significantly greater than cash used in or provided by operating activities due to the inclusion of non-cash expenses and charges.\nCash used in operating activities in 2015 was $11.4 million. This was primarily due to our net loss of $64.9 million, which, adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $17.3 million, stock-based compensation expense of $42.6 million, and loss on disposal of fixed assets of $1.6 million, resulted in $2.7 million in cash used in operations. This use of cash was also due to $8.6 million in changes to operating assets and liabilities, which primarily reflected a decrease of $6.5 million in accrued employee expenses primarily related to lower accrued bonuses, an increase of $5.9 million in accounts receivable primarily related to increased revenues, a decrease of $1.8 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to decreased marketing fees. These were partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to increased affinity group marketing fees and growth in our business and a decrease of $1.1 million in other current assets primarily due to a decrease in a receivable from a legal settlement in our favor.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2014 was $3.1 million. This was primarily due to our net loss of $48.4 million, which, adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $13.0 million, stock-based compensation expense of $29.3 million, common stock warrant expense of $9.9 million, and other non-cash adjustments of $1.3 million, resulted in $5.1 million in cash provided by operations. This was offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in changes to operating assets and liabilities, which reflected a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $4.3 million, primarily related to increases in accrued marketing expenses, legal costs, and construction costs; a decrease in accrued employee expenses of $3.9 million related to increased accrued bonuses driven by growth in headcount; and a decrease in accounts payable of $3.4 million, primarily related to affinity group marketing fees. These were partially offset by a $10.4 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of our increased revenues, $1.7 million increase in prepaid expenses related to media production, insurance, and software costs, and a $1.3 million increase in other assets related to amounts receivable from a legal settlement in our favor.\nCash used in operating activities in 2013 was $3.9 million, primarily as a result of our net loss of $25.1 million and a $6.7 million use of cash as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, which was largely offset by $27.9 million of non-cash operating expenses. The $6.7 million use of cash as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities reflected an $8.2 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of our increased revenues, a $2.0 million increase in prepaid expenses primarily associated with our increased media advertising spend, a decrease of $1.2 million in accrued expenses primarily associated with the modification of the marketing arrangement with Yahoo! in 2012, partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in accrued employee expenses due to an increase in accrued bonuses driven by our improved financial results, and a $1.4 million increase in accounts payable associated with the growth in our business.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for capitalized software development costs and property and equipment and changes in restricted cash requirements associated with our modified marketing arrangement with Yahoo!.\nCash used in investing activities of $29.8 million for 2015 resulted primarily from $13.8 million of investments in software, $12.7 million of investments in furniture, leasehold, and facility improvements primarily associated with our San Francisco and Santa Monica office spaces, and $3.3 million of investment in computer hardware.\nCash used in investing activities of $9.8 million for 2014 primarily resulted from investments in capitalized software development and property and equipment of $15.5 million and a purchase of $0.4 million related to the True.com domain name, which was partially offset by $4.1 million of repayments on notes receivable from related parties and the release of $2.0 million of restricted cash under our modified marketing arrangement with Yahoo!.\nCash used in investing activities of $5.5 million in 2013 primarily resulted from the investment in capitalized software development and property and equipment of $8.4 million which was partially offset by the release of $2.5 million in restricted cash under our modified marketing arrangement with Yahoo!, and $0.4 million of payments on notes receivable from related parties.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities of $6.0 million for 2015 primarily reflects $5.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards, and a $0.6 million tenant improvement reimbursement related to a build-to-suit capitalized lease.\nCash provided by financing activities of $110.4 million for 2014 reflects $69.7 million of proceeds from our initial public offering, $30.9 million of proceeds from our follow-on offering, approximately $9.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants, $5.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards, and $5.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility, which was partially offset by repayment of $10.0 million under our credit facility.\nCash provided by financing activities of $31.2 million in 2013 reflects net proceeds of $29.9 million from the issuance of 2,857,143 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in a private placement, and $5.0 million from a draw down under our Credit Facility. These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million repurchase of vested option awards pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into with a former executive, a $1.0 million repurchase of outstanding common stock pursuant to an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, $0.6 million for payments of costs related to our initial public offering, and $0.4 million of payments of contingent consideration related to the Carperks acquisition. The remaining contingent consideration related to the Carperks acquisition of $1.9 million was paid in 2014. Of this total, $0.4 million was part of the estimated purchase price and has been classified as a financing cash out flow. The additional $1.5 million has been classified as an operating cash outflow.\nContractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nSet forth below is information concerning our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 that are fixed and determinable.\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>5,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur lease obligations consist of various leases for office space. We also have purchase obligations for data information, software related licenses and support services. For further discussion, see Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements included herein. Contingent obligations arising from unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the contractual obligations because it is expected that the unrecognized benefits would only result in an insignificant amount of cash payments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, as part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows are not subject to off-balance sheet risks.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions on an ongoing basis and that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, sales allowances and allowances for doubtful accounts, the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, the recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets, the expensing and capitalization of software and website development costs, and the valuation and assumptions underlying stock-based compensation and other equity instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The fees are fixed or determinable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Deferred revenue is recognized on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets when payments are received in advance of us meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria described above.\nTransaction Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for fee arrangements based on a per vehicle basis when the vehicle sale has occurred between the automotive buying website program user and dealer. Under the contractual terms and conditions with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers, the dealer is required to pay us upon the sale of a vehicle to a user that has been provided to the dealer by us. Revenue recognition is not contingent on verification or acceptance of the transaction by the dealer.\nUpon a user deciding to proceed with the user's vehicle purchase through us, the user provides his or her name, address, e-mail, and phone number during the process of obtaining a Guaranteed Savings Certificate, which gives us the identity and source of a TrueCar lead provided to a specific dealer prior to an actual sale occurring. After a sale occurs, we receive real-time information regarding the sale, including the identity of the purchaser, via the Dealer Management System, DMS\u201d, used by the dealer that made the sale. To the extent that a sale is not matched via comparison of user information we have to sale information provided by the DMS, we also establish matches via one or more of the over 20 different data feeds provided to the Company by third party data aggregators, loan and insurance files provided by our affinity group marketing partners and other publicly available sources. This process often results in overlapping sales matches between the DMS and multiple data feeds, resulting in a high degree of certainty with respect to our ability to identify user leads that we provide to the dealers. This data is also used to invoice dealers shortly after the completion of the sales transactions. As a result of the various data sources available to us, it is unusual for us to have difficulty in reconciling introductions provided to our network of dealers to actual vehicle sales under our platform.\nRevenue is recognized net of estimated sales allowances. We establish sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on our history of adjustments and credits provided to our TrueCar Certified Dealers. Sales allowances relate primarily to credits issued where a dealer claims that an introduction was previously identified by the dealer from a source other than us. While the dealer is contractually obligated to pay the invoice, we may issue a credit against the invoice to maintain overall dealer relations. In assessing\nthe adequacy of the sales allowance, we evaluate our history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the financial statements. While estimated sales adjustments and credits and ultimate losses may vary from actual results, and could be material to the financial statements, actual sales allowances have been materially consistent with our estimates.\nWe also recognize revenue from dealers under subscription arrangements. Subscription fee arrangements are short-term in nature with terms ranging from one to six months and are cancellable by the dealer or us at any time. Subscription arrangements fall into three types: flat rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales ( guaranteed sales\u201d) and subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions ( guaranteed introductions\u201d). Under flat rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of sales made to users of our platform by the dealer. For flat rate subscription arrangements, we recognize the fees as revenue over the subscription period on a straight line basis which corresponds to the period that we are providing the dealer with access to our platform. Under guaranteed sales subscription arrangements fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. Under guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees. For guaranteed sales and guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, we recognize revenue based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of sales generated or introductions delivered through our platform during the subscription period multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction or (ii) the guaranteed number of sales or introductions multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction.\nIn addition, some automobile manufacturers promote the sale of their vehicles through the offering of additional consumer incentives to members of our affinity group marketing partners. These manufacturers pay a per-vehicle fee to us for promotion of the incentive and we recognize as revenue the per-vehicle incentive fee at the time the sale of the vehicle has occurred between the Automotive Website Program user and the dealer.\nForecasts, Consulting and Other Revenue\nWe also derive revenue from providing forecasts, consulting and other services to the automotive and financial services industries. Additional revenue sources include lead referral fees, advertising fees earned from display advertisements on the TrueCar.com website, and data licensing fees earned for licensing certain proprietary data to third parties. We generally recognize revenue upon delivery of such services.\nSales of forecasts, consulting and other services may include multiple deliverables including sale of lease residual data, guidebooks and consulting services. We therefore recognize revenues for these arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25\u201d). ASC 605-25 was updated by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2009-13\u201d).\nFor multiple deliverable revenue arrangements, we first assess whether each deliverable has value to the customer on a standalone basis and performance is considered probable and substantially in our control. Forecasts and consulting services are sold both on a standalone basis and as part of multiple deliverable arrangements. Accordingly, the services have standalone value to the customer. Based on that standalone value of the deliverables, we allocate our revenues among the separate deliverables in the arrangement using the relative selling price method hierarchy established in ASU 2009-13. This hierarchy requires the selling price of each deliverable in a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement to be based on, in descending order: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, (ii) third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE, or (iii) management's best estimated selling price, or BESP.\nWe have not established VSOE or TPE for our forecasts, consulting and other services because the deliverables are not sold separately within a sufficiently narrow price range or third party pricing for comparable services is not available; therefore, we apply judgment to determine BESP. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The determination of BESP requires us to make significant estimates and judgments and we consider numerous factors in this determination, including the nature of the deliverables, market conditions and our competitive landscape, internal costs, and our pricing and discounting practices associated with actual transactions. We update our estimates of BESP on a periodic basis as events and as circumstances may require.\nRevenue from the sale of lease residual value data and guidebooks is recognized in the period that the data or report is delivered. Revenue in connection with consulting services is recognized in the period the report is completed and delivered to the customer.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts\nWe determine our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical write-off experience and when specific circumstances make it likely that recovery will not occur. We review the allowance for doubtful accounts periodically and assesses the aging of account balances, with an emphasis on those that are past due over ninety days. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for an acquisition and allocate the purchase price to the respective net tangible and intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows and discount rates. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in arriving at fair value measurements in connection with fair values of assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nTransaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred, and are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in our business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nWe have the option to assess goodwill for possible impairment by performing a qualitative analysis to determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or perform the first step in an impairment test.\nThe first step (\"Step 1\") involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then the second step is to compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value. The estimate of implied fair value of goodwill may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nWe test for goodwill impairment annually at December 31. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no impairment charges recorded on our goodwill. We elected to conduct a quantitative goodwill assessment of our reporting units at December 31, 2015. The fair value of the reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying value and accordingly, we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment and intangible assets resulting from business combinations, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured first by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. When measuring the recoverability of these assets, we make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to impair these assets. We have not recognized any impairment of long-lived assets to date.\nSoftware and Website Development Costs\nCosts incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages of development and maintenance of our platform are expensed as incurred. Certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a new product or projects to provide significant additional functionality to existing products are capitalized if certain criteria are met. Maintenance and enhancement costs are typically expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are estimated to be three years. Amortization expense is included in depreciation and amortization in the statements of comprehensive loss.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted to our employees, consultants and other service providers that can be settled in shares of our common stock. We estimate the grant date fair value of option grants, and the resulting stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, we use the market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant to determine the fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation for employee awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite period, except for performance-based awards, which are recognized using the graded-vesting model. As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, such expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nDetermining the fair value of awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock, which are key inputs in the determination of the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the options;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected term. We use the simplified method under the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate expected term for plain vanilla share options. For performance-based option awards and out-of-the money option grants, we determine the expected term based upon historical exercise and post-vesting cancellations, adjusted for expected future exercise behavior;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected volatility.

When making the selections of our comparable industry peers to be used in the volatility calculation, we considered the size, operational and economic similarities to our principal business operations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Dividend yield. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based upon an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms, and forfeiture rates utilized for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate assumptions, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nAt December 31, 2015 total remaining stock-based compensation expense for unvested awards was $56.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.13 years.\nPrior to the date our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the fair value of our common stock had been approved by the board of directors at each grant date based on a variety of factors, including periodic valuations of our common stock, our financial position, historical financial performance, projected financial performance, valuations of publicly traded peer companies arm's-length sales of our common stock, and the illiquid nature of common stock. Since our initial public offering, we\ndetermine the fair value of our common stock based on the closing price as quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select Market of our common stock on the grant date.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the year that includes the enactment date. We determine deferred tax assets including net operating losses and liabilities, based on temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We have a full valuation allowance, and have concluded, based on the weight of all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized, primarily due to our historical net operating losses.\nWe utilize a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Step one, recognition, requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, no benefits of the position are recognized. If we determine that a position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, then we proceed to step two, measurement, which is based on the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized on effective settlement. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. If actual results differ from our estimates, our net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be materially impacted.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.", "item_7_truncated": "\nCash provided by financing activities of $6.0 million for 2015 primarily reflects $5.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards, and a $0.6 million tenant improvement reimbursement related to a build-to-suit capitalized lease.\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>241,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Forecasts, consulting and other revenue\n</td> <td>18,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>259,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe test for goodwill impairment annually at December 31.

Forecasts and consulting services are sold both on a standalone basis and as part of multiple deliverable arrangements. Accordingly, the services have standalone value to the customer. Based on that standalone value of the deliverables, we allocate our revenues among the separate deliverables in the arrangement using the relative selling price method hierarchy established in ASU 2009-13. This hierarchy requires the selling price of each deliverable in a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement to be based on, in descending order: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, (ii) third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE, or (iii) management's best estimated selling price, or BESP.\nItem 7.

The increase in transaction revenue for 2014 primarily reflected the 52.7% increase in units due to the level of marketing spend and the increase in the number of Certified TrueCar Dealers, platform and product enhancements, and the overall growth in sales of the automotive industry. Our average monthly unique visitors grew 54.5% to 4.3 million during 2014 from 2.8 million during 2013, reflecting our increased advertising expenses which improved brand awareness and the visibility of our car buying services to our users. Our monetization increased 4.4% to $310 during 2014 from $297 for 2013, and primarily reflected improved pricing with our TrueCar Certified Dealers and lower sales credits charged against revenue resulting from improved collection efforts. The 13.5% increase in forecasts, consulting, and other for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily reflected improved pricing of our renewal forecasts and consulting service contracts and lead referral fees.\nThe number of average monthly unique visitors increased 39.6% to approximately 6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from approximately 4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. We attribute the growth in our average monthly unique visitors principally to increased television and digital marketing advertising campaigns that have led to increased brand awareness, as well as increased traffic from our affinity group marketing partners.\n (5) Represents lease termination costs associated with the consolidation of the Company's office locations in Santa Monica, California.

The increase in cost of revenue of $2.2 million or 14.5% for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in data costs and licensing fees to support the growth of our business and a $0.7 million increase in employee related costs primarily due to increases in headcount partially offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in consulting costs. The decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues during 2014 from 2013 reflected operating leverage due to our increased level of transaction revenues during 2014 as compared to the prior year.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (3) Represents a non-recurring legal settlement in favor of the Company. We believe excluding the impact of this non-recurring legal settlement is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons. \nWe benefit consumers by providing information related to what others have paid for a make and model of car in their area and, where available, estimated prices for that make and model, which we refer to as upfront pricing information, from our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. This upfront pricing information generally includes guaranteed savings off MSRP which the consumer may then take to the dealer in the form of a Guaranteed Savings Certificate and apply toward the purchase of the specified make and model of car. We benefit our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers by enabling them to attract these informed, in-market consumers in a cost-effective, accountable manner, which we believe helps them to sell more cars profitably. We benefit OEMs by allowing them to more effectively target their incentive spending at deep-in-market consumers during their purchase process.\nthe rate at which visitors to our website and our affinity group marketing partner sites, and users of our mobile applications, obtain a Guaranteed Savings Certificate by investing in delivering a better experience to consumers and dealers; and (ii) improve close rates by investing in additional dealer support personnel. By doing so, we will be re-allocating dollars from marketing and advertising, which in the past has driven revenue growth, to make investments in our dealer, product, technology, and research efforts in order to make the changes that will improve the consumer and dealer experiences and drive revenue growth in the future.\nWe utilize a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Step one, recognition, requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, no benefits of the position are recognized. If we determine that a position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, then we proceed to step two, measurement, which is based on the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized on effective settlement. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. If actual results differ from our estimates, our net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be materially impacted.\nAverage Monthly Unique Visitors\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation of $10.7 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the departure of certain executives. \nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in interest expense of $1.6 million or 80.9% for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily reflected a decrease in interest on our convertible debt and a decrease in the accretion of debt discount resulting from a beneficial conversion feature on our convertible debt, which converted to equity in May 2013.\nComponents of Operating Results\nWe define a monthly unique visitor as an individual who has visited our website, our landing page on our affinity group marketing partner sites, or our mobile applications within a calendar month. We identify unique visitors through cookies for browser-based visits on either a desktop computer or mobile device and through device IDs for mobile application visits. In addition, if a TrueCar.com user logs-in, we supplement their identification with their log-in credentials to attempt to avoid double counting on TrueCar.com across devices, browsers and mobile applications. If an individual accesses our service using different devices or different browsers on the same device within a given month, the first access through each such device or browser is counted as a separate monthly unique visitor, except where adjusted based upon TrueCar.com log-in information. We calculate average monthly unique visitors as the sum of the monthly unique visitors in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We view our average monthly unique visitors as a key indicator of the growth in our business and audience reach, the strength of our brand, and the visibility of car buying services to the member base of our affinity group marketing partners.\nOur TrueCar Certified Dealer network includes non-franchised dealers that primarily sell used cars and are not included in franchise dealer count. Our franchise dealer count increased to 9,094 at December 31, 2015 from 8,501 at December 31, 2014 and 6,651 at December 31, 2013. A disproportionate number of the net franchise dealer additions in the second half of 2015 represented relatively lower unit volume dealers. We intend to increase the number of dealers representing high volume brands in our dealer network generally, and in key geographies, by investing to improve the dealer experience and increasing dealer satisfaction.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for an acquisition and allocate the purchase price to the respective net tangible and intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows and discount rates. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in arriving at fair value measurements in connection with fair values of assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest on our built-to-suit lease financing obligation, on our outstanding short-term debt obligations, and for the period from May 2012 to May 2013, accretion of debt discount resulting from a beneficial conversion feature on our convertible debt, which converted to equity in May 2013. In addition, beginning in August 2013, interest expense includes interest on our credit facility and the amortization of the discount on our line of credit. See Notes 5 and 6 of our consolidated financial statements included herein for more information about our debt obligations.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cost of revenue of $6.1 million or 35.1% for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $4.4 million increase in data costs and licensing fees to support the growth of our business and a $1.1 million increase in employee related costs primarily due to increases in headcount. Although we expect our cost of revenue to increase in dollar amount as we add additional data sources in the near term, we believe that the nature of our cost structure will enable us to realize operating leverage in our business over time.\nCredit Facility\nRevenue from the sale of lease residual value data and guidebooks is recognized in the period that the data or report is delivered. Revenue in connection with consulting services is recognized in the period the report is completed and delivered to the customer.\n\nRevenues\nRevenue Recognition\nSales of forecasts, consulting and other services may include multiple deliverables including sale of lease residual data, guidebooks and consulting services. We therefore recognize revenues for these arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25\u201d). ASC 605-25 was updated by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2009-13\u201d).\nProvision for Income Taxes\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $27.4 million or 88.9% for 2014 as compared to 2013 reflected $14.2 million in increased stock-based compensation due to additional stock-based awards, $7.6 million in increased salaries and related expenses due to our increased headcount, and $2.8 million in increased professional fees, comprised primarily of $2.3 million in legal fees related to a claim we filed against Sonic Automotive Holdings, Inc. ( Sonic\u201d). The remaining increase related to a $2.0 million liquidity bonus paid to an executive in connection with our IPO and $0.6 million increased insurance costs.\n (1) We issued full credits of the amount originally invoiced with respect to 12,484, 8,779, and 17,664 units during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The number of units has not been adjusted downwards related to units credited as discussed in the description of the unit metric below. \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included herein. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere herein. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nForecasts, Consulting and Other Revenue\n \n\nOur mission is to deliver the best car-buying experience for consumers and provide dealers and automakers with an excellent return on their marketing dollars. We have established an intelligent, data-driven online platform operating on a common technology infrastructure, powered by proprietary data and analytics. We operate our company-branded platform on the TrueCar website and our branded mobile experience. In addition, we customize and operate our platform on a co-branded basis for our many affinity group marketing partners, including financial institutions like USAA and American Express, membership-based organizations like Consumer Reports, AARP, Sam's Club, and AAA, and employee buying programs for large enterprises such as IBM and Walmart. We enable users to obtain market-based pricing data on new and used cars, and to connect with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We also allow automobile manufacturers, known in the industry as OEMs, to connect with TrueCar users in the purchase process and efficiently deliver targeted incentives to consumers.\n\n \u2022 Expected term. We use the simplified method under the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate expected term for plain vanilla share options. For performance-based option awards and out-of-the money option grants, we determine the expected term based upon historical exercise and post-vesting cancellations, adjusted for expected future exercise behavior; \nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in technology and development expenses of $11.5 million or 31.3% for 2015 as compared to 2014 reflected an increase of $10.6 million in increased salaries and related expenses due to our increased headcount, a $1.6 million increase in software license and hosting expenses, a $1.4 million increase in overhead related to facilities, reflecting extra space needed to accommodate increased headcount, and a $1.2 million increase in write-offs of capitalized software that we determined not to place in service. These increases were partially offset by a $2.8 million increase in the amount of salaries capitalized for the development of internal use software costs which reduced technology and development expenses during the period. Capitalized software costs increased $1.8 million for 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in the amount of salaries capitalized for the development of internal use software of $2.8 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in capitalized third-party software costs of $1.0 million. We expect our technology and development expenses to increase in dollar amount as we continue to increase our developer headcount to upgrade and enhance our technology infrastructure, invest in our products, expand the functionality of our platform and provide new product offerings. We also expect technology and development expenses to continue to be affected by variations in the amount of capitalized internally developed software.\n (3) Represents a non-recurring legal settlement in favor of the Company. We believe excluding the impact of this non-recurring legal settlement is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons. \n \u2022 Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. \nCash used in investing activities of $9.8 million for 2014 primarily resulted from investments in capitalized software development and property and equipment of $15.5 million and a purchase of $0.4 million related to the True.com domain name, which was partially offset by $4.1 million of repayments on notes receivable from related parties and the release of $2.0 million of restricted cash under our modified marketing arrangement with Yahoo!.\nUpon a user deciding to proceed with the user's vehicle purchase through us, the user provides his or her name, address, e-mail, and phone number during the process of obtaining a Guaranteed Savings Certificate, which gives us the identity and source of a TrueCar lead provided to a specific dealer prior to an actual sale occurring. After a sale occurs, we receive real-time information regarding the sale, including the identity of the purchaser, via the Dealer Management System, DMS\u201d, used by the dealer that made the sale. To the extent that a sale is not matched via comparison of user information we have to sale information provided by the DMS, we also establish matches via one or more of the over 20 different data feeds provided to the Company by third party data aggregators, loan and insurance files provided by our affinity group marketing partners and other publicly available sources. This process often results in overlapping sales matches between the DMS and multiple data feeds, resulting in a high degree of certainty with respect to our ability to identify user leads that we provide to the dealers. This data is also used to invoice dealers shortly after the completion of the sales transactions. As a result of the various data sources available to us, it is unusual for us to have difficulty in reconciling introductions provided to our network of dealers to actual vehicle sales under our platform.\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the year that includes the enactment date. We determine deferred tax assets including net operating losses and liabilities, based on temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We have a full valuation allowance, and have concluded, based on the weight of all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized, primarily due to our historical net operating losses.\nFranchise Dealer Count\nSales and Marketing Expenses\n (6) Non-GAAP net income (loss) is not a measure of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For a definition of Non-GAAP net income (loss) see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d \nContractual Obligations\nOn February 18, 2015, we amended our credit facility to provide advances of up to $35.0 million. This amended credit facility provides a $10.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit and contains an increase option permitting us, subject to the lenders consent, to increase the revolving credit facility by up to $15.0 million, to an aggregate maximum of $50 million. The credit facility has a three-year term and matures on February 18, 2018. See Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements herein for more information about our amended credit facility.\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions on an ongoing basis and that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nCash provided by financing activities of $110.4 million for 2014 reflects $69.7 million of proceeds from our initial public offering, $30.9 million of proceeds from our follow-on offering, approximately $9.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants, $5.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards, and $5.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility, which was partially offset by repayment of $10.0 million under our credit facility.\n\n\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods indicated.\n \u2022 Expected volatility. As we do not have a significant trading history for our common stock, expected volatility is derived from the historical stock volatilities of several comparable publicly listed peers over a period approximately equal to the expected term of the options. When making the selections of our comparable industry peers to be used in the volatility calculation, we considered the size, operational and economic similarities to our principal business operations; and \n (1) Includes stock-based compensation of $10.7 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the departure of certain executives. \nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest expense of $0.1 million or 16.6% for 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflect the interest expense incurred on our lease financing obligation in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in the interest on our outstanding balance of our short-term borrowings in 2014.\nSoftware and Website Development Costs\nthird-party marketing firm and a service provider and a decrease of $1.9 million in consulting fees as we have brought some services in-house that were previously performed by third parties. Although we plan to re-allocate a portion of our sales and marketing expenditures from advertising to make investments in improving our dealer relationships, we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in total due to increased headcount to better serve our existing dealers as well as television and radio advertising, digital customer acquisition costs, affinity group marketing partner fees, and other marketing programs as we grow our business.\nCosts incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages of development and maintenance of our platform are expensed as incurred. Certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a new product or projects to provide significant additional functionality to existing products are capitalized if certain criteria are met. Maintenance and enhancement costs are typically expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are estimated to be three years. Amortization expense is included in depreciation and amortization in the statements of comprehensive loss.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment and intangible assets resulting from business combinations, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured first by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. When measuring the recoverability of these assets, we make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to impair these assets. We have not recognized any impairment of long-lived assets to date.\nOverview\nWe have not established VSOE or TPE for our forecasts, consulting and other services because the deliverables are not sold separately within a sufficiently narrow price range or third party pricing for comparable services is not available; therefore, we apply judgment to determine BESP. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The determination of BESP requires us to make significant estimates and judgments and we consider numerous factors in this determination, including the nature of the deliverables, market conditions and our competitive landscape, internal costs, and our pricing and discounting practices associated with actual transactions. We update our estimates of BESP on a periodic basis as events and as circumstances may require.\n\nTransaction Revenue. Revenue consists of fees paid by dealers participating in our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. Dealers pay us these fees either on a per vehicle basis for sales to our users or in the form of a subscription arrangement. Subscription arrangements fall into three types: flat rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales ( guaranteed sales\u201d) and subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions ( guaranteed introductions\u201d). Under flat rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of sales made to users of our platform by the dealer. For flat rate subscription arrangements, we recognize the fees as revenue over the subscription period on a straight line basis which corresponds to the period that we are providing the dealer with access to our platform. Under guaranteed sales subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. Under guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees. For guaranteed sales and guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, we recognize revenue based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of sales generated or introductions delivered through our platform during the subscription period multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction or (ii) the guaranteed number of sales or introductions multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction.\nThe number of units increased 22.8% to 750,108 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 610,620 for the year ended December 31, 2014. We attribute this growth in units to the effectiveness of our increased marketing activities, product enhancements, the growing number and geographic coverage of TrueCar Certified Dealers in our network, and the overall growth in new car sales in the automotive industry.\nTransaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred, and are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.\nTechnology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance and stock-based compensation expenses, third-party contractor fees, and allocated overhead primarily associated with development of our platform, as well as our product development, product management, research and analytics and internal IT functions.\nThe first step (\"Step 1\") involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then the second step is to compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value. The estimate of implied fair value of goodwill may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\n\n (4) We incurred severance costs of $0.6 million and $2.8 million for executive-level employees who terminated during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, we also incurred $0.3 million of related recruiting fees for the placement of our new CEO in the fourth quarter of 2015. We believe excluding the impact of these costs from 2015 is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of ongoing operating results. \ndetermine the fair value of our common stock based on the closing price as quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select Market of our common stock on the grant date.\nContractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in our business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $4.4 million or 33.6% for 2015 as compared to 2014 reflected a growth in capitalized software costs and higher investments in property and equipment. We expect our depreciation and amortization expenses to continue to be affected by the amount of capitalized internally developed software costs, property and equipment and the timing of placing projects in service. Further, as we invest in and upgrade our technology infrastructure, depending on the timing of these upgrades, we may shorten the useful lives of some of our existing assets and accelerate related amortization expense.\nDuring the second half of 2015, we experienced a decline in the proportion of dealers representing high volume brands in our network and slowed quarter over quarter revenue growth. A disproportionate number of the net franchise dealer additions in the second half of 2015 represented relatively lower unit volume dealers. As a result, our close rates fell in the fourth quarter of 2015, and we were unable to generate unit growth commensurate with the growth in traffic. To increase growth rates, we intend to: (i) increase\nWe also derive revenue from providing forecasts, consulting and other services to the automotive and financial services industries. Additional revenue sources include lead referral fees, advertising fees earned from display advertisements on the TrueCar.com website, and data licensing fees earned for licensing certain proprietary data to third parties. We generally recognize revenue upon delivery of such services.\nWe define transaction revenue per franchise dealer as the aggregate transaction revenue we receive in a given period divided by the average franchise dealer count in that period. We calculate average franchise dealer count in a given period as the average of the franchise dealer count at the beginning of the period and the franchise dealer count at the end of the period. Our transaction revenue per franchise dealer increased 9.8% to $27,439 during the year ended December 31, 2015 from $24,994 for the year ended December 31, 2014. These increases primarily reflect an increase in units which was attributable to an increase in marketing spend and an increase in the number of TrueCar Certified Dealers, platform and product enhancements, and the overall growth in sales of the automotive industry.\n\nRevenues\nOur lease obligations consist of various leases for office space. We also have purchase obligations for data information, software related licenses and support services. For further discussion, see Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements included herein. Contingent obligations arising from unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the contractual obligations because it is expected that the unrecognized benefits would only result in an insignificant amount of cash payments.\nQuarterly Key Metrics and Results of Operations\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met:\nCash provided by financing activities of $31.2 million in 2013 reflects net proceeds of $29.9 million from the issuance of 2,857,143 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in a private placement, and $5.0 million from a draw down under our Credit Facility. These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million repurchase of vested option awards pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into with a former executive, a $1.0 million repurchase of outstanding common stock pursuant to an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, $0.6 million for payments of costs related to our initial public offering, and $0.4 million of payments of contingent consideration related to the Carperks acquisition. The remaining contingent consideration related to the Carperks acquisition of $1.9 million was paid in 2014. Of this total, $0.4 million was part of the estimated purchase price and has been classified as a financing cash out flow. The additional $1.5 million has been classified as an operating cash outflow.\nYears ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Our provision for income taxes for 2015 2014, and 2013 primarily reflected tax expense due to amortization of tax deductible goodwill that is not an available source of income to realize our deferred tax assets.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.6 million or 14.2% for 2014 as compared to 2013 reflected a growth in capitalized software costs and higher investments in property and equipment.\n \u2022 Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. \nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in sales and marketing expenses of $53.4 million or 71.0% for 2014 as compared to 2013 reflected a $35.9 million increase in advertising and promotional activities primarily due to increased television, radio and online marketing spend to grow the TrueCar.com brand, and a $13.1 million increase in affinity partner marketing fees as a result of our increased level of unit sales and increased promotional activities, such as loan subvention, where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of customers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners to incentivize their customers to use our platform. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2014 also reflected a $4.9 million increase in salaries and related expenses primarily due to our increased headcount, an increase of $2.2 million in stock-based compensation due to additional stock-based awards, an increase of $1.6 million in warrant expense related to warrants issued to our third-party marketing firm and service provider, a $0.8 million increase associated with the purchase of our ticker symbol TRUE\u201d, and an increase of $0.6 million associated with a liquidity bonus paid to a sales executive in connection with our IPO. These increases in sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by a decrease of $5.6 million in our corporate sponsorship expense as a result of terminating certain sponsorship agreements that we determined to be ineffective.\nInterest Expense\n\n (4) We incurred severance costs of $0.6 million and $2.8 million for executive-level employees who terminated during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, we also incurred $0.3 million of related recruiting fees for the placement of our new CEO in the fourth quarter of 2015. We believe excluding the impact of these terminations from 2015 is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of ongoing operating results. \n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nWe also recognize revenue from dealers under subscription arrangements. Subscription fee arrangements are short-term in nature with terms ranging from one to six months and are cancellable by the dealer or us at any time. Subscription arrangements fall into three types: flat rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales ( guaranteed sales\u201d) and subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions ( guaranteed introductions\u201d). Under flat rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of sales made to users of our platform by the dealer. For flat rate subscription arrangements, we recognize the fees as revenue over the subscription period on a straight line basis which corresponds to the period that we are providing the dealer with access to our platform. Under guaranteed sales subscription arrangements fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. Under guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees. For guaranteed sales and guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, we recognize revenue based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of sales generated or introductions delivered through our platform during the subscription period multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction or (ii) the guaranteed number of sales or introductions multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\n\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nInvesting Activities\nWe define monetization as the average transaction revenue per unit, which we calculate by dividing all of our transaction revenue in a given period by the number of units in that period. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our monetization increased 3.9% to $322 from $310 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in monetization is primarily a result of improved subscription pricing optimization and growth in used vs new mix, the independent dealer channel, and in revenue from automobile manufacturers, known in the industry as OEMs. We expect our monetization to be affected in the future by changes in our pricing structure, the unit mix between new and used cars, with used cars providing higher monetization, and by the introduction of new products and services.\nFinancing Activities\n* Less than 0.5% of revenues\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make operating and strategic decisions.\nOur investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for capitalized software development costs and property and equipment and changes in restricted cash requirements associated with our modified marketing arrangement with Yahoo!.\n\nWe have accumulated federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $221.2 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $156.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nWe previously entered into a credit facility with a financial institution that provided for advances under a formula-based revolving line of credit and had no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2015.\nWe determine our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical write-off experience and when specific circumstances make it likely that recovery will not occur. We review the allowance for doubtful accounts periodically and assesses the aging of account balances, with an emphasis on those that are past due over ninety days. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Non-GAAP net (loss) income for each of the periods presented:\n\nCash used in operating activities in 2015 was $11.4 million. This was primarily due to our net loss of $64.9 million, which, adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $17.3 million, stock-based compensation expense of $42.6 million, and loss on disposal of fixed assets of $1.6 million, resulted in $2.7 million in cash used in operations. This use of cash was also due to $8.6 million in changes to operating assets and liabilities, which primarily reflected a decrease of $6.5 million in accrued employee expenses primarily related to lower accrued bonuses, an increase of $5.9 million in accounts receivable primarily related to increased revenues, a decrease of $1.8 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to decreased marketing fees. These were partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to increased affinity group marketing fees and growth in our business and a decrease of $1.1 million in other current assets primarily due to a decrease in a receivable from a legal settlement in our favor.\n (2) Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) are not measures of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss), see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nTransaction Revenue\n (6) Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d \nCash used in investing activities of $29.8 million for 2015 resulted primarily from $13.8 million of investments in software, $12.7 million of investments in furniture, leasehold, and facility improvements primarily associated with our San Francisco and Santa Monica office spaces, and $3.3 million of investment in computer hardware.\nInterest Income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. General and administrative expenses increased $25.2 million or 43.2% for 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase reflected $13.9 million in increased stock-based compensation due primarily to the acceleration and modification of equity awards related to certain terminated executives of $10.7 million, additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million associated with the surrender and forfeiture of unvested options held by our former president and additional stock-based compensation of $1.1 million primarily related to awards granted in 2015. Other increases in general and administrative expenses include an increase of $5.3 million in professional fees, which includes an increase of $4.5 million in legal fees related to ongoing litigation, an increase of $3.6 million in overhead related to facilities, which includes $2.2 million in real estate exit costs associated with certain leased facilities that we exited in the fourth quarter of 2015, and an increase of $2.1 million in salaries and related expenses, primarily due to executive severance. For further discussion of executive severance, refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements contained herein. We expect to continue to incur significant legal fees related to ongoing litigation.\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2014 was $3.1 million. This was primarily due to our net loss of $48.4 million, which, adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $13.0 million, stock-based compensation expense of $29.3 million, common stock warrant expense of $9.9 million, and other non-cash adjustments of $1.3 million, resulted in $5.1 million in cash provided by operations. This was offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in changes to operating assets and liabilities, which reflected a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $4.3 million, primarily related to increases in accrued marketing expenses, legal costs, and construction costs; a decrease in accrued employee expenses of $3.9 million related to increased accrued bonuses driven by growth in headcount; and a decrease in accounts payable of $3.4 million, primarily related to affinity group marketing fees. These were partially offset by a $10.4 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of our increased revenues, $1.7 million increase in prepaid expenses related to media production, insurance, and software costs, and a $1.3 million increase in other assets related to amounts receivable from a legal settlement in our favor.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Cost of revenue includes expenses related to the fulfillment of our services, consisting primarily of data costs and licensing fees paid to third party service providers and expenses related to operating our website and mobile applications, including those associated with our data centers, hosting fees, data processing costs required to deliver introductions to our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers, employee costs related to dealer operations, sales matching, and employee and consulting costs related to delivering data and consulting services to our customers. Cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization of software costs and other hosting and data infrastructure equipment used to operate our platforms, which are included in the depreciation and amortization line item on our statement of comprehensive loss.\nWe have incurred cumulative losses of $275.9 million from our operations through December 31, 2015, and expect to incur additional losses in the future. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the timing and extent of our spending to support our technology and development efforts. To the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents, and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\n \u2022 Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.  Deferred revenue is recognized on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets when payments are received in advance of us meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria described above.\nOn occasion we issue credits to our TrueCar Certified Dealers with respect to units sold. However, we do not adjust our unit metric for these credits as we believe that in substantially all cases a vehicle has in fact been purchased through our platform given the high degree of accuracy of our sales matching process. Credits are most frequently issued to a dealer that claims it had a pre-existing relationship with a purchaser of a vehicle, and we determine whether to issue a credit based on a number of factors, including the facts and circumstances related to the dealer claim and the level of claim activity at the dealership. In most cases, we issue credits in order to maintain strong business relations with the dealer and not because we have made an erroneous sales match or billing error.\nGoodwill\nWe define franchise dealer count as the number of franchise dealers in the network of TrueCar Certified Dealers at the end of a given period. This number is calculated by counting the number of brands of new cars sold by dealers in the TrueCar Certified Dealer network at their locations, and includes both single-location proprietorships as well as large consolidated dealer groups. The network comprises dealers with a range of unit sales volume per dealer, with dealers representing certain brands consistently achieving higher than average unit sales volume. We view our ability to increase our franchise dealer count, particularly dealers representing high volume brands, as an indicator of our market penetration and the likelihood of converting users of our platform into unit sales.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. We provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 as it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result of the valuation allowance, our income tax benefit (or expense) is significantly less than the federal statutory rate of 34%. Our provision for income taxes in 2015, 2014, and 2013 primarily\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries in accordance with FASB ASC 810 - Consolidation. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nthe adequacy of the sales allowance, we evaluate our history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the financial statements. While estimated sales adjustments and credits and ultimate losses may vary from actual results, and could be material to the financial statements, actual sales allowances have been materially consistent with our estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nTechnology and Development Expenses\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in technology and development expenses of $12.9 million or 54.4% for 2014 as compared to 2013 reflected an increase of $7.9 million in increased salaries and related expenses due to our increased headcount, an increase in stock-based compensation due to additional stock-based awards of $3.9 million, a $1.8 million increase in software license and hosting expenses, and a $0.7 million increase in overhead related to facilities, reflecting extra space needed to accommodate increased headcount. These increases were partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in the amount of salaries capitalized for the development of internal use software costs which reduced technology and development expenses during the period. Capitalized software costs increased $7.1 million for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the costs for a perpetual software license of $5.0 million during 2014, an increase in the amount of salaries capitalized for the development of internal use software of $1.4 million, and increases in other third-party software costs of $0.7 million.\nWe report our financial results as one operating segment, with two distinct service offerings: transactions, and forecasts, consulting and other. Our operating results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker on a consolidated basis, principally to make decisions about how we allocate our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance. Our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews revenue for each of our transaction and data and other offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the factors driving our business.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted to our employees, consultants and other service providers that can be settled in shares of our common stock. We estimate the grant date fair value of option grants, and the resulting stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, we use the market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant to determine the fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation for employee awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite period, except for performance-based awards, which are recognized using the graded-vesting model. As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, such expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nWe recognize revenue for fee arrangements based on a per vehicle basis when the vehicle sale has occurred between the automotive buying website program user and dealer. Under the contractual terms and conditions with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers, the dealer is required to pay us upon the sale of a vehicle to a user that has been provided to the dealer by us. Revenue recognition is not contingent on verification or acceptance of the transaction by the dealer.\nUnits\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of: television and radio advertising; affinity group partner marketing fees, which also includes loan subvention costs where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of consumers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners, and common stock warrants issued to USAA; marketing sponsorship programs; and digital customer acquisition. See Part III, Item 13 Certain Relationships, Related Party and Other Transactions - Strategic Partnerships - United Services Automobile Association\u201d for a description of our arrangements with USAA. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include employee related expenses for sales, customer support, marketing and public relations employees, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses; third-party contractor fees; and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include costs related to common stock warrants issued to a third-party marketing firm and a service provider as part of our commercial arrangements with them. Marketing and advertising costs promote our services and are expensed as incurred, except for media production costs which are expensed the first time the advertisement is aired.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n \nWe do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, as part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows are not subject to off-balance sheet risks.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nPrior to the date our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the fair value of our common stock had been approved by the board of directors at each grant date based on a variety of factors, including periodic valuations of our common stock, our financial position, historical financial performance, projected financial performance, valuations of publicly traded peer companies arm's-length sales of our common stock, and the illiquid nature of common stock. Since our initial public offering, we\nOur subsidiary, ALG, Inc., provides forecasts and consulting services regarding determination of the residual value of an automobile at given future points in time. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition, financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease, and fleet portfolios. We also obtain automobile purchase data from a variety of sources and use this data to provide consumers and dealers with highly accurate, geographically specific, real-time pricing information.\nCash used in operating activities in 2013 was $3.9 million, primarily as a result of our net loss of $25.1 million and a $6.7 million use of cash as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, which was largely offset by $27.9 million of non-cash operating expenses. The $6.7 million use of cash as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities reflected an $8.2 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of our increased revenues, a $2.0 million increase in prepaid expenses primarily associated with our increased media advertising spend, a decrease of $1.2 million in accrued expenses primarily associated with the modification of the marketing arrangement with Yahoo! in 2012, partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in accrued employee expenses due to an increase in accrued bonuses driven by our improved financial results, and a $1.4 million increase in accounts payable associated with the growth in our business.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our revenues of $53.2 million or 25.7%, for 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflected the increase in our transaction revenue. Transaction revenue and forecasts, consulting and other revenue comprised 92.9% and 7.1%, respectively, of revenues for 2015 as compared to 91.6% and 8.4%, respectively, for 2014. The increase in transaction revenue for 2015 primarily reflected a 22.8% increase in units due to an increase in marketing spend and an increase in the number of TrueCar Certified Dealers, platform and product enhancements, and the overall growth in sales of the automotive industry. Our average monthly unique visitors grew 39.6% to 6.0 million during 2015 from 4.3 million during 2014, reflecting our increased advertising expenses which improved brand awareness and the visibility of our car buying services to our users. Our monetization increased 3.9% to $322 during 2015 from $310 for 2014, primarily as a result of improved subscription pricing optimization and growth in used vehicle vs. new vehicle mix, the independent dealer channel, and in revenue from OEMs. Monetization may fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in our estimated sales allowance, pricing and the unit mix between new and used cars. The 6.6% increase in forecasts, consulting and other revenue for 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflected an increase in volume of portfolio risk analyses and residual value forecasts provided to customers. We expect revenues to grow modestly in 2016.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:\n \nDetermining the fair value of awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock, which are key inputs in the determination of the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:\nOperating Activities\nAt December 31, 2015 total remaining stock-based compensation expense for unvested awards was $56.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.13 years.\n (2) The excluded amounts relate to legal costs incurred in connection with a claim we filed against Sonic Automotive Holdings, Inc., complaints filed by non-TrueCar dealers and the California New Car Dealers Association against TrueCar and securities class action lawsuits. We believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons. \nForecasts, Consulting and Other Revenue. \"Data and other revenue\" as disclosed in periods prior to 2015 is now referred to as \"forecasts, consulting and other revenue\" as we believe this description is more accurate and reflective of the actual service offerings that we provide. We derive this type of revenue primarily from the provision of forecasts and consulting services to the automotive and financial services industries through our ALG subsidiary. The forecasts and consulting services that ALG provides typically relate to the determination of the residual value of an automobile at given future points in time. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition, financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease and fleet portfolios. Our customers generally pay us for these services as information is delivered to them.\nRevenue is recognized net of estimated sales allowances. We establish sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on our history of adjustments and credits provided to our TrueCar Certified Dealers. Sales allowances relate primarily to credits issued where a dealer claims that an introduction was previously identified by the dealer from a source other than us. While the dealer is contractually obligated to pay the invoice, we may issue a credit against the invoice to maintain overall dealer relations. In assessing\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses for executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, and business intelligence personnel. General and administrative expenses also include legal, accounting, and other third-party professional service fees, bad debt, lease exit costs, and allocated overhead.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in sales and marketing expenses of $22.4 million or 17.4% for 2015 as compared to 2014 reflected a $19.3 million increase in advertising and promotional activities primarily due to increased television, radio and online marketing spend, and a $3.4 million increase in affinity partner marketing fees as a result of our increased level of unit sales and increased promotional activities, such as loan subvention, where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of customers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners to incentivize their customers to use our platform. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2015 also reflected a $7.2 million increase in salaries and related expenses primarily due to our increased headcount. These increases in sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by a decrease of $5.1 million in warrant expense related to warrants issued to a\nMonetization\nThe following tables set forth selected key metrics and unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data for each of the quarters indicated. The consolidated financial statements for each of these quarters have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the consolidated results of operations for these periods. You should read this information together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.\nOur net loss and cash flows used in operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support our growth, and marketing, advertising and sponsorship expenses. Our net loss has been significantly greater than cash used in or provided by operating activities due to the inclusion of non-cash expenses and charges.\nBusiness Combinations\nKey Metrics\nIn addition, some automobile manufacturers promote the sale of their vehicles through the offering of additional consumer incentives to members of our affinity group marketing partners. These manufacturers pay a per-vehicle fee to us for promotion of the incentive and we recognize as revenue the per-vehicle incentive fee at the time the sale of the vehicle has occurred between the Automotive Website Program user and the dealer.\n (2) The excluded amounts relate to legal costs incurred in connection with a claim we filed against Sonic Automotive Holdings, Inc., complaints filed by non-TrueCar dealers and the California New Car Dealers Association against TrueCar and securities class action lawsuits. We believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons. \n \u2022 Dividend yield. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.  In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based upon an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n (5) Represents lease termination costs associated with the consolidation of the Company's office locations in Santa Monica, California. We believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated revenues of $259.8 million and recorded a net loss of $64.9 million. Of the $259.8 million in revenues, 92.9% consisted of transaction revenues with the remaining 7.1% derived primarily from the sale of forecasts, consulting and other services to the automotive and financial services industries. Revenues from the sale of forecasts, consulting and other services are derived primarily from the operations of our ALG subsidiary. Transaction revenues primarily consist of fees paid to us by our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers under our pay-for-performance business model where we generally earn a fee only when a TrueCar user purchases a car from them.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms, and forfeiture rates utilized for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate assumptions, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nSet forth below is information concerning our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 that are fixed and determinable.\nIn addition, we enter into arrangements with automobile manufacturers to promote the sale of their vehicles through the offering of additional consumer incentives to members of our affinity group marketing partners. These manufacturers pay us a per-vehicle fee for promotion of the incentive and we recognize the per-vehicle incentive fee when the vehicle sale has occurred between the member of our affinity group marketing partner and the dealer.", "item_7_text": "\nCash provided by financing activities of $6.0 million for 2015 primarily reflects $5.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards, and a $0.6 million tenant improvement reimbursement related to a build-to-suit capitalized lease.\nWe test for goodwill impairment annually at December 31. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no impairment charges recorded on our goodwill. We elected to conduct a quantitative goodwill assessment of our reporting units at December 31, 2015. The fair value of the reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying value and accordingly, we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill.\nWe have the option to assess goodwill for possible impairment by performing a qualitative analysis to determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or perform the first step in an impairment test.\nCash Flows\nreflect a tax expense associated with the amortization of tax deductible goodwill that is not an available source of income to realize deferred tax assets.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation consists primarily of depreciation expense recorded on property and equipment. Amortization expense consists primarily of amortization recorded on intangible assets, capitalized software costs and leasehold improvements.\n (1) We issued full credits of the amount originally invoiced with respect to 3,604, 3,319, 2,802, 2,759, 2,507, 2,074, 2,054, and 2,145, units during the three months ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015, March 31, 2015, December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014, and March 31, 2014, respectively. The number of units has not been adjusted downwards related to units credited. \nFor multiple deliverable revenue arrangements, we first assess whether each deliverable has value to the customer on a standalone basis and performance is considered probable and substantially in our control. Forecasts and consulting services are sold both on a standalone basis and as part of multiple deliverable arrangements. Accordingly, the services have standalone value to the customer. Based on that standalone value of the deliverables, we allocate our revenues among the separate deliverables in the arrangement using the relative selling price method hierarchy established in ASU 2009-13. This hierarchy requires the selling price of each deliverable in a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement to be based on, in descending order: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, (ii) third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE, or (iii) management's best estimated selling price, or BESP.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPresentation of Financial Statements\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in our revenues of $72.7 million for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily reflected the substantial increase in our transaction revenue. Transaction revenue and forecasts, consulting and other revenue comprised 91.6% and 8.4%, respectively, of revenues for 2014 as compared to 88.6% and 11.4%, respectively, for 2013. The increase in transaction revenue for 2014 primarily reflected the 52.7% increase in units due to the level of marketing spend and the increase in the number of Certified TrueCar Dealers, platform and product enhancements, and the overall growth in sales of the automotive industry. Our average monthly unique visitors grew 54.5% to 4.3 million during 2014 from 2.8 million during 2013, reflecting our increased advertising expenses which improved brand awareness and the visibility of our car buying services to our users. Our monetization increased 4.4% to $310 during 2014 from $297 for 2013, and primarily reflected improved pricing with our TrueCar Certified Dealers and lower sales credits charged against revenue resulting from improved collection efforts. The 13.5% increase in forecasts, consulting, and other for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily reflected improved pricing of our renewal forecasts and consulting service contracts and lead referral fees.\nThe number of average monthly unique visitors increased 39.6% to approximately 6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from approximately 4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. We attribute the growth in our average monthly unique visitors principally to increased television and digital marketing advertising campaigns that have led to increased brand awareness, as well as increased traffic from our affinity group marketing partners.\n (5) Represents lease termination costs associated with the consolidation of the Company's office locations in Santa Monica, California. We believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons. \nAt December 31, 2015, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $112.4 million. Since inception, our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sales of shares of our capital stock and proceeds from the issuance of indebtedness.\n \u2022 The fees are fixed or determinable. \nWe define units as the number of automobiles purchased by our users from TrueCar Certified Dealers through TrueCar.com, our TrueCar branded mobile applications or the car buying sites we maintain for our affinity group marketing partners. A unit is counted following such time as we have matched the sale to a TrueCar user with one of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We view units as a key indicator of the growth of our business, the effectiveness of our product and the size and geographic coverage of our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers.\nThe results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\n \n \u2022 Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the options; \nCash used in investing activities of $5.5 million in 2013 primarily resulted from the investment in capitalized software development and property and equipment of $8.4 million which was partially offset by the release of $2.5 million in restricted cash under our modified marketing arrangement with Yahoo!, and $0.4 million of payments on notes receivable from related parties.\n \nSee Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included herein for more information about our provision for income taxes.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, sales allowances and allowances for doubtful accounts, the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, the recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets, the expensing and capitalization of software and website development costs, and the valuation and assumptions underlying stock-based compensation and other equity instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nTransaction Revenue per Franchise Dealer\nOur revenues are comprised of transaction revenues, and forecasts, consulting and other revenue.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in cost of revenue of $2.2 million or 14.5% for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in data costs and licensing fees to support the growth of our business and a $0.7 million increase in employee related costs primarily due to increases in headcount partially offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in consulting costs. The decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues during 2014 from 2013 reflected operating leverage due to our increased level of transaction revenues during 2014 as compared to the prior year.\n (3) Represents a non-recurring legal settlement in favor of the Company. We believe excluding the impact of this non-recurring legal settlement is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons. \nWe benefit consumers by providing information related to what others have paid for a make and model of car in their area and, where available, estimated prices for that make and model, which we refer to as upfront pricing information, from our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. This upfront pricing information generally includes guaranteed savings off MSRP which the consumer may then take to the dealer in the form of a Guaranteed Savings Certificate and apply toward the purchase of the specified make and model of car. We benefit our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers by enabling them to attract these informed, in-market consumers in a cost-effective, accountable manner, which we believe helps them to sell more cars profitably. We benefit OEMs by allowing them to more effectively target their incentive spending at deep-in-market consumers during their purchase process.\nthe rate at which visitors to our website and our affinity group marketing partner sites, and users of our mobile applications, obtain a Guaranteed Savings Certificate by investing in delivering a better experience to consumers and dealers; and (ii) improve close rates by investing in additional dealer support personnel. By doing so, we will be re-allocating dollars from marketing and advertising, which in the past has driven revenue growth, to make investments in our dealer, product, technology, and research efforts in order to make the changes that will improve the consumer and dealer experiences and drive revenue growth in the future.\nWe utilize a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Step one, recognition, requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, no benefits of the position are recognized. If we determine that a position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, then we proceed to step two, measurement, which is based on the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized on effective settlement. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. If actual results differ from our estimates, our net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be materially impacted.\nAverage Monthly Unique Visitors\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation of $10.7 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the departure of certain executives. \nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in interest expense of $1.6 million or 80.9% for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily reflected a decrease in interest on our convertible debt and a decrease in the accretion of debt discount resulting from a beneficial conversion feature on our convertible debt, which converted to equity in May 2013.\nComponents of Operating Results\nWe define a monthly unique visitor as an individual who has visited our website, our landing page on our affinity group marketing partner sites, or our mobile applications within a calendar month. We identify unique visitors through cookies for browser-based visits on either a desktop computer or mobile device and through device IDs for mobile application visits. In addition, if a TrueCar.com user logs-in, we supplement their identification with their log-in credentials to attempt to avoid double counting on TrueCar.com across devices, browsers and mobile applications. If an individual accesses our service using different devices or different browsers on the same device within a given month, the first access through each such device or browser is counted as a separate monthly unique visitor, except where adjusted based upon TrueCar.com log-in information. We calculate average monthly unique visitors as the sum of the monthly unique visitors in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We view our average monthly unique visitors as a key indicator of the growth in our business and audience reach, the strength of our brand, and the visibility of car buying services to the member base of our affinity group marketing partners.\nOur TrueCar Certified Dealer network includes non-franchised dealers that primarily sell used cars and are not included in franchise dealer count. Our franchise dealer count increased to 9,094 at December 31, 2015 from 8,501 at December 31, 2014 and 6,651 at December 31, 2013. A disproportionate number of the net franchise dealer additions in the second half of 2015 represented relatively lower unit volume dealers. We intend to increase the number of dealers representing high volume brands in our dealer network generally, and in key geographies, by investing to improve the dealer experience and increasing dealer satisfaction.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for an acquisition and allocate the purchase price to the respective net tangible and intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows and discount rates. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in arriving at fair value measurements in connection with fair values of assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest on our built-to-suit lease financing obligation, on our outstanding short-term debt obligations, and for the period from May 2012 to May 2013, accretion of debt discount resulting from a beneficial conversion feature on our convertible debt, which converted to equity in May 2013. In addition, beginning in August 2013, interest expense includes interest on our credit facility and the amortization of the discount on our line of credit. See Notes 5 and 6 of our consolidated financial statements included herein for more information about our debt obligations.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cost of revenue of $6.1 million or 35.1% for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $4.4 million increase in data costs and licensing fees to support the growth of our business and a $1.1 million increase in employee related costs primarily due to increases in headcount. Although we expect our cost of revenue to increase in dollar amount as we add additional data sources in the near term, we believe that the nature of our cost structure will enable us to realize operating leverage in our business over time.\nCredit Facility\nRevenue from the sale of lease residual value data and guidebooks is recognized in the period that the data or report is delivered. Revenue in connection with consulting services is recognized in the period the report is completed and delivered to the customer.\n\nRevenues\nRevenue Recognition\nSales of forecasts, consulting and other services may include multiple deliverables including sale of lease residual data, guidebooks and consulting services. We therefore recognize revenues for these arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25\u201d). ASC 605-25 was updated by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2009-13\u201d).\nProvision for Income Taxes\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $27.4 million or 88.9% for 2014 as compared to 2013 reflected $14.2 million in increased stock-based compensation due to additional stock-based awards, $7.6 million in increased salaries and related expenses due to our increased headcount, and $2.8 million in increased professional fees, comprised primarily of $2.3 million in legal fees related to a claim we filed against Sonic Automotive Holdings, Inc. ( Sonic\u201d). The remaining increase related to a $2.0 million liquidity bonus paid to an executive in connection with our IPO and $0.6 million increased insurance costs.\n (1) We issued full credits of the amount originally invoiced with respect to 12,484, 8,779, and 17,664 units during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The number of units has not been adjusted downwards related to units credited as discussed in the description of the unit metric below. \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included herein. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere herein. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nForecasts, Consulting and Other Revenue\n \n\nOur mission is to deliver the best car-buying experience for consumers and provide dealers and automakers with an excellent return on their marketing dollars. We have established an intelligent, data-driven online platform operating on a common technology infrastructure, powered by proprietary data and analytics. We operate our company-branded platform on the TrueCar website and our branded mobile experience. In addition, we customize and operate our platform on a co-branded basis for our many affinity group marketing partners, including financial institutions like USAA and American Express, membership-based organizations like Consumer Reports, AARP, Sam's Club, and AAA, and employee buying programs for large enterprises such as IBM and Walmart. We enable users to obtain market-based pricing data on new and used cars, and to connect with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We also allow automobile manufacturers, known in the industry as OEMs, to connect with TrueCar users in the purchase process and efficiently deliver targeted incentives to consumers.\n\n \u2022 Expected term. We use the simplified method under the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate expected term for plain vanilla share options. For performance-based option awards and out-of-the money option grants, we determine the expected term based upon historical exercise and post-vesting cancellations, adjusted for expected future exercise behavior; \nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in technology and development expenses of $11.5 million or 31.3% for 2015 as compared to 2014 reflected an increase of $10.6 million in increased salaries and related expenses due to our increased headcount, a $1.6 million increase in software license and hosting expenses, a $1.4 million increase in overhead related to facilities, reflecting extra space needed to accommodate increased headcount, and a $1.2 million increase in write-offs of capitalized software that we determined not to place in service. These increases were partially offset by a $2.8 million increase in the amount of salaries capitalized for the development of internal use software costs which reduced technology and development expenses during the period. Capitalized software costs increased $1.8 million for 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in the amount of salaries capitalized for the development of internal use software of $2.8 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in capitalized third-party software costs of $1.0 million. We expect our technology and development expenses to increase in dollar amount as we continue to increase our developer headcount to upgrade and enhance our technology infrastructure, invest in our products, expand the functionality of our platform and provide new product offerings. We also expect technology and development expenses to continue to be affected by variations in the amount of capitalized internally developed software.\n (3) Represents a non-recurring legal settlement in favor of the Company. We believe excluding the impact of this non-recurring legal settlement is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons. \n \u2022 Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. \nCash used in investing activities of $9.8 million for 2014 primarily resulted from investments in capitalized software development and property and equipment of $15.5 million and a purchase of $0.4 million related to the True.com domain name, which was partially offset by $4.1 million of repayments on notes receivable from related parties and the release of $2.0 million of restricted cash under our modified marketing arrangement with Yahoo!.\nUpon a user deciding to proceed with the user's vehicle purchase through us, the user provides his or her name, address, e-mail, and phone number during the process of obtaining a Guaranteed Savings Certificate, which gives us the identity and source of a TrueCar lead provided to a specific dealer prior to an actual sale occurring. After a sale occurs, we receive real-time information regarding the sale, including the identity of the purchaser, via the Dealer Management System, DMS\u201d, used by the dealer that made the sale. To the extent that a sale is not matched via comparison of user information we have to sale information provided by the DMS, we also establish matches via one or more of the over 20 different data feeds provided to the Company by third party data aggregators, loan and insurance files provided by our affinity group marketing partners and other publicly available sources. This process often results in overlapping sales matches between the DMS and multiple data feeds, resulting in a high degree of certainty with respect to our ability to identify user leads that we provide to the dealers. This data is also used to invoice dealers shortly after the completion of the sales transactions. As a result of the various data sources available to us, it is unusual for us to have difficulty in reconciling introductions provided to our network of dealers to actual vehicle sales under our platform.\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the year that includes the enactment date. We determine deferred tax assets including net operating losses and liabilities, based on temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We have a full valuation allowance, and have concluded, based on the weight of all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized, primarily due to our historical net operating losses.\nFranchise Dealer Count\nSales and Marketing Expenses\n (6) Non-GAAP net income (loss) is not a measure of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For a definition of Non-GAAP net income (loss) see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d \nContractual Obligations\nOn February 18, 2015, we amended our credit facility to provide advances of up to $35.0 million. This amended credit facility provides a $10.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit and contains an increase option permitting us, subject to the lenders consent, to increase the revolving credit facility by up to $15.0 million, to an aggregate maximum of $50 million. The credit facility has a three-year term and matures on February 18, 2018. See Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements herein for more information about our amended credit facility.\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions on an ongoing basis and that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nCash provided by financing activities of $110.4 million for 2014 reflects $69.7 million of proceeds from our initial public offering, $30.9 million of proceeds from our follow-on offering, approximately $9.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants, $5.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards, and $5.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility, which was partially offset by repayment of $10.0 million under our credit facility.\n\n\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods indicated.\n \u2022 Expected volatility. As we do not have a significant trading history for our common stock, expected volatility is derived from the historical stock volatilities of several comparable publicly listed peers over a period approximately equal to the expected term of the options. When making the selections of our comparable industry peers to be used in the volatility calculation, we considered the size, operational and economic similarities to our principal business operations; and \n (1) Includes stock-based compensation of $10.7 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the departure of certain executives. \nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest expense of $0.1 million or 16.6% for 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflect the interest expense incurred on our lease financing obligation in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in the interest on our outstanding balance of our short-term borrowings in 2014.\nSoftware and Website Development Costs\nthird-party marketing firm and a service provider and a decrease of $1.9 million in consulting fees as we have brought some services in-house that were previously performed by third parties. Although we plan to re-allocate a portion of our sales and marketing expenditures from advertising to make investments in improving our dealer relationships, we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in total due to increased headcount to better serve our existing dealers as well as television and radio advertising, digital customer acquisition costs, affinity group marketing partner fees, and other marketing programs as we grow our business.\nCosts incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages of development and maintenance of our platform are expensed as incurred. Certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a new product or projects to provide significant additional functionality to existing products are capitalized if certain criteria are met. Maintenance and enhancement costs are typically expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are estimated to be three years. Amortization expense is included in depreciation and amortization in the statements of comprehensive loss.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment and intangible assets resulting from business combinations, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured first by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. When measuring the recoverability of these assets, we make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to impair these assets. We have not recognized any impairment of long-lived assets to date.\nOverview\nWe have not established VSOE or TPE for our forecasts, consulting and other services because the deliverables are not sold separately within a sufficiently narrow price range or third party pricing for comparable services is not available; therefore, we apply judgment to determine BESP. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The determination of BESP requires us to make significant estimates and judgments and we consider numerous factors in this determination, including the nature of the deliverables, market conditions and our competitive landscape, internal costs, and our pricing and discounting practices associated with actual transactions. We update our estimates of BESP on a periodic basis as events and as circumstances may require.\n\nTransaction Revenue. Revenue consists of fees paid by dealers participating in our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. Dealers pay us these fees either on a per vehicle basis for sales to our users or in the form of a subscription arrangement. Subscription arrangements fall into three types: flat rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales ( guaranteed sales\u201d) and subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions ( guaranteed introductions\u201d). Under flat rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of sales made to users of our platform by the dealer. For flat rate subscription arrangements, we recognize the fees as revenue over the subscription period on a straight line basis which corresponds to the period that we are providing the dealer with access to our platform. Under guaranteed sales subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. Under guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees. For guaranteed sales and guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, we recognize revenue based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of sales generated or introductions delivered through our platform during the subscription period multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction or (ii) the guaranteed number of sales or introductions multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction.\nThe number of units increased 22.8% to 750,108 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 610,620 for the year ended December 31, 2014. We attribute this growth in units to the effectiveness of our increased marketing activities, product enhancements, the growing number and geographic coverage of TrueCar Certified Dealers in our network, and the overall growth in new car sales in the automotive industry.\nTransaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred, and are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.\nTechnology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance and stock-based compensation expenses, third-party contractor fees, and allocated overhead primarily associated with development of our platform, as well as our product development, product management, research and analytics and internal IT functions.\nThe first step (\"Step 1\") involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then the second step is to compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value. The estimate of implied fair value of goodwill may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\n\n (4) We incurred severance costs of $0.6 million and $2.8 million for executive-level employees who terminated during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, we also incurred $0.3 million of related recruiting fees for the placement of our new CEO in the fourth quarter of 2015. We believe excluding the impact of these costs from 2015 is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of ongoing operating results. \ndetermine the fair value of our common stock based on the closing price as quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select Market of our common stock on the grant date.\nContractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in our business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $4.4 million or 33.6% for 2015 as compared to 2014 reflected a growth in capitalized software costs and higher investments in property and equipment. We expect our depreciation and amortization expenses to continue to be affected by the amount of capitalized internally developed software costs, property and equipment and the timing of placing projects in service. Further, as we invest in and upgrade our technology infrastructure, depending on the timing of these upgrades, we may shorten the useful lives of some of our existing assets and accelerate related amortization expense.\nDuring the second half of 2015, we experienced a decline in the proportion of dealers representing high volume brands in our network and slowed quarter over quarter revenue growth. A disproportionate number of the net franchise dealer additions in the second half of 2015 represented relatively lower unit volume dealers. As a result, our close rates fell in the fourth quarter of 2015, and we were unable to generate unit growth commensurate with the growth in traffic. To increase growth rates, we intend to: (i) increase\nWe also derive revenue from providing forecasts, consulting and other services to the automotive and financial services industries. Additional revenue sources include lead referral fees, advertising fees earned from display advertisements on the TrueCar.com website, and data licensing fees earned for licensing certain proprietary data to third parties. We generally recognize revenue upon delivery of such services.\nWe define transaction revenue per franchise dealer as the aggregate transaction revenue we receive in a given period divided by the average franchise dealer count in that period. We calculate average franchise dealer count in a given period as the average of the franchise dealer count at the beginning of the period and the franchise dealer count at the end of the period. Our transaction revenue per franchise dealer increased 9.8% to $27,439 during the year ended December 31, 2015 from $24,994 for the year ended December 31, 2014. These increases primarily reflect an increase in units which was attributable to an increase in marketing spend and an increase in the number of TrueCar Certified Dealers, platform and product enhancements, and the overall growth in sales of the automotive industry.\n\nRevenues\nOur lease obligations consist of various leases for office space. We also have purchase obligations for data information, software related licenses and support services. For further discussion, see Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements included herein. Contingent obligations arising from unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the contractual obligations because it is expected that the unrecognized benefits would only result in an insignificant amount of cash payments.\nQuarterly Key Metrics and Results of Operations\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met:\nCash provided by financing activities of $31.2 million in 2013 reflects net proceeds of $29.9 million from the issuance of 2,857,143 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in a private placement, and $5.0 million from a draw down under our Credit Facility. These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million repurchase of vested option awards pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into with a former executive, a $1.0 million repurchase of outstanding common stock pursuant to an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, $0.6 million for payments of costs related to our initial public offering, and $0.4 million of payments of contingent consideration related to the Carperks acquisition. The remaining contingent consideration related to the Carperks acquisition of $1.9 million was paid in 2014. Of this total, $0.4 million was part of the estimated purchase price and has been classified as a financing cash out flow. The additional $1.5 million has been classified as an operating cash outflow.\nYears ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Our provision for income taxes for 2015 2014, and 2013 primarily reflected tax expense due to amortization of tax deductible goodwill that is not an available source of income to realize our deferred tax assets.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.6 million or 14.2% for 2014 as compared to 2013 reflected a growth in capitalized software costs and higher investments in property and equipment.\n \u2022 Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. \nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in sales and marketing expenses of $53.4 million or 71.0% for 2014 as compared to 2013 reflected a $35.9 million increase in advertising and promotional activities primarily due to increased television, radio and online marketing spend to grow the TrueCar.com brand, and a $13.1 million increase in affinity partner marketing fees as a result of our increased level of unit sales and increased promotional activities, such as loan subvention, where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of customers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners to incentivize their customers to use our platform. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2014 also reflected a $4.9 million increase in salaries and related expenses primarily due to our increased headcount, an increase of $2.2 million in stock-based compensation due to additional stock-based awards, an increase of $1.6 million in warrant expense related to warrants issued to our third-party marketing firm and service provider, a $0.8 million increase associated with the purchase of our ticker symbol TRUE\u201d, and an increase of $0.6 million associated with a liquidity bonus paid to a sales executive in connection with our IPO. These increases in sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by a decrease of $5.6 million in our corporate sponsorship expense as a result of terminating certain sponsorship agreements that we determined to be ineffective.\nInterest Expense\n\n (4) We incurred severance costs of $0.6 million and $2.8 million for executive-level employees who terminated during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, we also incurred $0.3 million of related recruiting fees for the placement of our new CEO in the fourth quarter of 2015. We believe excluding the impact of these terminations from 2015 is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of ongoing operating results. \n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nWe also recognize revenue from dealers under subscription arrangements. Subscription fee arrangements are short-term in nature with terms ranging from one to six months and are cancellable by the dealer or us at any time. Subscription arrangements fall into three types: flat rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales ( guaranteed sales\u201d) and subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions ( guaranteed introductions\u201d). Under flat rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of sales made to users of our platform by the dealer. For flat rate subscription arrangements, we recognize the fees as revenue over the subscription period on a straight line basis which corresponds to the period that we are providing the dealer with access to our platform. Under guaranteed sales subscription arrangements fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. Under guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the dealer. To the extent that the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees. For guaranteed sales and guaranteed introductions subscription arrangements, we recognize revenue based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of sales generated or introductions delivered through our platform during the subscription period multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction or (ii) the guaranteed number of sales or introductions multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\n\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nInvesting Activities\nWe define monetization as the average transaction revenue per unit, which we calculate by dividing all of our transaction revenue in a given period by the number of units in that period. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our monetization increased 3.9% to $322 from $310 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in monetization is primarily a result of improved subscription pricing optimization and growth in used vs new mix, the independent dealer channel, and in revenue from automobile manufacturers, known in the industry as OEMs. We expect our monetization to be affected in the future by changes in our pricing structure, the unit mix between new and used cars, with used cars providing higher monetization, and by the introduction of new products and services.\nFinancing Activities\n* Less than 0.5% of revenues\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make operating and strategic decisions.\nOur investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for capitalized software development costs and property and equipment and changes in restricted cash requirements associated with our modified marketing arrangement with Yahoo!.\n\nWe have accumulated federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $221.2 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $156.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nWe previously entered into a credit facility with a financial institution that provided for advances under a formula-based revolving line of credit and had no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2015.\nWe determine our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical write-off experience and when specific circumstances make it likely that recovery will not occur. We review the allowance for doubtful accounts periodically and assesses the aging of account balances, with an emphasis on those that are past due over ninety days. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Non-GAAP net (loss) income for each of the periods presented:\n\nCash used in operating activities in 2015 was $11.4 million. This was primarily due to our net loss of $64.9 million, which, adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $17.3 million, stock-based compensation expense of $42.6 million, and loss on disposal of fixed assets of $1.6 million, resulted in $2.7 million in cash used in operations. This use of cash was also due to $8.6 million in changes to operating assets and liabilities, which primarily reflected a decrease of $6.5 million in accrued employee expenses primarily related to lower accrued bonuses, an increase of $5.9 million in accounts receivable primarily related to increased revenues, a decrease of $1.8 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to decreased marketing fees. These were partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to increased affinity group marketing fees and growth in our business and a decrease of $1.1 million in other current assets primarily due to a decrease in a receivable from a legal settlement in our favor.\n (2) Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) are not measures of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss), see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nTransaction Revenue\n (6) Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d \nCash used in investing activities of $29.8 million for 2015 resulted primarily from $13.8 million of investments in software, $12.7 million of investments in furniture, leasehold, and facility improvements primarily associated with our San Francisco and Santa Monica office spaces, and $3.3 million of investment in computer hardware.\nInterest Income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. General and administrative expenses increased $25.2 million or 43.2% for 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase reflected $13.9 million in increased stock-based compensation due primarily to the acceleration and modification of equity awards related to certain terminated executives of $10.7 million, additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million associated with the surrender and forfeiture of unvested options held by our former president and additional stock-based compensation of $1.1 million primarily related to awards granted in 2015. Other increases in general and administrative expenses include an increase of $5.3 million in professional fees, which includes an increase of $4.5 million in legal fees related to ongoing litigation, an increase of $3.6 million in overhead related to facilities, which includes $2.2 million in real estate exit costs associated with certain leased facilities that we exited in the fourth quarter of 2015, and an increase of $2.1 million in salaries and related expenses, primarily due to executive severance. For further discussion of executive severance, refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements contained herein. We expect to continue to incur significant legal fees related to ongoing litigation.\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2014 was $3.1 million. This was primarily due to our net loss of $48.4 million, which, adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $13.0 million, stock-based compensation expense of $29.3 million, common stock warrant expense of $9.9 million, and other non-cash adjustments of $1.3 million, resulted in $5.1 million in cash provided by operations. This was offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in changes to operating assets and liabilities, which reflected a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $4.3 million, primarily related to increases in accrued marketing expenses, legal costs, and construction costs; a decrease in accrued employee expenses of $3.9 million related to increased accrued bonuses driven by growth in headcount; and a decrease in accounts payable of $3.4 million, primarily related to affinity group marketing fees. These were partially offset by a $10.4 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of our increased revenues, $1.7 million increase in prepaid expenses related to media production, insurance, and software costs, and a $1.3 million increase in other assets related to amounts receivable from a legal settlement in our favor.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Cost of revenue includes expenses related to the fulfillment of our services, consisting primarily of data costs and licensing fees paid to third party service providers and expenses related to operating our website and mobile applications, including those associated with our data centers, hosting fees, data processing costs required to deliver introductions to our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers, employee costs related to dealer operations, sales matching, and employee and consulting costs related to delivering data and consulting services to our customers. Cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization of software costs and other hosting and data infrastructure equipment used to operate our platforms, which are included in the depreciation and amortization line item on our statement of comprehensive loss.\nWe have incurred cumulative losses of $275.9 million from our operations through December 31, 2015, and expect to incur additional losses in the future. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the timing and extent of our spending to support our technology and development efforts. To the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents, and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\n \u2022 Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.  Deferred revenue is recognized on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets when payments are received in advance of us meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria described above.\nOn occasion we issue credits to our TrueCar Certified Dealers with respect to units sold. However, we do not adjust our unit metric for these credits as we believe that in substantially all cases a vehicle has in fact been purchased through our platform given the high degree of accuracy of our sales matching process. Credits are most frequently issued to a dealer that claims it had a pre-existing relationship with a purchaser of a vehicle, and we determine whether to issue a credit based on a number of factors, including the facts and circumstances related to the dealer claim and the level of claim activity at the dealership. In most cases, we issue credits in order to maintain strong business relations with the dealer and not because we have made an erroneous sales match or billing error.\nGoodwill\nWe define franchise dealer count as the number of franchise dealers in the network of TrueCar Certified Dealers at the end of a given period. This number is calculated by counting the number of brands of new cars sold by dealers in the TrueCar Certified Dealer network at their locations, and includes both single-location proprietorships as well as large consolidated dealer groups. The network comprises dealers with a range of unit sales volume per dealer, with dealers representing certain brands consistently achieving higher than average unit sales volume. We view our ability to increase our franchise dealer count, particularly dealers representing high volume brands, as an indicator of our market penetration and the likelihood of converting users of our platform into unit sales.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. We provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 as it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result of the valuation allowance, our income tax benefit (or expense) is significantly less than the federal statutory rate of 34%. Our provision for income taxes in 2015, 2014, and 2013 primarily\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries in accordance with FASB ASC 810 - Consolidation. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nthe adequacy of the sales allowance, we evaluate our history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the financial statements. While estimated sales adjustments and credits and ultimate losses may vary from actual results, and could be material to the financial statements, actual sales allowances have been materially consistent with our estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nTechnology and Development Expenses\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in technology and development expenses of $12.9 million or 54.4% for 2014 as compared to 2013 reflected an increase of $7.9 million in increased salaries and related expenses due to our increased headcount, an increase in stock-based compensation due to additional stock-based awards of $3.9 million, a $1.8 million increase in software license and hosting expenses, and a $0.7 million increase in overhead related to facilities, reflecting extra space needed to accommodate increased headcount. These increases were partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in the amount of salaries capitalized for the development of internal use software costs which reduced technology and development expenses during the period. Capitalized software costs increased $7.1 million for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the costs for a perpetual software license of $5.0 million during 2014, an increase in the amount of salaries capitalized for the development of internal use software of $1.4 million, and increases in other third-party software costs of $0.7 million.\nWe report our financial results as one operating segment, with two distinct service offerings: transactions, and forecasts, consulting and other. Our operating results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker on a consolidated basis, principally to make decisions about how we allocate our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance. Our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews revenue for each of our transaction and data and other offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the factors driving our business.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted to our employees, consultants and other service providers that can be settled in shares of our common stock. We estimate the grant date fair value of option grants, and the resulting stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, we use the market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant to determine the fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation for employee awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite period, except for performance-based awards, which are recognized using the graded-vesting model. As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, such expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nWe recognize revenue for fee arrangements based on a per vehicle basis when the vehicle sale has occurred between the automotive buying website program user and dealer. Under the contractual terms and conditions with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers, the dealer is required to pay us upon the sale of a vehicle to a user that has been provided to the dealer by us. Revenue recognition is not contingent on verification or acceptance of the transaction by the dealer.\nUnits\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of: television and radio advertising; affinity group partner marketing fees, which also includes loan subvention costs where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of consumers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners, and common stock warrants issued to USAA; marketing sponsorship programs; and digital customer acquisition. See Part III, Item 13 Certain Relationships, Related Party and Other Transactions - Strategic Partnerships - United Services Automobile Association\u201d for a description of our arrangements with USAA. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include employee related expenses for sales, customer support, marketing and public relations employees, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses; third-party contractor fees; and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include costs related to common stock warrants issued to a third-party marketing firm and a service provider as part of our commercial arrangements with them. Marketing and advertising costs promote our services and are expensed as incurred, except for media production costs which are expensed the first time the advertisement is aired.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n \nWe do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, as part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows are not subject to off-balance sheet risks.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nPrior to the date our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the fair value of our common stock had been approved by the board of directors at each grant date based on a variety of factors, including periodic valuations of our common stock, our financial position, historical financial performance, projected financial performance, valuations of publicly traded peer companies arm's-length sales of our common stock, and the illiquid nature of common stock. Since our initial public offering, we\nOur subsidiary, ALG, Inc., provides forecasts and consulting services regarding determination of the residual value of an automobile at given future points in time. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition, financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease, and fleet portfolios. We also obtain automobile purchase data from a variety of sources and use this data to provide consumers and dealers with highly accurate, geographically specific, real-time pricing information.\nCash used in operating activities in 2013 was $3.9 million, primarily as a result of our net loss of $25.1 million and a $6.7 million use of cash as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, which was largely offset by $27.9 million of non-cash operating expenses. The $6.7 million use of cash as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities reflected an $8.2 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of our increased revenues, a $2.0 million increase in prepaid expenses primarily associated with our increased media advertising spend, a decrease of $1.2 million in accrued expenses primarily associated with the modification of the marketing arrangement with Yahoo! in 2012, partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in accrued employee expenses due to an increase in accrued bonuses driven by our improved financial results, and a $1.4 million increase in accounts payable associated with the growth in our business.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our revenues of $53.2 million or 25.7%, for 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflected the increase in our transaction revenue. Transaction revenue and forecasts, consulting and other revenue comprised 92.9% and 7.1%, respectively, of revenues for 2015 as compared to 91.6% and 8.4%, respectively, for 2014. The increase in transaction revenue for 2015 primarily reflected a 22.8% increase in units due to an increase in marketing spend and an increase in the number of TrueCar Certified Dealers, platform and product enhancements, and the overall growth in sales of the automotive industry. Our average monthly unique visitors grew 39.6% to 6.0 million during 2015 from 4.3 million during 2014, reflecting our increased advertising expenses which improved brand awareness and the visibility of our car buying services to our users. Our monetization increased 3.9% to $322 during 2015 from $310 for 2014, primarily as a result of improved subscription pricing optimization and growth in used vehicle vs. new vehicle mix, the independent dealer channel, and in revenue from OEMs. Monetization may fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in our estimated sales allowance, pricing and the unit mix between new and used cars. The 6.6% increase in forecasts, consulting and other revenue for 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflected an increase in volume of portfolio risk analyses and residual value forecasts provided to customers. We expect revenues to grow modestly in 2016.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:\n \nDetermining the fair value of awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock, which are key inputs in the determination of the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:\nOperating Activities\nAt December 31, 2015 total remaining stock-based compensation expense for unvested awards was $56.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.13 years.\n (2) The excluded amounts relate to legal costs incurred in connection with a claim we filed against Sonic Automotive Holdings, Inc., complaints filed by non-TrueCar dealers and the California New Car Dealers Association against TrueCar and securities class action lawsuits. We believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons. \nForecasts, Consulting and Other Revenue. \"Data and other revenue\" as disclosed in periods prior to 2015 is now referred to as \"forecasts, consulting and other revenue\" as we believe this description is more accurate and reflective of the actual service offerings that we provide. We derive this type of revenue primarily from the provision of forecasts and consulting services to the automotive and financial services industries through our ALG subsidiary. The forecasts and consulting services that ALG provides typically relate to the determination of the residual value of an automobile at given future points in time. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition, financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease and fleet portfolios. Our customers generally pay us for these services as information is delivered to them.\nRevenue is recognized net of estimated sales allowances. We establish sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on our history of adjustments and credits provided to our TrueCar Certified Dealers. Sales allowances relate primarily to credits issued where a dealer claims that an introduction was previously identified by the dealer from a source other than us. While the dealer is contractually obligated to pay the invoice, we may issue a credit against the invoice to maintain overall dealer relations. In assessing\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses for executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, and business intelligence personnel. General and administrative expenses also include legal, accounting, and other third-party professional service fees, bad debt, lease exit costs, and allocated overhead.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in sales and marketing expenses of $22.4 million or 17.4% for 2015 as compared to 2014 reflected a $19.3 million increase in advertising and promotional activities primarily due to increased television, radio and online marketing spend, and a $3.4 million increase in affinity partner marketing fees as a result of our increased level of unit sales and increased promotional activities, such as loan subvention, where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of customers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners to incentivize their customers to use our platform. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2015 also reflected a $7.2 million increase in salaries and related expenses primarily due to our increased headcount. These increases in sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by a decrease of $5.1 million in warrant expense related to warrants issued to a\nMonetization\nThe following tables set forth selected key metrics and unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data for each of the quarters indicated. The consolidated financial statements for each of these quarters have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the consolidated results of operations for these periods. You should read this information together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.\nOur net loss and cash flows used in operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support our growth, and marketing, advertising and sponsorship expenses. Our net loss has been significantly greater than cash used in or provided by operating activities due to the inclusion of non-cash expenses and charges.\nBusiness Combinations\nKey Metrics\nIn addition, some automobile manufacturers promote the sale of their vehicles through the offering of additional consumer incentives to members of our affinity group marketing partners. These manufacturers pay a per-vehicle fee to us for promotion of the incentive and we recognize as revenue the per-vehicle incentive fee at the time the sale of the vehicle has occurred between the Automotive Website Program user and the dealer.\n (2) The excluded amounts relate to legal costs incurred in connection with a claim we filed against Sonic Automotive Holdings, Inc., complaints filed by non-TrueCar dealers and the California New Car Dealers Association against TrueCar and securities class action lawsuits. We believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons. \n \u2022 Dividend yield. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.  In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based upon an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n (5) Represents lease termination costs associated with the consolidation of the Company's office locations in Santa Monica, California. We believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated revenues of $259.8 million and recorded a net loss of $64.9 million. Of the $259.8 million in revenues, 92.9% consisted of transaction revenues with the remaining 7.1% derived primarily from the sale of forecasts, consulting and other services to the automotive and financial services industries. Revenues from the sale of forecasts, consulting and other services are derived primarily from the operations of our ALG subsidiary. Transaction revenues primarily consist of fees paid to us by our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers under our pay-for-performance business model where we generally earn a fee only when a TrueCar user purchases a car from them.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms, and forfeiture rates utilized for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate assumptions, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nSet forth below is information concerning our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 that are fixed and determinable.\nIn addition, we enter into arrangements with automobile manufacturers to promote the sale of their vehicles through the offering of additional consumer incentives to members of our affinity group marketing partners. These manufacturers pay us a per-vehicle fee for promotion of the incentive and we recognize the per-vehicle incentive fee when the vehicle sale has occurred between the member of our affinity group marketing partner and the dealer.", "item_7_tables": "Table 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Total revenues for 2015 were $259.8 million, up 25.7% from 2014. The increase was driven primarily by a 22.8% increase in units sold due to higher marketing spend, more TrueCar Certified Dealers, product enhancements, and overall auto industry growth.\n\n- Net loss for 2015 was $64.9 million compared to $48.4 million in 2014. The increased loss reflects continued investments in growth.\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA was $7.6 million in 2015 compared to $10.9 million in 2014. The decrease reflects slowing revenue growth in the second half of 2015. \n\n- Cash used in operating activities was $11.4 million in 2015 compared to cash provided of $3.1 million in 2014, due to the increased net loss.\n\n- Key revenue metrics: \n  - Average monthly unique visitors grew 39.6% to 6.0 million in 2015.\n  - Units grew 22.8% to 750,108 in 2015. \n  - Monetization increased 3.9% to $322 in 2015.\n  - Franchise dealer count grew to 9,094 at December 31, 2015.\n\n- To drive growth going forward, the company plans to increase high volume brand dealers, improve dealer relationships, and increase close rates.\n\nIn summary, TrueCar grew strongly in 2015 but saw slowing growth in the second half. The company invested in growth which led to wider losses. Key focus areas going forward are improving dealer relationships and close rates."}
