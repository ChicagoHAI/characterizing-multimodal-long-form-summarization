MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel anti-infective agents to treat serious infections. We have two product candidates that have been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for approval: lefamulin, potentially the first pleuromutilin antibiotic available for oral and intravenous (or IV) administration in humans, for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP and CONTEPO, a potentially first-in-class epoxide antibiotic for intravenous (or IV) use in the United States for complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTI. We may potentially develop lefamulin and CONTEPO for additional indications. Both lefamulin formulations and CONTEPO were granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, and Fast Track designation by the FDA, enabling Priority Review of the New Drug Applications, or the NDAs by the FDA.\nLefamulin is a semi-synthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic discovered and developed by our team with the potential to be first-in-class for IV and oral in humans. It inhibits the synthesis of bacterial protein, which is required for bacteria to grow by binding with high affinity, high specificity and at molecular targets that are different than other antibiotic classes. Based on results from two global, Phase 3 clinical trials, we believe that lefamulin is well-positioned for use as a first-line monotherapy for the treatment of CABP due to its novel mechanism of action, targeted spectrum of activity, resistance profile, achievement of substantial drug concentration in lung tissue and fluid, availability of oral and IV formulations and a\ngenerally well-tolerated safety profile. We believe lefamulin represents a potentially important new treatment option for the five to six million adults in the United States diagnosed with CABP each year.\nOn July 24, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Zavante Therapeutics, Inc., or Zavante, a privately-held late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies to improve the outcomes of hospitalized patients. Zavante's lead product candidate is CONTEPO\u2122 (fosfomycin for injection, previously referred to as ZTI-01 and ZOLYD).\nCONTEPO is a novel, potentially first-in-class investigational intravenous antibiotic in the United States with a broad spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram-positive activity, including activity against most contemporary multi-drug resistant, or MDR, strains such as extended-spectrum b-lactamase-, or ESBL, producing Enterobacteriaceae. IV fosfomycin has been approved for a number of indications and utilized for over 45 years in Europe to treat a variety of serious bacterial infections, including cUTIs. CONTEPO utilizes a new dosing regimen that optimize its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We believe these attributes, the extensive clinical experience worldwide and the positive efficacy and safety results from the Phase 2/3 clinical trial support CONTEPO as a first-line treatment for cUTIs, including acute pyelonephritis, or AP, suspected to be caused by MDR pathogens. At least 20% of cUTIs are caused by MDR bacteria and limited treatment options are available in the U.S. In addition, non-clinical data have shown that CONTEPO acts in combination with certain other antibiotics to improve bacterial killing.\nWe submitted an NDA, for marketing approval of CONTEPO for the treatment of cUTI in adults in the United States, to the FDA in October 2018. The NDA submission is utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and is supported by a robust data package, including a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial (known as ZEUS\u2122), which met its primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority to piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with cUTI, including AP. We submitted two NDAs to the FDA for the oral and IV formulations of lefamulin for the treatment of CABP in December 2018. The FDA has granted us a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date of April 30, 2019 for CONTEPO and a PDUFA target action date of August 19, 2019 for lefamulin. We plan to submit a marketing authorization application for lefamulin in Europe in the first half of 2019. The two NDAs are supported by two pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trials (known as LEAP 1 and LEAP 2) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of IV and oral lefamulin compared to moxifloxacin in the treatment of adults with CABP, including the option to switch from IV to oral administration and a short course oral treatment with lefamulin. In both LEAP 1 and LEAP 2, lefamulin was demonstrated to be non-inferior to moxifloxacin, and met both the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for the treatment of CABP. Lefamulin was also shown to be generally well-tolerated when administered either orally or intravenously.\nBoth lefamulin formulations and CONTEPO were granted QIDP and Fast Track designation by the FDA, enabling potential Priority Review of the NDAs by the FDA. We were notified by the FDA that CONTEPO IV and both formulations of lefamulin were granted Priority Review following acceptance of the NDAs. We currently have a team of regional business directors and medical science liaisons in the field performing educational and market development activities. We plan to use a targeted hospital-based sales force to promote both lefamulin formulations and CONTEPO, if approved.\nWe believe that pleuromutilin antibiotics can help address the major public health threat posed by bacterial resistance, which the World Health Organization, or WHO, characterized in 2017 as one of the biggest threats to human health. Increasing resistance to antibiotics used to treat CABP is a growing concern and has become an issue in selecting the appropriate initial antibiotic treatment prior to determining the specific microbiological cause of the infection, referred to as empiric treatment. For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, has classified Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common respiratory pathogen, as a serious threat to human health as a result of\nincreasing resistance to currently available antibiotics. In addition, the CDC recently reported on the growing evidence of widespread resistance to macrolides, widely used antibiotics that disrupt bacterial protein synthesis, in Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common cause of CABP that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or MRSA, which has also been designated as a serious threat to human health by the CDC, has emerged as a more common cause of CABP in some regions of the world, and a possible pathogen to be covered with empiric therapy.\nAs a result of increasing resistance to antibiotics and the wide array of potential pathogens that cause CABP, the current standard of care for hospitalized patients with CABP whose treatment is initiated in the hospital usually involves first-line empiric treatment with a combination of antibiotics (beta-lactams and macrolides) to address all likely bacterial pathogens or monotherapy with a fluoroquinolone. Combination therapy presents the logistical challenge of administering multiple drugs with different dosing regimens, with some drugs available only as IV, and increases the risk of drug-drug interactions and the potential for serious side effects. Fluoroquinolones are associated with safety and tolerability concerns, including a relatively high risk for developing Clostridium difficile infection and increasing rates of resistance for uropathogens. We believe these concerns have resulted in a decreasing use of fluoroquinolones and restriction of their use within a growing number of hospitals. In addition, in May 2016, the FDA announced that an FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones, when used systemically, in the form of tablets, capsules and injectable, are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects that can occur together. These side effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system. Fluoroquinolones are typically administered in combination with other antibiotics, if community-acquired MRSA is suspected. In addition, many currently available antibiotic therapies are only available for IV administration and are prescribed for seven to fourteen days, meaning continued treatment requires prolonged hospitalization or a switch to a different antibiotic administered orally, with the attendant risk that the patient might respond differently.\nEffective January 1, 2017, the Joint Commission & Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, began requiring all U.S. hospitals to have Antibiotic Management guidelines, also known as \"Stewardship\" Committees, in place to identify antibiotics most appropriate and targeted to each individual patient's infection. Past efforts to \"cast the widest net possible\" with broad-spectrum antibiotics that affect many types of bacteria have caused problems, such as C. difficile infections, by killing good bacteria or increased antibiotic resistance in other bacteria in different areas of the body. Additionally, in 2016, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, or IDSA/SHEA, updated their Antibiotic Stewardship guidelines for antibiotic use. We believe that three key goals from these guidelines are applicable to the treatment of CABP:\n\u2022 Reduce the risk of antibiotics associated with a high risk of C. difficile infections;\n\u2022 Increase use of oral antibiotics as a strategy to improve outcomes or decrease costs; and\n\u2022 Reduce antibiotic therapy to the shortest effective duration.\nConsistent with the Antimicrobial Stewardship principles, we believe that lefamulin could be well suited as either a first-line or second-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of CABP patients in the hospital setting, outpatient-transition of care or in the community setting, because of its novel mechanism of action, complete spectrum of activity for CABP pathogens, including against multidrug resistant strains, achievement of substantial drug concentrations in lung fluids and lung immune cells, and flexibility as step down oral agent with both the IV and oral formulations and favorable safety and tolerability profile.\nCONTEPO (fosfomycin for injection) is a novel, potentially first-in-class investigational intravenous antibiotic in the United States with a broad spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram-positive activity, including activity against most contemporary MDR strains such as ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. CONTEPO inhibits the bacteria's ability to form a normal cell wall, which is critical for the cell's survival and growth. It works at an earlier and different stage of cell wall synthesis than other injectable antibiotics, differentiating its mechanism of action from approved injectable antibiotics. CONTEPO utilizes a dosing approach developed by Zavante for the United States that is designed to optimize its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in order to improve treatment outcomes.\nThe CONTEPO development program has focused on obtaining marketing approval in the United States for the treatment of cUTIs, including AP. In April 2017, Zavante announced the results of the pivotal ZEUS Study, in which CONTEPO met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority versus PIP-TAZ. Zavante then met with the FDA in the second half of 2017 to discuss the filing of an NDA for CONTEPO. We submitted an NDA for marketing approval of CONTEPO for the treatment of cUTI in adults in the United States, to the FDA in October 2018. The FDA has granted us PDUFA target action date of April 30, 2019 for CONTEPO.\nWe believe that the ZEUS Study results, along with extensive clinical experience with IV fosfomycin for over 45 years outside the United States, support CONTEPO as a potential first-line treatment for cUTI suspected to be caused by MDR pathogens in the United States. A number of studies report that at least 20% of cUTIs are caused by MDR bacteria and limited treatment options are available in the United States. In addition, non-clinical data have shown that CONTEPO acts in combination with certain other antibiotics to improve bacterial killing.\nThe FDA has designated CONTEPO as a QIDP and granted Fast Track designations to CONTEPO under the GAIN Act for:\n\u2022 complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTI\n\u2022 complicated intra-abdominal infections, or cIAI\n\u2022 hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or HABP\n\u2022 ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, or VABP\n\u2022 acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, or ABSSSI\nAlthough we have no current plans to finance development of CONTEPO for indications other than cUTI, including AP, these designations make CONTEPO eligible for Fast Track and Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, incentives. We may in the future consider additional non-dilutive financing options to advance these programs in the clinic.\nIn recognition of the growing need for the development of new antibiotics, recent regulatory changes, including Priority Review and regulatory guidance enabling smaller clinical trials, have led to renewed interest from the pharmaceutical industry in anti-infective development. For example, the FDA Safety and Innovation Act became law in 2012 and included the GAIN Act, which provides incentives, including access to expedited FDA review for approval, Fast Track designation and five years of potential data exclusivity extension for the development of new QIDPs.\nOn March 1, 2017, Nabriva Therapeutics plc, or Nabriva Ireland, was incorporated in Ireland under the name Hyacintho 2 plc, and was renamed to Nabriva Therapeutics plc on April 10, 2017, in order to effectuate the change of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the ultimate company of the group from Austria to Ireland. Nabriva Ireland replaced Nabriva Therapeutics AG, or Nabriva Austria, as the ultimate parent company on June 23, 2017, following the conclusion of a tender offer, or the Exchange Offer, in which holders of 98.6% of the outstanding share capital of Nabriva Austria exchanged their holdings for ordinary shares, $0.01 nominal value per share, of Nabriva Ireland, which\nwe refer to as the Redomiciliation Transaction. The ordinary shares of Nabriva Ireland were issued on a one-for-ten basis to the holders of the Nabriva Austria common shares and on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the Nabriva Austria American Depositary Shares, or Nabriva Austria ADSs, participating in the Exchange Offer. On June 26, 2017, the ordinary shares of Nabriva Ireland began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \"NBRV,\" the same symbol under which the Nabriva Austria ADSs were previously traded. This transaction was accounted for as a merger between entities under common control; accordingly, the historical financial statements of Nabriva Austria for periods prior to this transaction are considered to be the historical financial statements of Nabriva Ireland. As of August 18, 2017, 100% of Nabriva Austria share capital had been exchanged for ordinary shares of Nabriva Ireland.\nNabriva Austria was incorporated in October 2005 in Austria under the name Nabriva Therapeutics Forschungs GmbH, a limited liability company organized under Austrian law, as a spin-off from Sandoz GmbH and commenced operations in February 2006. In 2007, Nabriva Austria transformed into a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) under the name Nabriva Therapeutics AG. On October 19, 2017, Nabriva Austria was converted into a limited liability company under Austrian law and renamed Nabriva Therapeutics GmbH. In 2014, we established our wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, which began operations in August 2014.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $394.0 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through our 2018 equity offering, our term loan, our \"at-the-market\" offering facility, our 2017 equity offering, our 2016 rights offering, our 2015 initial public offering, private placements of our equity securities, convertible loans and research and development support from governmental grants and loans. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials. Our ability to generate profits from operations and remain profitable depends on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize drugs that generate significant revenue.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect to continue to invest in critical pre-commercialization and supply chain activities prior to potentially receiving marketing approval for lefamulin and CONTEPO and making them available to patients.\nOur expenses will increase if we suffer any regulatory delays or are required to conduct additional clinical trials to satisfy regulatory requirements. If we obtain marketing approval for lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, in-license or acquire, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing.\nIn December 2018, we announced the closing of up to a $75.0 million term loan with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, $25.0 million of which was funded on the day of closing. Under the terms of the loan, in addition to the $25.0 million received at closing, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $15.0 million in two tranches upon the approval by the FDA of the NDAs recently submitted for lefamulin and CONTEPO. We will also be eligible to receive an additional $30.0 million of aggregate term loan advances in three separate tranches upon the achievement of specified product revenue milestones. These additional tranches are at our discretion and may only be drawn upon during specified periods of time. The final $5.0 million tranche is available through December 31, 2021, subject to Hercules' sole discretion. We are entitled to make interest-only payments through July 1, 2020, with incremental extensions through January 1, 2022 upon the achievement of specified performance milestones. We are required to repay the term loan after the interest only period based on a monthly amortization schedule, with a final maturity date occurring on June 1, 2023.\nBased on our current plans, we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, lefamulin and CONTEPO. We do not expect to\nobtain marketing approval for CONTEPO before April 2019 or for lefamulin before August 2019, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization effort.\nAcquisition of Zavante\nOn July 24, 2018, we acquired Zavante, or the Acquisition,, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing CONTEPO (fosfomycin for injection) to improve the outcomes of hospitalized patients pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 23, 2018, or the Merger Agreement.\nUpon the closing of the Acquisition, or the Closing, we issued 7,336,906 of our ordinary shares to former Zavante stockholders, which together with the 815,186 ordinary shares that are issuable upon release of the Holdback Shares (as defined below) constitute approximately 19.9% of our ordinary shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing, or the Upfront Shares.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, former Zavante stockholders and other equity holders, in the aggregate and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, will also be entitled to receive from us up to $97.5 million in contingent consideration, of which $25.0 million would become payable upon the first approval of an NDA from the the FDA for fosfomycin for injection for any indication, or the Approval Milestone Payment, and an aggregate of up to $72.5 million would become payable upon the achievement of specified sales milestones, or the Net Sales Milestone Payments.\nAt our Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held in October 2018, our shareholders approved the issuance of ordinary shares in settlement of potential milestone payment obligations that may become payable in the future to former Zavante stockholders, including the Approval Milestone Payment which will be settled in our ordinary shares. We also now have the right to settle the Net Sales Milestone Payments in our ordinary shares, except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement.\nSubject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, 10% of the Upfront Shares, or the Holdback Shares, will serve as a source for the satisfaction of indemnification and other obligations of the former Zavante stockholders and, subject to reduction in respect of these obligations, will be issued to the former Zavante stockholders following the first anniversary of the Closing.\nIn addition, we assumed certain liabilities and obligations, including contractual liabilities and obligations, that were assumed by us upon the Closing. Prior to the Acquisition, Zavante was obligated to make milestone payments to the former stockholders of $3.0 million upon marketing approval by the FDA with respect to any oral, intravenous or other form of fosfomycin, or the Zavante Products, and milestone payments of up to $26.0 million in the aggregate upon the occurrence of various specified levels of net sales with respect to the Zavante Products. In addition, Zavante is obligated to make annual royalty payments of a mid-single-digit percentage of net sales of Zavante Products, subject to adjustment based on net sales thresholds and with such percentage reduced to low single-digits if generic fosfomycin products account for half of the applicable market on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Zavante will also pay a mid-single-digit percentage of transaction revenue in connection with the consummation of the grant, sale, license or transfer of market exclusivity rights for a qualified infectious disease product (within the meaning of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act) related to a Zavante Product.\nZavante had entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Ercros, S.A., pursuant to which Ercros, S.A. supplies to Zavante, on an exclusive basis, a blend of fosfomycin disodium and succinic acid, or API Mixture, for CONTEPO and, if CONTEPO is approved, will supply the commercial API Mixture for CONTEPO in the United State. In addition, Zavante had entered into a\nmanufacturing and supply agreement with Fisiopharma, S.r.l. pursuant to which Zavante has an obligation to purchase a minimum percentage of its commercial requirements of CONTEPO in the United States. Zavante had also entered into a manufacturing and exclusive supply agreement with Laboratorios ERN, S.A., pursuant to which Laboratorios ERN, S.A. has agreed to supply Zavante with certain technical documentation and data as required for submission of an NDA or an abbreviated new drug application for CONTEPO and certain regulatory support in connection with the commercial sale and use of CONTEPO in the United States, and which provides for payments by Zavante to Laboratorios ERN, S.A. of a one-time cash payment upon the first commercial sale of CONTEPO and subsequent quarterly payments thereafter based on the number of vials of CONTEPO sold in the United States during each quarter.\nIn connection with the closing of the Acquisition, we have assumed other agreements entered into by Zavante, including, among others, an R&D office lease, a collaboration agreement governing the supply and manufacturing agreements described above and a commercial packaging agreement.\nWe accounted for the Acquisition as an asset acquisition as the arrangement did not meet the definition of a business pursuant to the guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 805, Business Combinations. We concluded the Acquisition did not meet the definition of a business because the transaction principally resulted in the acquisition of the exclusive rights to IV fosfomycin in the U.S. which is a single identifiable asset and represents substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired.\nWe expensed the acquired intellectual property as of the acquisition date as in-process research and development with no alternative future uses. We recorded an in-process research and development expense of $32.0 million which represents $26.9 million for the fair value of the Upfront Shares, $4.9 million of transaction costs and $0.2 million of net liabilities assumed.\nLicense Agreement with Sinovant Sciences, Ltd.\nIn March 2018, we entered into a license agreement, or the Sinovant License Agreement, with Sinovant Sciences, Ltd. or Sinovant, an affiliate of Roivant Sciences, Ltd., to develop and commercialize lefamulin in the greater China region. As part of the Sinovant License Agreement, Nabriva Therapeutics Ireland DAC and Nabriva Therapeutics GmbH, our wholly owned subsidiaries, granted Sinovant an exclusive license to develop and commercialize, and a non-exclusive license to manufacture, certain products containing lefamulin, or the Licensed Products, in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, which we refer to as the Territory. We retain development and commercialization rights in the rest of the world.\nUnder the Sinovant License Agreement, Sinovant and our subsidiaries have established a joint development committee, or the JDC, to review and oversee development and commercialization plans in the Territory. We received a $5.0 million upfront payment pursuant to the terms of the Sinovant License Agreement and will be eligible for up to an additional $91.5 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestone events related to lefamulin for CABP, plus an additional $4.0 million in milestone payments if any Licensed Product receives a second or any subsequent regulatory approval in the People's Republic of China. The first milestone was a $1.5 million payment for the submission of a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, by Sinovant to the Chinese Food and Drug Administration that was received in February 2019. The remaining milestone payments are tied to additional regulatory approvals and annual sales targets. In addition, we will be eligible to receive low double-digit royalties on sales, if any, of Licensed Products in the Territory.\nSinovant will be solely responsible for all costs related to developing, obtaining regulatory approval of and commercializing Licensed Products in the Territory and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize Licensed Product in the Territory. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply, pursuant to supply agreements to be negotiated by the parties, to Sinovant sufficient supply of lefamulin for Sinovant to\nmanufacture finished drug products for development and commercialization of the Licensed Products in the Territory.\nUnless earlier terminated, the Sinovant License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last royalty term for the last Licensed Product in the Territory, which we expect will occur in 2033. Following the expiration of the last royalty term, the license granted to Sinovant will become non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free and irrevocable. The Sinovant License Agreement may be terminated in its entirety by Sinovant upon 180 days' prior written notice at any time. Either party may, subject to specified cure periods, terminate the Sinovant License Agreement in the event of the other party's uncured material breach. Either party may also terminate the Sinovant License Agreement under specified circumstances relating to the other party's insolvency. We have the right to terminate the Sinovant License Agreement immediately if Sinovant does not reach certain development milestones by certain specified dates (subject to specified cure periods). The Sinovant License Agreement contemplates that the we will enter into ancillary agreements with Sinovant, including clinical and commercial supply agreements and a pharmacovigilance agreement.\nWe have identified two performance obligations at inception: (1) the delivery of the licenses to Sinovant; and, (2) the participation in the JDC. The $5.0 million non-refundable upfront payment was allocated entirely to the delivery of the licenses as the JDC deliverable was deemed to be de minimis. In addition, since the first $1.5 million milestone payment is related to a submission of the CTA that is in the control of the parties', we recorded such milestone as variable consideration allocated to the licenses at the inception of the arrangement as we believe it is probable to be met and received. The future regulatory and commercial milestone payments will be recorded during the period the milestone is probable of achievement.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from product sales. Based on our current plans, we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, lefamulin and CONTEPO. We do not expect to obtain marketing approval for CONTEPO before April 2019 or for lefamulin before August 2019, if at all. If our development efforts result in clinical success and regulatory approval, we may also enter into collaboration agreements with third parties and we may generate revenue from those agreements.\nOur revenue consists principally of the collaboration revenues recorded from the Sinovant License Agreement, and includes a $5.0 million non-refundable upfront payment received as consideration for entering into the Sinovant License Agreement, as well as $1.5 million of variable consideration related to a milestone payment that we believe was probable to be met and was received in February of 2019. Revenue also includes governmental research premiums, non-refundable government grants and the benefit of government loans at below-market interest rates, which are more fully described below under \"Critical Accounting Policies.\"\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represented 78.0%, 62.7% and 66.3% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nFor each of our research and development programs, we incur both direct and indirect expenses. Direct expenses include third party expenses related to these programs such as expenses for manufacturing services, non-clinical and clinical studies and other third party development services. Indirect expenses include salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in research and development functions, infrastructure costs allocated to research and development\noperations, costs associated with obtaining and maintaining intellectual property associated with our research and development operations, laboratory consumables, consulting fees related to research and development activities and other overhead costs. We utilize our research and development staff and infrastructure resources across multiple programs, and many of our indirect costs historically have not been specifically attributable to a single program. Accordingly, we cannot state precisely our total indirect costs incurred on a program-by-program basis.\nThe following table summarizes our direct research and development expenses by program and our indirect costs.\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lefamulin\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>36,003 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>34,538 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>20,685 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CONTEPO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,423 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In-process research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,048 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other programs and initiatives\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Indirect costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,079 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>47,994 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>49,615 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>82,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with required regulatory activities, our activities related to our ongoing pediatric studies of lefamulin for the treatment of CABP and of CONTEPO for the treatment of cUTI, the pursuit of the clinical development of lefamulin and CONTEPO for additional indications and engagement in earlier stage research and development activities. It is difficult to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development programs.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u2022 the efficacy and potential advantages of our product candidates compared to alternative treatments, including any standard of care, and our ability to achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval;\n\u2022 the costs and timing of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing, for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval; and\n\u2022 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could result in a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we have completed or currently contemplate will be required for the completion of clinical development of any product candidate, we could be required to expend significant additional resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses represented 22.0%, 37.3% and 33.7% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation not related to research and development activities for personnel in our finance, information technology, commercial, medical affairs and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include costs related to professional fees for auditors, lawyers and tax advisors and consulting fees not related to research and development operations, as well as functions that are partly or fully outsourced by us, such as accounting, payroll processing and information technology.\nWe expect general and general administrative expenses to increase with the expansion of our staff and management team in anticipation of the commercialization of lefamulin and CONTEPO, particularly commercial, medical affairs, technical operations and business development functions\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on our limited historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this filing. However, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nResearch Premium and Grant Revenue\nAs a company that carries out research and development activities, we benefit from the Austrian research and development support regime, under which we are eligible to receive a research premium from the Austrian government equal to 12% of a specified research and development cost base. Qualifying expenditures largely comprise research and development activities conducted in Austria, however, the research premium is also available for certain related third-party expenses with additional limitations. We recorded research premiums of $6.2 million, $4.8 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. We have not received any research premium for our qualified 2018 expenditures as of December 31, 2018. We recognize the research premium, as long as we have incurred research and development expenses. Significant judgment is required in determining which expenditures are eligible to be included in the research and development costs base and such costs are subject to review by the Austrian government.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch expenses are defined as costs incurred for current or planned investigations undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. Development\nexpenses are defined as costs incurred for the application of research findings or specialist knowledge to production, production methods, services or goods prior to the commencement of commercial production or use. We expense all research and development costs as incurred.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n\u2022 vendors in connection with preclinical development activities;\n\u2022 the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials;\n\u2022 CROs in connection with clinical trials; and,\n\u2022 investigative sites in connection with clinical trials.\nImplications of Being an Emerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:\n\u2022 an exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 on the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u2022 an exemption from compliance with any requirement that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022 reduced disclosure about the company's executive compensation arrangements; and\n\u2022 exemptions from the requirements to obtain a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or a shareholder approval of any golden parachute arrangements.\nWe may take advantage of these provisions until December 31, 2020 or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earlier to occur of: the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1 billion in annual revenues (as may be inflation adjusted by the SEC from time-to-time); the date we qualify as a \"large accelerated filer,\" with at least more than $700 million in market value of our share capital held by nonaffiliates; or the issuance by us of more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available benefits under the JOBS Act. We have taken advantage of some reduced reporting burdens in this Annual Report. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of delayed adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will adopt new\nor revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required by for non-emerging growth companies.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2018\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated Operations Data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,319 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,656 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>4,337 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,615 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(82,288 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,673 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,472 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,743 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,271 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(79,087 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(124,031 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,944 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(73,768 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(114,375 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,607 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(272 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(764 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(84 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(359 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(73,001 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(114,731 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,730 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,355 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(49 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,306 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(74,356 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(114,780 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(40,424 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues increased by $4.3 million from $5.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the $5.0 million upfront payment received from our Sinovant License Agreement, as well as a $1.5 million of variable consideration related to a future milestone payment pursuant to the Sinovant License Agreement that we believe is probable to be met. Grant revenue from research premiums provided to us by the Austrian government decreased by $2.2 million as a result of a decrease in our research and development expenses for which we can receive grant revenue.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $32.7 million from $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $82.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $32.0 million increase for in-process research and development expenses associated with the acquisition of Zavante assets, a $6.5 million increase in research consulting fees, a $6.5 million increase associated with the payment of the NDA fees to the FDA for lefamulin and CONTEPO, a $1.9 million increase in staff costs due to the addition of employees, a $0.3 million increase in travel and other research and development costs, partly offset by a $13.9 million decrease in research materials and purchased services related to the development of lefamulin and a $0.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $12.3 million from $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $2.6 million increase of advisory and external consultancy expenses primarily related to pre-commercialization activities and professional service fees, a $9.6 million increase in staff costs\ndue to the addition of employees, a $0.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $1.0 million increase in other corporate costs, a $0.7 million increase in travel expenses, and a $0.4 million increase in infrastructure costs, partly offset by a $2.2 million decrease in legal fees.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net decreased by $0.8 million from $0.5 million income for the year ended December 31, 2017, to $0.3 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to re-measurements of our foreign currency account balances.\nInterest income (expense), net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net interest expense increased over the prior year due to lower interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur income tax expense was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $49,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change to income tax expense was primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in 2017.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2017\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated Operations Data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,482 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,319 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(1,163 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs and Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,994 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,615 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,621 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,535 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,472 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,937 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61,529 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(79,087 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,558 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55,047 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(73,768 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,721 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(783 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,275 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55,562 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(73,001 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,439 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>672 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,355 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,027 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(54,890 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(74,356 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(19,466 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues, consisting primarily of research premium and grant revenue, decreased by $1.2 million from $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change was primarily due to a $1.4 million decrease in grant revenue from research premiums provided to us by the Austrian government as a result of lower applicable research and development expenses, which was offset by a $0.2 million increase in grant income.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $1.6 million from $48.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was\nprimarily due to a $2.1 million increase in staff costs due to the addition of employees and a $1.2 million increase in share-based compensation expense also due to the inclusion of additional employees in our share-based compensation plan, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in direct costs for purchased services related to the development of lefamulin and a $0.2 million decrease of advisory and external consultancy, travel and other expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $16.0 million from $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $4.1 million increase in legal fees mainly related to the redomiciliation of our parent company from Austria to Ireland, a $6.1 million increase of advisory and external consultancy expenses primarily related to pre-commercialization activities and professional service fees, a $2.0 million increase in share-based compensation expense due to the inclusion of additional employees in our share-based compensation plan, a $2.8 million increase in staff costs due to the addition of employees, a $0.7 million increase in VAT tax expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in support, infrastructure and other corporate costs.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net increased by $1.3 million from a net expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to net income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to re-measurements of our foreign currency account balances.\nInterest expense, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income was relatively flat compared to the same period in 2016.\nIncome tax (Expense) Benefit\nOur income tax expense was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The year over year change was primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in our foreign subsidiaries. Our income tax (expense) benefit includes Irish, Austrian and U.S. income taxes at statutory rates and the effects of various permanent differences.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and generated negative cash flows from our operations. To date, we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities, including our initial public offering, public follow-on offerings and private placements of our equity securities, convertible and term debt financings, payments from a collaboration partner and research and development support from governmental grants and loans.\nIn December 2018, we announced the closing of up to a $75.0 million term loan with Hercules, or the Loan Agreement, $25.0 million of which was funded on the day of closing. Under the terms of the loan, in addition to the $25.0 million received at closing, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $15.0 million in two tranches upon the approval by the FDA of the NDAs recently submitted for lefamulin and CONTEPO. We will also be eligible to receive an additional $30.0 million of aggregate term loan advances in three separate tranches upon the achievement of specified product revenue milestones. These additional tranches are at our discretion and may only be drawn upon during specified periods of time. The final $5.0 million tranche is available through December 31, 2021, subject to the lenders' sole discretion. We are entitled to make interest-only payments through July 1,\n2020, with incremental extensions through January 1, 2022 upon the achievement of specified performance milestones. We are required to repay the term loan after the interest only period based on a monthly amortization schedule, with a final maturity date occurring on June 1, 2023. The term loan bears interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of 9.80% and 9.80% plus the prime rate of interest minus 5.50%. The Loan Agreement provides for interest-only payments through July 1, 2020, which may be incrementally extended from time to time upon the occurrence of certain conditions through January 1, 2022, and repayment of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loan thereafter in monthly installments through June 1, 2023. In addition, we are required to pay a fee of 6.95% of the aggregate amount of advances under the Loan Agreement at maturity. At our option, we may elect to prepay any portion of the outstanding term loan that is greater than or equal to $5.0 million by paying such portion of the principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus a prepayment charge equal to the following percentage of the principal amount being prepaid: (i) 3.0% if the term loan is prepaid during the first 12 months following the initial closing, (ii) 2.0% if the term loan is prepaid after 12 months following the initial closing but before 24 months following the initial closing and (iii) 1.0% if the term loan is prepaid any time thereafter but prior to the final maturity date. We are also required to satisfy certain financial covenants, including an obligation to maintain specified minimum amounts of cash and cash equivalents in accounts pledged to Hercules.\nIn July 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 18,181,818 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $2.75 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $50.0 million and net proceeds to us of $46.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nIn March 2018, we entered into a sales agreement, or the ATM Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, pursuant to which, from time to time, we may offer and sell our ordinary shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through Cantor pursuant to an effective universal shelf registration statement. Sales of our ordinary shares, if any, under the agreement with Cantor may be made in sales deemed to be an \"at-the-market offering\" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as

in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flow provided by investing activities decreased by $54.4 million from $49.7 million of cash provided for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $4.6 million cash used for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a $51.0 million decrease in proceeds from sale of available-for-sale financial assets to fund

Activities\nCash flow utilized by operating activities increased by $21.0 million from $48.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to a $16.1 million increase in net loss, after adjustments for non-cash amounts included in net loss and higher working capital of $4.9 million primarily due to changes in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flow provided by investing activities increased by $26.4 million from $23.4 million cash inflow in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $49.7 million cash inflow in the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase of $15.0 million in proceeds from sale of available-for-sale securities to fund operational cash out flows and a decrease of $57.0 million in purchases of available-for\nsale-securities in 2017. The year over year increase in investing activities was partially offset by a $45.0 million decrease in proceeds from maturities of term deposits.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flow provided by financing activities increased by $49.9 million from $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the gross proceeds of $80.0 million from our 2017 equity financing, compared to the proceeds of $24.8 million from our rights offering and related underwritten offering in December 2016. The year-over-year increase in financing cash inflows was partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in equity transaction costs.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe anticipate that our expenses will increase as we continue to invest in critical pre-commercialization activities prior to obtaining marketing approval for lefamulin and CONTEPO. If we obtain marketing approval for lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, in-license or acquire, we expect to incur significant additional commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. In addition, our expenses will increase if we suffer any regulatory delays or are required to conduct additional clinical trials to satisfy regulatory requirements.\nIn addition, our expenses will increase if and as we:\n\u2022 initiate or continue the research and development of lefamulin and CONTEPO for additional indications and of our other product candidates;\n\u2022 seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022 seek marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical development;\n\u2022 continue to establish a medical affairs, sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and build up inventory of finished product and its components to commercialize any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022 in-license or acquire other products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 establish and expand manufacturing arrangements with third parties;\n\u2022 Draw additional funds under the Loan Agreement with Hercules;\n\u2022 expand our physical presence in the United States and Ireland; and,\n\u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development, our operations as a public company and our planned commercialization efforts.\nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2018, proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares under the our ATM Agreement of $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2019, as well as a $1.5 million milestone payment received in February 2019 under our license agreement with Sinovant Sciences, Ltd., and research premiums from the Austrian government for our qualified research and development expenditures, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2020. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. This estimate assumes, among other\nthings, that we do not obtain any additional funding through grants and clinical trial support, collaboration agreements, equity or debt financings, including additional advances under the Loan Agreement with Hercules. We may be eligible to borrow up an additional $50.0 million under our Loan Agreement with Hercules if we achieve specified regulatory and product revenue milestones, including $10.0 million that we will be eligible to borrow upon the approval by the FDA of an NDA for lefamulin and $5.0 million that we will be eligible to borrow upon the approval by the FDA of an NDA for CONTEPO.\nWe expect to seek additional funding in future periods for purposes of investment in our commercial and medical affairs organization, as well as investing in our supply chain, in an effort to enhance the potential commercial launch of lefamulin and CONTEPO.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022 the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up activities associated with lefamulin and CONTEPO;\n\u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of lefamulin and CONTEPO;\n\u2022 the costs of commercialization activities for lefamulin and CONTEPO if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and outsourced manufacturing capabilities, including the costs of building finished product inventory and its components in preparation of initial marketing of lefamulin and CONTEPO;\n\u2022 subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue received from commercial sales of lefamulin and CONTEPO;\n\u2022 the costs of developing lefamulin and CONTEPO for the treatment of additional indications;\n\u2022 our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of product development of any other product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022 the continued availability of Austrian governmental grants;\n\u2022 the need to satisfy interest and principal obligations in our debt facility;\n\u2022 the rate of the expansion of our physical presence in the United States and Ireland; and\n\u2022 the costs of operating as a public company in the United States.\nConducting clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other products that we successfully develop, in-license or acquire, none of which are yet commercially available. In addition, if approved, lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, in-license or acquire may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, and funding from local and international government entities and non-government organizations in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $1.2 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. We made no significant investments in intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Currently, there are no material capital projects planned in 2019.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules, other than our operating lease obligations for our facilities in Austria, Ireland and the United States.", "item_7_truncated": "For each of our research and development programs, we incur both direct and indirect expenses. Direct expenses include third party expenses related to these programs such as expenses for manufacturing services, non-clinical and clinical studies and other third party development services. Indirect expenses include salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in research and development functions, infrastructure costs allocated to research and development\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year

Past efforts to \"cast the widest net possible\" with broad-spectrum antibiotics that affect many types of bacteria have caused problems, such as C. difficile infections, by killing good bacteria or increased antibiotic resistance in other bacteria in different areas of the body. Additionally, in 2016, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, or IDSA/SHEA, updated their Antibiotic Stewardship guidelines for antibiotic use. We believe that three key goals from these guidelines are applicable to the treatment of CABP:\n\u2022 Draw additional funds under the Loan Agreement with Hercules;\nCapital expenditures were $1.2 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. We made no significant investments in intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Currently, there are no material capital projects planned in 2019.\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and generated negative cash flows from our operations. To date, we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities, including our initial public offering, public follow-on offerings and private placements of our equity securities, convertible and term debt financings, payments from a collaboration partner and research and development support from governmental grants and loans.\n\u2022 complicated intra-abdominal infections, or cIAI\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018:\nResearch expenses are defined as costs incurred for current or planned investigations undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.

We were notified by the FDA that CONTEPO IV and both formulations of lefamulin were granted Priority Review following acceptance of the NDAs. We currently have a team of regional business directors and medical science liaisons in the field performing educational and market development activities. We plan to use a targeted hospital-based sales force to promote both lefamulin formulations and CONTEPO, if approved.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2017\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u2022 an exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 on the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u2022 continue to establish a medical affairs, sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and build up inventory of finished product and its components to commercialize any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\nInterest income (expense), net\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules, other than our operating lease obligations for our facilities in Austria, Ireland and the United States.\n\u2022 the efficacy and potential advantages of our product candidates compared to alternative treatments, including any standard of care, and our ability to achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval;\nOther Income (Expense), net\nCapital Expenditures\nUpon the closing of the Acquisition, or the Closing, we issued 7,336,906 of our ordinary shares to former Zavante stockholders, which together with the 815,186 ordinary shares that are issuable upon release of the Holdback Shares (as defined below) constitute approximately 19.9% of our ordinary shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing, or the Upfront Shares.\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represented 78.0%, 62.7% and 66.3% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims.\nWe have identified two performance obligations at inception: (1) the delivery of the licenses to Sinovant; and, (2) the participation in the JDC. The $5.0 million non-refundable upfront payment was allocated entirely to the delivery of the licenses as the JDC deliverable was deemed to be de minimis. In addition, since the first $1.5 million milestone payment is related to a submission of the CTA that is in the control of the parties', we recorded such milestone as variable consideration allocated to the licenses at the inception of the arrangement as we believe it is probable to be met and received. The future regulatory and commercial milestone payments will be recorded during the period the milestone is probable of achievement.\nRevenues\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\u2022 our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nThe FDA has designated CONTEPO as a QIDP and granted Fast Track designations to CONTEPO under the GAIN Act for:\nOur revenue consists principally of the collaboration revenues recorded from the Sinovant License Agreement, and includes a $5.0 million non-refundable upfront payment received as consideration for entering into the Sinovant License Agreement, as well as $1.5 million of variable consideration related to a milestone payment that we believe was probable to be met and was received in February of 2019. Revenue also includes governmental research premiums, non-refundable government grants and the benefit of government loans at below-market interest rates, which are more fully described below under \"Critical Accounting Policies.\"\nAlthough we have no current plans to finance development of CONTEPO for indications other than cUTI, including AP, these designations make CONTEPO eligible for Fast Track and Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, incentives. We may in the future consider additional non-dilutive financing options to advance these programs in the clinic.\nSinovant will be solely responsible for all costs related to developing, obtaining regulatory approval of and commercializing Licensed Products in the Territory and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize Licensed Product in the Territory. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply, pursuant to supply agreements to be negotiated by the parties, to Sinovant sufficient supply of lefamulin for Sinovant to\n\u2022 Reduce antibiotic therapy to the shortest effective duration.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will increase as we continue to invest in critical pre-commercialization activities prior to obtaining marketing approval for lefamulin and CONTEPO. If we obtain marketing approval for lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, in-license or acquire, we expect to incur significant additional commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. In addition, our expenses will increase if we suffer any regulatory delays or are required to conduct additional clinical trials to satisfy regulatory requirements.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2017\nWe believe that the ZEUS Study results, along with extensive clinical experience with IV fosfomycin for over 45 years outside the United States, support CONTEPO as a potential first-line treatment for cUTI suspected to be caused by MDR pathogens in the United States. A number of studies report that at least 20% of cUTIs are caused by MDR bacteria and limited treatment options are available in the United States. In addition, non-clinical data have shown that CONTEPO acts in combination with certain other antibiotics to improve bacterial killing.\nUnless earlier terminated, the Sinovant License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last royalty term for the last Licensed Product in the Territory, which we expect will occur in 2033. Following the expiration of the last royalty term, the license granted to Sinovant will become non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free and irrevocable. The Sinovant License Agreement may be terminated in its entirety by Sinovant upon 180 days' prior written notice at any time. Either party may, subject to specified cure periods, terminate the Sinovant License Agreement in the event of the other party's uncured material breach. Either party may also terminate the Sinovant License Agreement under specified circumstances relating to the other party's insolvency. We have the right to terminate the Sinovant License Agreement immediately if Sinovant does not reach certain development milestones by certain specified dates (subject to specified cure periods). The Sinovant License Agreement contemplates that the we will enter into ancillary agreements with Sinovant, including clinical and commercial supply agreements and a pharmacovigilance agreement.\nOperating Activities\n\u2022 the costs of developing lefamulin and CONTEPO for the treatment of additional indications;\nAt our Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held in October 2018, our shareholders approved the issuance of ordinary shares in settlement of potential milestone payment obligations that may become payable in the future to former Zavante stockholders, including the Approval Milestone Payment which will be settled in our ordinary shares. We also now have the right to settle the Net Sales Milestone Payments in our ordinary shares, except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement.\nConducting clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other products that we successfully develop, in-license or acquire, none of which are yet commercially available. In addition, if approved, lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, in-license or acquire may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nFinancing Activities\nAcquisition of Zavante\n\u2022 vendors in connection with preclinical development activities;\n\u2022 in-license or acquire other products, product candidates or technologies;\nWe expensed the acquired intellectual property as of the acquisition date as in-process research and development with no alternative future uses. We recorded an in-process research and development expense of $32.0 million which represents $26.9 million for the fair value of the Upfront Shares, $4.9 million of transaction costs and $0.2 million of net liabilities assumed.\nCONTEPO (fosfomycin for injection) is a novel, potentially first-in-class investigational intravenous antibiotic in the United States with a broad spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram-positive activity, including activity against most contemporary MDR strains such as ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. CONTEPO inhibits the bacteria's ability to form a normal cell wall, which is critical for the cell's survival and growth. It works at an earlier and different stage of cell wall synthesis than other injectable antibiotics, differentiating its mechanism of action from approved injectable antibiotics. CONTEPO utilizes a dosing approach developed by Zavante for the United States that is designed to optimize its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in order to improve treatment outcomes.\nIn March 2018, we entered into a license agreement, or the Sinovant License Agreement, with Sinovant Sciences, Ltd. or Sinovant, an affiliate of Roivant Sciences, Ltd., to develop and commercialize lefamulin in the greater China region. As part of the Sinovant License Agreement, Nabriva Therapeutics Ireland DAC and Nabriva Therapeutics GmbH, our wholly owned subsidiaries, granted Sinovant an exclusive license to develop and commercialize, and a non-exclusive license to manufacture, certain products containing lefamulin, or the Licensed Products, in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, which we refer to as the Territory. We retain development and commercialization rights in the rest of the world.\n\nOur income tax expense was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The year over year change was primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in our foreign subsidiaries. Our income tax (expense) benefit includes Irish, Austrian and U.S. income taxes at statutory rates and the effects of various permanent differences.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could result in a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we have completed or currently contemplate will be required for the completion of clinical development of any product candidate, we could be required to expend significant additional resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.\n\u2022 the costs of operating as a public company in the United States.\n\u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of lefamulin and CONTEPO;\nor revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required by for non-emerging growth companies.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2018\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income was relatively flat compared to the same period in 2016.\ngenerally well-tolerated safety profile. We believe lefamulin represents a potentially important new treatment option for the five to six million adults in the United States diagnosed with CABP each year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation not related to research and development activities for personnel in our finance, information technology, commercial, medical affairs and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include costs related to professional fees for auditors, lawyers and tax advisors and consulting fees not related to research and development operations, as well as functions that are partly or fully outsourced by us, such as accounting, payroll processing and information technology.\n\n\u2022 the need to satisfy interest and principal obligations in our debt facility;\noperations, costs associated with obtaining and maintaining intellectual property associated with our research and development operations, laboratory consumables, consulting fees related to research and development activities and other overhead costs. We utilize our research and development staff and infrastructure resources across multiple programs, and many of our indirect costs historically have not been specifically attributable to a single program. Accordingly, we cannot state precisely our total indirect costs incurred on a program-by-program basis.\n\u2022 the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials;\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022 the continued availability of Austrian governmental grants;\nAs a result of increasing resistance to antibiotics and the wide array of potential pathogens that cause CABP, the current standard of care for hospitalized patients with CABP whose treatment is initiated in the hospital usually involves first-line empiric treatment with a combination of antibiotics (beta-lactams and macrolides) to address all likely bacterial pathogens or monotherapy with a fluoroquinolone. Combination therapy presents the logistical challenge of administering multiple drugs with different dosing regimens, with some drugs available only as IV, and increases the risk of drug-drug interactions and the potential for serious side effects. Fluoroquinolones are associated with safety and tolerability concerns, including a relatively high risk for developing Clostridium difficile infection and increasing rates of resistance for uropathogens. We believe these concerns have resulted in a decreasing use of fluoroquinolones and restriction of their use within a growing number of hospitals. In addition, in May 2016, the FDA announced that an FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones, when used systemically, in the form of tablets, capsules and injectable, are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects that can occur together. These side effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system. Fluoroquinolones are typically administered in combination with other antibiotics, if community-acquired MRSA is suspected. In addition, many currently available antibiotic therapies are only available for IV administration and are prescribed for seven to fourteen days, meaning continued treatment requires prolonged hospitalization or a switch to a different antibiotic administered orally, with the attendant risk that the patient might respond differently.\nThe CONTEPO development program has focused on obtaining marketing approval in the United States for the treatment of cUTIs, including AP. In April 2017, Zavante announced the results of the pivotal ZEUS Study, in which CONTEPO met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority versus PIP-TAZ. Zavante then met with the FDA in the second half of 2017 to discuss the filing of an NDA for CONTEPO. We submitted an NDA for marketing approval of CONTEPO for the treatment of cUTI in adults in the United States, to the FDA in October 2018. The FDA has granted us PDUFA target action date of April 30, 2019 for CONTEPO.\nIncome tax (Expense) Benefit\nResearch and development expenses increased by $1.6 million from $48.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

IV fosfomycin has been approved for a number of indications and utilized for over 45 years in Europe to treat a variety of serious bacterial infections, including cUTIs. CONTEPO utilizes a new dosing regimen that optimize its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We believe these attributes, the extensive clinical experience worldwide and the positive efficacy and safety results from the Phase 2/3 clinical trial support CONTEPO as a first-line treatment for cUTIs, including acute pyelonephritis, or AP, suspected to be caused by MDR pathogens. At least 20% of cUTIs are caused by MDR bacteria and limited treatment options are available in the U.S. In addition, non-clinical data have shown that CONTEPO acts in combination with certain other antibiotics to improve bacterial killing.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCash Flows\nIn recognition of the growing need for the development of new antibiotics, recent regulatory changes, including Priority Review and regulatory guidance enabling smaller clinical trials, have led to renewed interest from the pharmaceutical industry in anti-infective development. For example, the FDA Safety and Innovation Act became law in 2012 and included the GAIN Act, which provides incentives, including access to expedited FDA review for approval, Fast Track designation and five years of potential data exclusivity extension for the development of new QIDPs.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on our limited historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that pleuromutilin antibiotics can help address the major public health threat posed by bacterial resistance, which the World Health Organization, or WHO, characterized in 2017 as one of the biggest threats to human health. Increasing resistance to antibiotics used to treat CABP is a growing concern and has become an issue in selecting the appropriate initial antibiotic treatment prior to determining the specific microbiological cause of the infection, referred to as empiric treatment. For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, has classified Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common respiratory pathogen, as a serious threat to human health as a result of\nRevenues increased by $4.3 million from $5.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the $5.0 million upfront payment received from our Sinovant License Agreement, as well as a $1.5 million of variable consideration related to a future milestone payment pursuant to the Sinovant License Agreement that we believe is probable to be met. Grant revenue from research premiums provided to us by the Austrian government decreased by $2.2 million as a result of a decrease in our research and development expenses for which we can receive grant revenue.\nIn addition, our expenses will increase if and as we:\nOn March 1, 2017, Nabriva Therapeutics plc, or Nabriva Ireland, was incorporated in Ireland under the name Hyacintho 2 plc, and was renamed to Nabriva Therapeutics plc on April 10, 2017, in order to effectuate the change of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the ultimate company of the group from Austria to Ireland. Nabriva Ireland replaced Nabriva Therapeutics AG, or Nabriva Austria, as the ultimate parent company on June 23, 2017, following the conclusion of a tender offer, or the Exchange Offer, in which holders of 98.6% of the outstanding share capital of Nabriva Austria exchanged their holdings for ordinary shares, $0.01 nominal value per share, of Nabriva Ireland, which\nincreasing resistance to currently available antibiotics. In addition, the CDC recently reported on the growing evidence of widespread resistance to macrolides, widely used antibiotics that disrupt bacterial protein synthesis, in Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common cause of CABP that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or MRSA, which has also been designated as a serious threat to human health by the CDC, has emerged as a more common cause of CABP in some regions of the world, and a possible pathogen to be covered with empiric therapy.\nIn March 2018, we entered into a sales agreement, or the ATM Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, pursuant to which, from time to time, we may offer and sell our ordinary shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through Cantor pursuant to an effective universal shelf registration statement. Sales of our ordinary shares, if any, under the agreement with Cantor may be made in sales deemed to be an \"at-the-market offering\" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nCash flow provided by financing activities increased by $49.9 million from $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the gross proceeds of $80.0 million from our 2017 equity financing, compared to the proceeds of $24.8 million from our rights offering and related underwritten offering in December 2016.

As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $394.0 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through our 2018 equity offering, our term loan, our \"at-the-market\" offering facility, our 2017 equity offering, our 2016 rights offering, our 2015 initial public offering, private placements of our equity securities, convertible loans and research and development support from governmental grants and loans. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials.

The increase was primarily due to a $32.0 million increase for in-process research and development expenses associated with the acquisition of Zavante assets, a $6.5 million increase in research consulting fees, a $6.5 million increase associated with the payment of the NDA fees to the FDA for lefamulin and CONTEPO, a $1.9 million increase in staff costs due to the addition of employees, a $0.3 million increase in travel and other research and development costs, partly offset by a $13.9 million decrease in research materials and purchased services related to the development of lefamulin and a $0.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this filing. However, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nCash flow utilized by operating activities increased by $21.0 million from $48.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to a $16.1 million increase in net loss, after adjustments for non-cash amounts included in net loss and higher working capital of $4.9 million primarily due to changes in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nIn December 2018, we announced the closing of up to a $75.0 million term loan with Hercules, or the Loan Agreement, $25.0 million of which was funded on the day of closing. Under the terms of the loan, in addition to the $25.0 million received at closing, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $15.0 million in two tranches upon the approval by the FDA of the NDAs recently submitted for lefamulin and CONTEPO. We will also be eligible to receive an additional $30.0 million of aggregate term loan advances in three separate tranches upon the achievement of specified product revenue milestones. These additional tranches are at our discretion and may only be drawn upon during specified periods of time. The final $5.0 million tranche is available through December 31, 2021, subject to the lenders' sole discretion. We are entitled to make interest-only payments through July 1,\nIn December 2016, we completed a rights offering and a related underwritten offering for the sale of an aggregate of 588,127 common shares resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $24.8 million and net proceeds to us of $20.6 million, after deducting underwriting fees and offering expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses represented 22.0%, 37.3% and 33.7% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel anti-infective agents to treat serious infections. We have two product candidates that have been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for approval: lefamulin, potentially the first pleuromutilin antibiotic available for oral and intravenous (or IV) administration in humans, for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP and CONTEPO, a potentially first-in-class epoxide antibiotic for intravenous (or IV) use in the United States for complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTI. We may potentially develop lefamulin and CONTEPO for additional indications. Both lefamulin formulations and CONTEPO were granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, and Fast Track designation by the FDA, enabling Priority Review of the New Drug Applications, or the NDAs by the FDA.\n\u2022 the costs and timing of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing, for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval; and\nwe refer to as the Redomiciliation Transaction. The ordinary shares of Nabriva Ireland were issued on a one-for-ten basis to the holders of the Nabriva Austria common shares and on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the Nabriva Austria American Depositary Shares, or Nabriva Austria ADSs, participating in the Exchange Offer. On June 26, 2017, the ordinary shares of Nabriva Ireland began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \"NBRV,\" the same symbol under which the Nabriva Austria ADSs were previously traded. This transaction was accounted for as a merger between entities under common control; accordingly, the historical financial statements of Nabriva Austria for periods prior to this transaction are considered to be the historical financial statements of Nabriva Ireland. As of August 18, 2017, 100% of Nabriva Austria share capital had been exchanged for ordinary shares of Nabriva Ireland.\nResearch Premium and Grant Revenue\n\u2022 the rate of the expansion of our physical presence in the United States and Ireland; and\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, former Zavante stockholders and other equity holders, in the aggregate and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, will also be entitled to receive from us up to $97.5 million in contingent consideration, of which $25.0 million would become payable upon the first approval of an NDA from the the FDA for fosfomycin for injection for any indication, or the Approval Milestone Payment, and an aggregate of up to $72.5 million would become payable upon the achievement of specified sales milestones, or the Net Sales Milestone Payments.\n\u2022 exemptions from the requirements to obtain a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or a shareholder approval of any golden parachute arrangements.\nRevenues\n\u2022 acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, or ABSSSI\nUnder the Sinovant License Agreement, Sinovant and our subsidiaries have established a joint development committee, or the JDC, to review and oversee development and commercialization plans in the Territory. We received a $5.0 million upfront payment pursuant to the terms of the Sinovant License Agreement and will be eligible for up to an additional $91.5 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestone events related to lefamulin for CABP, plus an additional $4.0 million in milestone payments if any Licensed Product receives a second or any subsequent regulatory approval in the People's Republic of China. The first milestone was a $1.5 million payment for the submission of a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, by Sinovant to the Chinese Food and Drug Administration that was received in February 2019. The remaining milestone payments are tied to additional regulatory approvals and annual sales targets. In addition, we will be eligible to receive low double-digit royalties on sales, if any, of Licensed Products in the Territory.\nOn July 24, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Zavante Therapeutics, Inc., or Zavante, a privately-held late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies to improve the outcomes of hospitalized patients. Zavante's lead product candidate is CONTEPOTM (fosfomycin for injection, previously referred to as ZTI-01 and ZOLYD).\nOverview\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017:\nAs a company that carries out research and development activities, we benefit from the Austrian research and development support regime, under which we are eligible to receive a research premium from the Austrian government equal to 12% of a specified research and development cost base. Qualifying expenditures largely comprise research and development activities conducted in Austria, however, the research premium is also available for certain related third-party expenses with additional limitations. We recorded research premiums of $6.2 million, $4.8 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. We have not received any research premium for our qualified 2018 expenditures as of December 31, 2018. We recognize the research premium, as long as we have incurred research and development expenses. Significant judgment is required in determining which expenditures are eligible to be included in the research and development costs base and such costs are subject to review by the Austrian government.\nIn September 2017 we completed an underwritten public offering of 9,411,765 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $8.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $80.0 million and net proceeds to us of $73.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nIn connection with the closing of the Acquisition, we have assumed other agreements entered into by Zavante, including, among others, an R&D office lease, a collaboration agreement governing the supply and manufacturing agreements described above and a commercial packaging agreement.\nCash flow provided by investing activities increased by $26.4 million from $23.4 million cash inflow in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $49.7 million cash inflow in the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase of $15.0 million in proceeds from sale of available-for-sale securities to fund operational cash out flows and a decrease of $57.0 million in purchases of available-for\n\u2022 subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue received from commercial sales of lefamulin and CONTEPO;\nInterest expense, net\nexpenses are defined as costs incurred for the application of research findings or specialist knowledge to production, production methods, services or goods prior to the commencement of commercial production or use. We expense all research and development costs as incurred.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $12.3 million from $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $2.6 million increase of advisory and external consultancy expenses primarily related to pre-commercialization activities and professional service fees, a $9.6 million increase in staff costs\n\u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022 initiate or continue the research and development of lefamulin and CONTEPO for additional indications and of our other product candidates;\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, and funding from local and international government entities and non-government organizations in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nprimarily due to a $2.1 million increase in staff costs due to the addition of employees and a $1.2 million increase in share-based compensation expense also due to the inclusion of additional employees in our share-based compensation plan, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in direct costs for purchased services related to the development of lefamulin and a $0.2 million decrease of advisory and external consultancy, travel and other expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nLefamulin is a semi-synthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic discovered and developed by our team with the potential to be first-in-class for IV and oral in humans. It inhibits the synthesis of bacterial protein, which is required for bacteria to grow by binding with high affinity, high specificity and at molecular targets that are different than other antibiotic classes. Based on results from two global, Phase 3 clinical trials, we believe that lefamulin is well-positioned for use as a first-line monotherapy for the treatment of CABP due to its novel mechanism of action, targeted spectrum of activity, resistance profile, achievement of substantial drug concentration in lung tissue and fluid, availability of oral and IV formulations and a\nIncome Tax Expense\nthings, that we do not obtain any additional funding through grants and clinical trial support, collaboration agreements, equity or debt financings, including additional advances under the Loan Agreement with Hercules. We may be eligible to borrow up an additional $50.0 million under our Loan Agreement with Hercules if we achieve specified regulatory and product revenue milestones, including $10.0 million that we will be eligible to borrow upon the approval by the FDA of an NDA for lefamulin and $5.0 million that we will be eligible to borrow upon the approval by the FDA of an NDA for CONTEPO.\nCash flow provided by investing activities decreased by $54.4 million from $49.7 million of cash provided for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $4.6 million cash used for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a $51.0 million decrease in proceeds from sale of available-for-sale financial assets to fund operational cash outflows and $4.3 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of Zavante assets.\nobtain marketing approval for CONTEPO before April 2019 or for lefamulin before August 2019, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization effort.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from product sales. Based on our current plans, we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, lefamulin and CONTEPO. We do not expect to obtain marketing approval for CONTEPO before April 2019 or for lefamulin before August 2019, if at all.

The year over year increase in investing activities was partially offset by a $45.0 million decrease in proceeds from maturities of term deposits.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net interest expense increased over the prior year due to lower interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following table summarizes our direct research and development expenses by program and our indirect costs.\nIn July 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 18,181,818 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $2.75 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $50.0 million and net proceeds to us of $46.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\n2020, with incremental extensions through January 1, 2022 upon the achievement of specified performance milestones. We are required to repay the term loan after the interest only period based on a monthly amortization schedule, with a final maturity date occurring on June 1, 2023. The term loan bears interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of 9.80% and 9.80% plus the prime rate of interest minus 5.50%. The Loan Agreement provides for interest-only payments through July 1, 2020, which may be incrementally extended from time to time upon the occurrence of certain conditions through January 1, 2022, and repayment of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loan thereafter in monthly installments through June 1, 2023. In addition, we are required to pay a fee of 6.95% of the aggregate amount of advances under the Loan Agreement at maturity. At our option, we may elect to prepay any portion of the outstanding term loan that is greater than or equal to $5.0 million by paying such portion of the principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus a prepayment charge equal to the following percentage of the principal amount being prepaid: (i) 3.0% if the term loan is prepaid during the first 12 months following the initial closing, (ii) 2.0% if the term loan is prepaid after 12 months following the initial closing but before 24 months following the initial closing and (iii) 1.0% if the term loan is prepaid any time thereafter but prior to the final maturity date. We are also required to satisfy certain financial covenants, including an obligation to maintain specified minimum amounts of cash and cash equivalents in accounts pledged to Hercules.\nNabriva Austria was incorporated in October 2005 in Austria under the name Nabriva Therapeutics Forschungs GmbH, a limited liability company organized under Austrian law, as a spin-off from Sandoz GmbH and commenced operations in February 2006. In 2007, Nabriva Austria transformed into a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) under the name Nabriva Therapeutics AG. On October 19, 2017, Nabriva Austria was converted into a limited liability company under Austrian law and renamed Nabriva Therapeutics GmbH. In 2014, we established our wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, which began operations in August 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $16.0 million from $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $4.1 million increase in legal fees mainly related to the redomiciliation of our parent company from Austria to Ireland, a $6.1 million increase of advisory and external consultancy expenses primarily related to pre-commercialization activities and professional service fees, a $2.0 million increase in share-based compensation expense due to the inclusion of additional employees in our share-based compensation plan, a $2.8 million increase in staff costs due to the addition of employees, a $0.7 million increase in VAT tax expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in support, infrastructure and other corporate costs.\nOther income (expense), net\n\u2022 seek marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical development;\nResults of Operations\n\u2022 Reduce the risk of antibiotics associated with a high risk of C. difficile infections;\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nIn addition, we assumed certain liabilities and obligations, including contractual liabilities and obligations, that were assumed by us upon the Closing. Prior to the Acquisition, Zavante was obligated to make milestone payments to the former stockholders of $3.0 million upon marketing approval by the FDA with respect to any oral, intravenous or other form of fosfomycin, or the Zavante Products, and milestone payments of up to $26.0 million in the aggregate upon the occurrence of various specified levels of net sales with respect to the Zavante Products. In addition, Zavante is obligated to make annual royalty payments of a mid-single-digit percentage of net sales of Zavante Products, subject to adjustment based on net sales thresholds and with such percentage reduced to low single-digits if generic fosfomycin products account for half of the applicable market on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Zavante will also pay a mid-single-digit percentage of transaction revenue in connection with the consummation of the grant, sale, license or transfer of market exclusivity rights for a qualified infectious disease product (within the meaning of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act) related to a Zavante Product.\n\u2022 an exemption from compliance with any requirement that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\nIn December 2018, we announced the closing of up to a $75.0 million term loan with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, $25.0 million of which was funded on the day of closing. Under the terms of the loan, in addition to the $25.0 million received at closing, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $15.0 million in two tranches upon the approval by the FDA of the NDAs recently submitted for lefamulin and CONTEPO. We will also be eligible to receive an additional $30.0 million of aggregate term loan advances in three separate tranches upon the achievement of specified product revenue milestones. These additional tranches are at our discretion and may only be drawn upon during specified periods of time. The final $5.0 million tranche is available through December 31, 2021, subject to Hercules' sole discretion. We are entitled to make interest-only payments through July 1, 2020, with incremental extensions through January 1, 2022 upon the achievement of specified performance milestones.

The NDA submission is utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and is supported by a robust data package, including a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial (known as ZEUSTM), which met its primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority to piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with cUTI, including AP. We submitted two NDAs to the FDA for the oral and IV formulations of lefamulin for the treatment of CABP in December 2018. The FDA has granted us a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date of April 30, 2019 for CONTEPO and a PDUFA target action date of August 19, 2019 for lefamulin. We plan to submit a marketing authorization application for lefamulin in Europe in the first half of 2019. The two NDAs are supported by two pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trials (known as LEAP 1 and LEAP 2) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of IV and oral lefamulin compared to moxifloxacin in the treatment of adults with CABP, including the option to switch from IV to oral administration and a short course oral treatment with lefamulin. In both LEAP 1 and LEAP 2, lefamulin was demonstrated to be non-inferior to moxifloxacin, and met both the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for the treatment of CABP. Lefamulin was also shown to be generally well-tolerated when administered either orally or intravenously.\nOur expenses will increase if we suffer any regulatory delays or are required to conduct additional clinical trials to satisfy regulatory requirements. If we obtain marketing approval for lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, in-license or acquire, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing.\nInvesting Activities\nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2018, proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares under the our ATM Agreement of $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2019, as well as a $1.5 million milestone payment received in February 2019 under our license agreement with Sinovant Sciences, Ltd., and research premiums from the Austrian government for our qualified research and development expenditures, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2020.

Past efforts to \"cast the widest net possible\" with broad-spectrum antibiotics that affect many types of bacteria have caused problems, such as C. difficile infections, by killing good bacteria or increased antibiotic resistance in other bacteria in different areas of the body. Additionally, in 2016, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, or IDSA/SHEA, updated their Antibiotic Stewardship guidelines for antibiotic use. We believe that three key goals from these guidelines are applicable to the treatment of CABP:\n\u2022 Draw additional funds under the Loan Agreement with Hercules;\nCapital expenditures were $1.2 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. We made no significant investments in intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Currently, there are no material capital projects planned in 2019.\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and generated negative cash flows from our operations. To date, we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities, including our initial public offering, public follow-on offerings and private placements of our equity securities, convertible and term debt financings, payments from a collaboration partner and research and development support from governmental grants and loans.\n\u2022 complicated intra-abdominal infections, or cIAI\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018:\nResearch expenses are defined as costs incurred for current or planned investigations undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. Development\nBoth lefamulin formulations and CONTEPO were granted QIDP and Fast Track designation by the FDA, enabling potential Priority Review of the NDAs by the FDA. We were notified by the FDA that CONTEPO IV and both formulations of lefamulin were granted Priority Review following acceptance of the NDAs. We currently have a team of regional business directors and medical science liaisons in the field performing educational and market development activities. We plan to use a targeted hospital-based sales force to promote both lefamulin formulations and CONTEPO, if approved.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2017\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u2022 an exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 on the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u2022 continue to establish a medical affairs, sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and build up inventory of finished product and its components to commercialize any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\nInterest income (expense), net\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules, other than our operating lease obligations for our facilities in Austria, Ireland and the United States.\n\u2022 the efficacy and potential advantages of our product candidates compared to alternative treatments, including any standard of care, and our ability to achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval;\nOther Income (Expense), net\nCapital Expenditures\nUpon the closing of the Acquisition, or the Closing, we issued 7,336,906 of our ordinary shares to former Zavante stockholders, which together with the 815,186 ordinary shares that are issuable upon release of the Holdback Shares (as defined below) constitute approximately 19.9% of our ordinary shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing, or the Upfront Shares.\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represented 78.0%, 62.7% and 66.3% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims.\nWe have identified two performance obligations at inception: (1) the delivery of the licenses to Sinovant; and, (2) the participation in the JDC. The $5.0 million non-refundable upfront payment was allocated entirely to the delivery of the licenses as the JDC deliverable was deemed to be de minimis. In addition, since the first $1.5 million milestone payment is related to a submission of the CTA that is in the control of the parties', we recorded such milestone as variable consideration allocated to the licenses at the inception of the arrangement as we believe it is probable to be met and received. The future regulatory and commercial milestone payments will be recorded during the period the milestone is probable of achievement.\nRevenues\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\u2022 our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nThe FDA has designated CONTEPO as a QIDP and granted Fast Track designations to CONTEPO under the GAIN Act for:\nOur revenue consists principally of the collaboration revenues recorded from the Sinovant License Agreement, and includes a $5.0 million non-refundable upfront payment received as consideration for entering into the Sinovant License Agreement, as well as $1.5 million of variable consideration related to a milestone payment that we believe was probable to be met and was received in February of 2019. Revenue also includes governmental research premiums, non-refundable government grants and the benefit of government loans at below-market interest rates, which are more fully described below under \"Critical Accounting Policies.\"\nAlthough we have no current plans to finance development of CONTEPO for indications other than cUTI, including AP, these designations make CONTEPO eligible for Fast Track and Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, incentives. We may in the future consider additional non-dilutive financing options to advance these programs in the clinic.\nSinovant will be solely responsible for all costs related to developing, obtaining regulatory approval of and commercializing Licensed Products in the Territory and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize Licensed Product in the Territory. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply, pursuant to supply agreements to be negotiated by the parties, to Sinovant sufficient supply of lefamulin for Sinovant to\n\u2022 Reduce antibiotic therapy to the shortest effective duration.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will increase as we continue to invest in critical pre-commercialization activities prior to obtaining marketing approval for lefamulin and CONTEPO. If we obtain marketing approval for lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, in-license or acquire, we expect to incur significant additional commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. In addition, our expenses will increase if we suffer any regulatory delays or are required to conduct additional clinical trials to satisfy regulatory requirements.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2017\nWe believe that the ZEUS Study results, along with extensive clinical experience with IV fosfomycin for over 45 years outside the United States, support CONTEPO as a potential first-line treatment for cUTI suspected to be caused by MDR pathogens in the United States. A number of studies report that at least 20% of cUTIs are caused by MDR bacteria and limited treatment options are available in the United States. In addition, non-clinical data have shown that CONTEPO acts in combination with certain other antibiotics to improve bacterial killing.\nUnless earlier terminated, the Sinovant License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last royalty term for the last Licensed Product in the Territory, which we expect will occur in 2033. Following the expiration of the last royalty term, the license granted to Sinovant will become non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free and irrevocable. The Sinovant License Agreement may be terminated in its entirety by Sinovant upon 180 days' prior written notice at any time. Either party may, subject to specified cure periods, terminate the Sinovant License Agreement in the event of the other party's uncured material breach. Either party may also terminate the Sinovant License Agreement under specified circumstances relating to the other party's insolvency. We have the right to terminate the Sinovant License Agreement immediately if Sinovant does not reach certain development milestones by certain specified dates (subject to specified cure periods). The Sinovant License Agreement contemplates that the we will enter into ancillary agreements with Sinovant, including clinical and commercial supply agreements and a pharmacovigilance agreement.\nOperating Activities\n\u2022 the costs of developing lefamulin and CONTEPO for the treatment of additional indications;\nAt our Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held in October 2018, our shareholders approved the issuance of ordinary shares in settlement of potential milestone payment obligations that may become payable in the future to former Zavante stockholders, including the Approval Milestone Payment which will be settled in our ordinary shares. We also now have the right to settle the Net Sales Milestone Payments in our ordinary shares, except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement.\nConducting clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other products that we successfully develop, in-license or acquire, none of which are yet commercially available. In addition, if approved, lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, in-license or acquire may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nFinancing Activities\nAcquisition of Zavante\n\u2022 vendors in connection with preclinical development activities;\n\u2022 in-license or acquire other products, product candidates or technologies;\nWe expensed the acquired intellectual property as of the acquisition date as in-process research and development with no alternative future uses. We recorded an in-process research and development expense of $32.0 million which represents $26.9 million for the fair value of the Upfront Shares, $4.9 million of transaction costs and $0.2 million of net liabilities assumed.\nCONTEPO (fosfomycin for injection) is a novel, potentially first-in-class investigational intravenous antibiotic in the United States with a broad spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram-positive activity, including activity against most contemporary MDR strains such as ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. CONTEPO inhibits the bacteria's ability to form a normal cell wall, which is critical for the cell's survival and growth. It works at an earlier and different stage of cell wall synthesis than other injectable antibiotics, differentiating its mechanism of action from approved injectable antibiotics. CONTEPO utilizes a dosing approach developed by Zavante for the United States that is designed to optimize its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in order to improve treatment outcomes.\nIn March 2018, we entered into a license agreement, or the Sinovant License Agreement, with Sinovant Sciences, Ltd. or Sinovant, an affiliate of Roivant Sciences, Ltd., to develop and commercialize lefamulin in the greater China region. As part of the Sinovant License Agreement, Nabriva Therapeutics Ireland DAC and Nabriva Therapeutics GmbH, our wholly owned subsidiaries, granted Sinovant an exclusive license to develop and commercialize, and a non-exclusive license to manufacture, certain products containing lefamulin, or the Licensed Products, in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, which we refer to as the Territory. We retain development and commercialization rights in the rest of the world.\n\nOur income tax expense was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The year over year change was primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in our foreign subsidiaries. Our income tax (expense) benefit includes Irish, Austrian and U.S. income taxes at statutory rates and the effects of various permanent differences.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could result in a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we have completed or currently contemplate will be required for the completion of clinical development of any product candidate, we could be required to expend significant additional resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.\n\u2022 the costs of operating as a public company in the United States.\n\u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of lefamulin and CONTEPO;\nor revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required by for non-emerging growth companies.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2018\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income was relatively flat compared to the same period in 2016.\ngenerally well-tolerated safety profile. We believe lefamulin represents a potentially important new treatment option for the five to six million adults in the United States diagnosed with CABP each year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation not related to research and development activities for personnel in our finance, information technology, commercial, medical affairs and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include costs related to professional fees for auditors, lawyers and tax advisors and consulting fees not related to research and development operations, as well as functions that are partly or fully outsourced by us, such as accounting, payroll processing and information technology.\n\n\u2022 the need to satisfy interest and principal obligations in our debt facility;\noperations, costs associated with obtaining and maintaining intellectual property associated with our research and development operations, laboratory consumables, consulting fees related to research and development activities and other overhead costs. We utilize our research and development staff and infrastructure resources across multiple programs, and many of our indirect costs historically have not been specifically attributable to a single program. Accordingly, we cannot state precisely our total indirect costs incurred on a program-by-program basis.\n\u2022 the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials;\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022 the continued availability of Austrian governmental grants;\nAs a result of increasing resistance to antibiotics and the wide array of potential pathogens that cause CABP, the current standard of care for hospitalized patients with CABP whose treatment is initiated in the hospital usually involves first-line empiric treatment with a combination of antibiotics (beta-lactams and macrolides) to address all likely bacterial pathogens or monotherapy with a fluoroquinolone. Combination therapy presents the logistical challenge of administering multiple drugs with different dosing regimens, with some drugs available only as IV, and increases the risk of drug-drug interactions and the potential for serious side effects. Fluoroquinolones are associated with safety and tolerability concerns, including a relatively high risk for developing Clostridium difficile infection and increasing rates of resistance for uropathogens. We believe these concerns have resulted in a decreasing use of fluoroquinolones and restriction of their use within a growing number of hospitals. In addition, in May 2016, the FDA announced that an FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones, when used systemically, in the form of tablets, capsules and injectable, are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects that can occur together. These side effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system. Fluoroquinolones are typically administered in combination with other antibiotics, if community-acquired MRSA is suspected. In addition, many currently available antibiotic therapies are only available for IV administration and are prescribed for seven to fourteen days, meaning continued treatment requires prolonged hospitalization or a switch to a different antibiotic administered orally, with the attendant risk that the patient might respond differently.\nThe CONTEPO development program has focused on obtaining marketing approval in the United States for the treatment of cUTIs, including AP. In April 2017, Zavante announced the results of the pivotal ZEUS Study, in which CONTEPO met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority versus PIP-TAZ. Zavante then met with the FDA in the second half of 2017 to discuss the filing of an NDA for CONTEPO. We submitted an NDA for marketing approval of CONTEPO for the treatment of cUTI in adults in the United States, to the FDA in October 2018. The FDA has granted us PDUFA target action date of April 30, 2019 for CONTEPO.\nIncome tax (Expense) Benefit\nResearch and development expenses increased by $1.6 million from $48.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

IV fosfomycin has been approved for a number of indications and utilized for over 45 years in Europe to treat a variety of serious bacterial infections, including cUTIs. CONTEPO utilizes a new dosing regimen that optimize its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We believe these attributes, the extensive clinical experience worldwide and the positive efficacy and safety results from the Phase 2/3 clinical trial support CONTEPO as a first-line treatment for cUTIs, including acute pyelonephritis, or AP, suspected to be caused by MDR pathogens. At least 20% of cUTIs are caused by MDR bacteria and limited treatment options are available in the U.S. In addition, non-clinical data have shown that CONTEPO acts in combination with certain other antibiotics to improve bacterial killing.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCash Flows\nIn recognition of the growing need for the development of new antibiotics, recent regulatory changes, including Priority Review and regulatory guidance enabling smaller clinical trials, have led to renewed interest from the pharmaceutical industry in anti-infective development. For example, the FDA Safety and Innovation Act became law in 2012 and included the GAIN Act, which provides incentives, including access to expedited FDA review for approval, Fast Track designation and five years of potential data exclusivity extension for the development of new QIDPs.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on our limited historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that pleuromutilin antibiotics can help address the major public health threat posed by bacterial resistance, which the World Health Organization, or WHO, characterized in 2017 as one of the biggest threats to human health. Increasing resistance to antibiotics used to treat CABP is a growing concern and has become an issue in selecting the appropriate initial antibiotic treatment prior to determining the specific microbiological cause of the infection, referred to as empiric treatment. For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, has classified Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common respiratory pathogen, as a serious threat to human health as a result of\nRevenues increased by $4.3 million from $5.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the $5.0 million upfront payment received from our Sinovant License Agreement, as well as a $1.5 million of variable consideration related to a future milestone payment pursuant to the Sinovant License Agreement that we believe is probable to be met. Grant revenue from research premiums provided to us by the Austrian government decreased by $2.2 million as a result of a decrease in our research and development expenses for which we can receive grant revenue.\nIn addition, our expenses will increase if and as we:\nOn March 1, 2017, Nabriva Therapeutics plc, or Nabriva Ireland, was incorporated in Ireland under the name Hyacintho 2 plc, and was renamed to Nabriva Therapeutics plc on April 10, 2017, in order to effectuate the change of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the ultimate company of the group from Austria to Ireland. Nabriva Ireland replaced Nabriva Therapeutics AG, or Nabriva Austria, as the ultimate parent company on June 23, 2017, following the conclusion of a tender offer, or the Exchange Offer, in which holders of 98.6% of the outstanding share capital of Nabriva Austria exchanged their holdings for ordinary shares, $0.01 nominal value per share, of Nabriva Ireland, which\nincreasing resistance to currently available antibiotics. In addition, the CDC recently reported on the growing evidence of widespread resistance to macrolides, widely used antibiotics that disrupt bacterial protein synthesis, in Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common cause of CABP that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or MRSA, which has also been designated as a serious threat to human health by the CDC, has emerged as a more common cause of CABP in some regions of the world, and a possible pathogen to be covered with empiric therapy.\nIn March 2018, we entered into a sales agreement, or the ATM Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, pursuant to which, from time to time, we may offer and sell our ordinary shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through Cantor pursuant to an effective universal shelf registration statement. Sales of our ordinary shares, if any, under the agreement with Cantor may be made in sales deemed to be an \"at-the-market offering\" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nCash flow provided by financing activities increased by $49.9 million from $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the gross proceeds of $80.0 million from our 2017 equity financing, compared to the proceeds of $24.8 million from our rights offering and related underwritten offering in December 2016. The year-over-year increase in financing cash inflows was partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in equity transaction costs.\n\u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022 the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up activities associated with lefamulin and CONTEPO;\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $394.0 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through our 2018 equity offering, our term loan, our \"at-the-market\" offering facility, our 2017 equity offering, our 2016 rights offering, our 2015 initial public offering, private placements of our equity securities, convertible loans and research and development support from governmental grants and loans. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials. Our ability to generate profits from operations and remain profitable depends on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize drugs that generate significant revenue.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2018\n\u2022 seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\nWe may take advantage of these provisions until December 31, 2020 or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earlier to occur of: the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1 billion in annual revenues (as may be inflation adjusted by the SEC from time-to-time); the date we qualify as a \"large accelerated filer,\" with at least more than $700 million in market value of our share capital held by nonaffiliates; or the issuance by us of more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.

Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock.\n\u2022 expand our physical presence in the United States and Ireland; and,\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by $32.7 million from $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $82.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $32.0 million increase for in-process research and development expenses associated with the acquisition of Zavante assets, a $6.5 million increase in research consulting fees, a $6.5 million increase associated with the payment of the NDA fees to the FDA for lefamulin and CONTEPO, a $1.9 million increase in staff costs due to the addition of employees, a $0.3 million increase in travel and other research and development costs, partly offset by a $13.9 million decrease in research materials and purchased services related to the development of lefamulin and a $0.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this filing. However, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nCash flow utilized by operating activities increased by $21.0 million from $48.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to a $16.1 million increase in net loss, after adjustments for non-cash amounts included in net loss and higher working capital of $4.9 million primarily due to changes in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nIn December 2018, we announced the closing of up to a $75.0 million term loan with Hercules, or the Loan Agreement, $25.0 million of which was funded on the day of closing. Under the terms of the loan, in addition to the $25.0 million received at closing, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $15.0 million in two tranches upon the approval by the FDA of the NDAs recently submitted for lefamulin and CONTEPO. We will also be eligible to receive an additional $30.0 million of aggregate term loan advances in three separate tranches upon the achievement of specified product revenue milestones. These additional tranches are at our discretion and may only be drawn upon during specified periods of time. The final $5.0 million tranche is available through December 31, 2021, subject to the lenders' sole discretion. We are entitled to make interest-only payments through July 1,\nIn December 2016, we completed a rights offering and a related underwritten offering for the sale of an aggregate of 588,127 common shares resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $24.8 million and net proceeds to us of $20.6 million, after deducting underwriting fees and offering expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses represented 22.0%, 37.3% and 33.7% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel anti-infective agents to treat serious infections. We have two product candidates that have been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for approval: lefamulin, potentially the first pleuromutilin antibiotic available for oral and intravenous (or IV) administration in humans, for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP and CONTEPO, a potentially first-in-class epoxide antibiotic for intravenous (or IV) use in the United States for complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTI. We may potentially develop lefamulin and CONTEPO for additional indications. Both lefamulin formulations and CONTEPO were granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, and Fast Track designation by the FDA, enabling Priority Review of the New Drug Applications, or the NDAs by the FDA.\n\u2022 the costs and timing of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing, for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval; and\nwe refer to as the Redomiciliation Transaction. The ordinary shares of Nabriva Ireland were issued on a one-for-ten basis to the holders of the Nabriva Austria common shares and on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the Nabriva Austria American Depositary Shares, or Nabriva Austria ADSs, participating in the Exchange Offer. On June 26, 2017, the ordinary shares of Nabriva Ireland began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \"NBRV,\" the same symbol under which the Nabriva Austria ADSs were previously traded. This transaction was accounted for as a merger between entities under common control; accordingly, the historical financial statements of Nabriva Austria for periods prior to this transaction are considered to be the historical financial statements of Nabriva Ireland. As of August 18, 2017, 100% of Nabriva Austria share capital had been exchanged for ordinary shares of Nabriva Ireland.\nResearch Premium and Grant Revenue\n\u2022 the rate of the expansion of our physical presence in the United States and Ireland; and\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, former Zavante stockholders and other equity holders, in the aggregate and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, will also be entitled to receive from us up to $97.5 million in contingent consideration, of which $25.0 million would become payable upon the first approval of an NDA from the the FDA for fosfomycin for injection for any indication, or the Approval Milestone Payment, and an aggregate of up to $72.5 million would become payable upon the achievement of specified sales milestones, or the Net Sales Milestone Payments.\n\u2022 exemptions from the requirements to obtain a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or a shareholder approval of any golden parachute arrangements.\nRevenues\n\u2022 acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, or ABSSSI\nUnder the Sinovant License Agreement, Sinovant and our subsidiaries have established a joint development committee, or the JDC, to review and oversee development and commercialization plans in the Territory. We received a $5.0 million upfront payment pursuant to the terms of the Sinovant License Agreement and will be eligible for up to an additional $91.5 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestone events related to lefamulin for CABP, plus an additional $4.0 million in milestone payments if any Licensed Product receives a second or any subsequent regulatory approval in the People's Republic of China. The first milestone was a $1.5 million payment for the submission of a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, by Sinovant to the Chinese Food and Drug Administration that was received in February 2019. The remaining milestone payments are tied to additional regulatory approvals and annual sales targets. In addition, we will be eligible to receive low double-digit royalties on sales, if any, of Licensed Products in the Territory.\nOn July 24, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Zavante Therapeutics, Inc., or Zavante, a privately-held late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies to improve the outcomes of hospitalized patients. Zavante's lead product candidate is CONTEPOTM (fosfomycin for injection, previously referred to as ZTI-01 and ZOLYD).\nOverview\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017:\nAs a company that carries out research and development activities, we benefit from the Austrian research and development support regime, under which we are eligible to receive a research premium from the Austrian government equal to 12% of a specified research and development cost base. Qualifying expenditures largely comprise research and development activities conducted in Austria, however, the research premium is also available for certain related third-party expenses with additional limitations. We recorded research premiums of $6.2 million, $4.8 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. We have not received any research premium for our qualified 2018 expenditures as of December 31, 2018. We recognize the research premium, as long as we have incurred research and development expenses. Significant judgment is required in determining which expenditures are eligible to be included in the research and development costs base and such costs are subject to review by the Austrian government.\nIn September 2017 we completed an underwritten public offering of 9,411,765 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $8.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $80.0 million and net proceeds to us of $73.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nIn connection with the closing of the Acquisition, we have assumed other agreements entered into by Zavante, including, among others, an R&D office lease, a collaboration agreement governing the supply and manufacturing agreements described above and a commercial packaging agreement.\nCash flow provided by investing activities increased by $26.4 million from $23.4 million cash inflow in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $49.7 million cash inflow in the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase of $15.0 million in proceeds from sale of available-for-sale securities to fund operational cash out flows and a decrease of $57.0 million in purchases of available-for\n\u2022 subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue received from commercial sales of lefamulin and CONTEPO;\nInterest expense, net\nexpenses are defined as costs incurred for the application of research findings or specialist knowledge to production, production methods, services or goods prior to the commencement of commercial production or use.

The increase was primarily due to a $2.6 million increase of advisory and external consultancy expenses primarily related to pre-commercialization activities and professional service fees, a $9.6 million increase in staff costs\n\u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022 initiate or continue the research and development of lefamulin and CONTEPO for additional indications and of our other product candidates;\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, and funding from local and international government entities and non-government organizations in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nprimarily due to a $2.1 million increase in staff costs due to the addition of employees and a $1.2 million increase in share-based compensation expense also due to the inclusion of additional employees in our share-based compensation plan, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in direct costs for purchased services related to the development of lefamulin and a $0.2 million decrease of advisory and external consultancy, travel and other expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nLefamulin is a semi-synthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic discovered and developed by our team with the potential to be first-in-class for IV and oral in humans. It inhibits the synthesis of bacterial protein, which is required for bacteria to grow by binding with high affinity, high specificity and at molecular targets that are different than other antibiotic classes. Based on results from two global, Phase 3 clinical trials, we believe that lefamulin is well-positioned for use as a first-line monotherapy for the treatment of CABP due to its novel mechanism of action, targeted spectrum of activity, resistance profile, achievement of substantial drug concentration in lung tissue and fluid, availability of oral and IV formulations and a\nIncome Tax Expense\nthings, that we do not obtain any additional funding through grants and clinical trial support, collaboration agreements, equity or debt financings, including additional advances under the Loan Agreement with Hercules. We may be eligible to borrow up an additional $50.0 million under our Loan Agreement with Hercules if we achieve specified regulatory and product revenue milestones, including $10.0 million that we will be eligible to borrow upon the approval by the FDA of an NDA for lefamulin and $5.0 million that we will be eligible to borrow upon the approval by the FDA of an NDA for CONTEPO.\nCash flow provided by investing activities decreased by $54.4 million from $49.7 million of cash provided for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $4.6 million cash used for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a $51.0 million decrease in proceeds from sale of available-for-sale financial assets to fund operational cash outflows and $4.3 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of Zavante assets.\nobtain marketing approval for CONTEPO before April 2019 or for lefamulin before August 2019, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization effort.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from product sales. Based on our current plans, we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, lefamulin and CONTEPO. We do not expect to obtain marketing approval for CONTEPO before April 2019 or for lefamulin before August 2019, if at all. If our development efforts result in clinical success and regulatory approval, we may also enter into collaboration agreements with third parties and we may generate revenue from those agreements.\n\nInvesting Activities\nmanufacture finished drug products for development and commercialization of the Licensed Products in the Territory.\nsale-securities in 2017. The year over year increase in investing activities was partially offset by a $45.0 million decrease in proceeds from maturities of term deposits.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net interest expense increased over the prior year due to lower interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following table summarizes our direct research and development expenses by program and our indirect costs.\nIn July 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 18,181,818 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $2.75 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $50.0 million and net proceeds to us of $46.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\n2020, with incremental extensions through January 1, 2022 upon the achievement of specified performance milestones. We are required to repay the term loan after the interest only period based on a monthly amortization schedule, with a final maturity date occurring on June 1, 2023. The term loan bears interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of 9.80% and 9.80% plus the prime rate of interest minus 5.50%. The Loan Agreement provides for interest-only payments through July 1, 2020, which may be incrementally extended from time to time upon the occurrence of certain conditions through January 1, 2022, and repayment of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loan thereafter in monthly installments through June 1, 2023. In addition, we are required to pay a fee of 6.95% of the aggregate amount of advances under the Loan Agreement at maturity. At our option, we may elect to prepay any portion of the outstanding term loan that is greater than or equal to $5.0 million by paying such portion of the principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus a prepayment charge equal to the following percentage of the principal amount being prepaid: (i) 3.0% if the term loan is prepaid during the first 12 months following the initial closing, (ii) 2.0% if the term loan is prepaid after 12 months following the initial closing but before 24 months following the initial closing and (iii) 1.0% if the term loan is prepaid any time thereafter but prior to the final maturity date. We are also required to satisfy certain financial covenants, including an obligation to maintain specified minimum amounts of cash and cash equivalents in accounts pledged to Hercules.\nNabriva Austria was incorporated in October 2005 in Austria under the name Nabriva Therapeutics Forschungs GmbH, a limited liability company organized under Austrian law, as a spin-off from Sandoz GmbH and commenced operations in February 2006. In 2007, Nabriva Austria transformed into a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) under the name Nabriva Therapeutics AG. On October 19, 2017, Nabriva Austria was converted into a limited liability company under Austrian law and renamed Nabriva Therapeutics GmbH. In 2014, we established our wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, which began operations in August 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $16.0 million from $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $4.1 million increase in legal fees mainly related to the redomiciliation of our parent company from Austria to Ireland, a $6.1 million increase of advisory and external consultancy expenses primarily related to pre-commercialization activities and professional service fees, a $2.0 million increase in share-based compensation expense due to the inclusion of additional employees in our share-based compensation plan, a $2.8 million increase in staff costs due to the addition of employees, a $0.7 million increase in VAT tax expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in support, infrastructure and other corporate costs.\nOther income (expense), net\n\u2022 seek marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical development;\nResults of Operations\n\u2022 Reduce the risk of antibiotics associated with a high risk of C. difficile infections;\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nIn addition, we assumed certain liabilities and obligations, including contractual liabilities and obligations, that were assumed by us upon the Closing. Prior to the Acquisition, Zavante was obligated to make milestone payments to the former stockholders of $3.0 million upon marketing approval by the FDA with respect to any oral, intravenous or other form of fosfomycin, or the Zavante Products, and milestone payments of up to $26.0 million in the aggregate upon the occurrence of various specified levels of net sales with respect to the Zavante Products. In addition, Zavante is obligated to make annual royalty payments of a mid-single-digit percentage of net sales of Zavante Products, subject to adjustment based on net sales thresholds and with such percentage reduced to low single-digits if generic fosfomycin products account for half of the applicable market on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Zavante will also pay a mid-single-digit percentage of transaction revenue in connection with the consummation of the grant, sale, license or transfer of market exclusivity rights for a qualified infectious disease product (within the meaning of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act) related to a Zavante Product.\n\u2022 an exemption from compliance with any requirement that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\nIn December 2018, we announced the closing of up to a $75.0 million term loan with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, $25.0 million of which was funded on the day of closing. Under the terms of the loan, in addition to the $25.0 million received at closing, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $15.0 million in two tranches upon the approval by the FDA of the NDAs recently submitted for lefamulin and CONTEPO. We will also be eligible to receive an additional $30.0 million of aggregate term loan advances in three separate tranches upon the achievement of specified product revenue milestones. These additional tranches are at our discretion and may only be drawn upon during specified periods of time. The final $5.0 million tranche is available through December 31, 2021, subject to Hercules' sole discretion. We are entitled to make interest-only payments through July 1, 2020, with incremental extensions through January 1, 2022 upon the achievement of specified performance milestones. We are required to repay the term loan after the interest only period based on a monthly amortization schedule, with a final maturity date occurring on June 1, 2023.\n\u2022 CROs in connection with clinical trials; and,\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of delayed adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will adopt new\nWe accounted for the Acquisition as an asset acquisition as the arrangement did not meet the definition of a business pursuant to the guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 805, Business Combinations. We concluded the Acquisition did not meet the definition of a business because the transaction principally resulted in the acquisition of the exclusive rights to IV fosfomycin in the U.S. which is a single identifiable asset and represents substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\u2022 investigative sites in connection with clinical trials.\nOperating Activities\n\u2022 ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, or VABP\nOur income tax expense was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $49,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Zavante had also entered into a manufacturing and exclusive supply agreement with Laboratorios ERN, S.A., pursuant to which Laboratorios ERN, S.A. has agreed to supply Zavante with certain technical documentation and data as required for submission of an NDA or an abbreviated new drug application for CONTEPO and certain regulatory support in connection with the commercial sale and use of CONTEPO in the United States, and which provides for payments by Zavante to Laboratorios ERN, S.A. of a one-time cash payment upon the first commercial sale of CONTEPO and subsequent quarterly payments thereafter based on the number of vials of CONTEPO sold in the United States during each quarter.\nSubject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, 10% of the Upfront Shares, or the Holdback Shares, will serve as a source for the satisfaction of indemnification and other obligations of the former Zavante stockholders and, subject to reduction in respect of these obligations, will be issued to the former Zavante stockholders following the first anniversary of the Closing.\nFinancing Activities\n\u2022 complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTI\n\u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of product development of any other product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022 reduced disclosure about the company's executive compensation arrangements; and\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe submitted an NDA, for marketing approval of CONTEPO for the treatment of cUTI in adults in the United States, to the FDA in October 2018. The NDA submission is utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and is supported by a robust data package, including a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial (known as ZEUSTM), which met its primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority to piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with cUTI, including AP. We submitted two NDAs to the FDA for the oral and IV formulations of lefamulin for the treatment of CABP in December 2018. The FDA has granted us a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date of April 30, 2019 for CONTEPO and a PDUFA target action date of August 19, 2019 for lefamulin. We plan to submit a marketing authorization application for lefamulin in Europe in the first half of 2019. The two NDAs are supported by two pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trials (known as LEAP 1 and LEAP 2) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of IV and oral lefamulin compared to moxifloxacin in the treatment of adults with CABP, including the option to switch from IV to oral administration and a short course oral treatment with lefamulin. In both LEAP 1 and LEAP 2, lefamulin was demonstrated to be non-inferior to moxifloxacin, and met both the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for the treatment of CABP. Lefamulin was also shown to be generally well-tolerated when administered either orally or intravenously.\nOur expenses will increase if we suffer any regulatory delays or are required to conduct additional clinical trials to satisfy regulatory requirements. If we obtain marketing approval for lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, in-license or acquire, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing.\nInvesting Activities\nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2018, proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares under the our ATM Agreement of $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2019, as well as a $1.5 million milestone payment received in February 2019 under our license agreement with Sinovant Sciences, Ltd., and research premiums from the Austrian government for our qualified research and development expenditures, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2020. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. This estimate assumes, among other\nBased on our current plans, we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, lefamulin and CONTEPO.

The increase was primarily due to re-measurements of our foreign currency account balances.\nRevenues, consisting primarily of research premium and grant revenue, decreased by $1.2 million from $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change was primarily due to a $1.4 million decrease in grant revenue from research premiums provided to us by the Austrian government as a result of lower applicable research and development

lefamulin could be well suited as either a first-line or second-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of CABP patients in the hospital setting, outpatient-transition of care or in the community setting, because of its novel mechanism of action, complete spectrum of activity for CABP pathogens, including against multidrug resistant strains, achievement of substantial drug concentrations in

the MD&A report:\n\n- Revenues increased from $5.3 million in 2017 to $9.7 million in 2018, primarily due to a $5 million upfront payment from the Sinovant license agreement and a $1.5 million milestone payment. \n\n- Research and development expenses increased from $49.6 million in 2017 to $82.3 million in 2018, mainly driven by $32 million for in-process research and development from the Zavante acquisition.\n\n- General and administrative expenses increased from $29.5 million in 2017 to $41.7 million in 2018, primarily due to increased staff costs and advisory/consulting expenses related to pre-commercialization activities.\n\n- Net loss increased from $74.4 million in 2017 to $114.8 million in 2018, reflecting the increased operating expenses. \n\n- Cash flow from operations was -$72.7 million in 2018 compared to -$69.3 million in 2017. Cash from financing activities was $92.9 million in 2018 versus $72.2 million in 2017, reflecting proceeds from equity offerings and debt financing.\n\n- As of December 31, 2018, the company had $102.6 million in cash and expects this can fund operations into Q2 2020. Key upcoming milestones are FDA approval decisions on CONTEPO and lefamulin.\n\nIn summary, the increase in net loss was driven by R&D and G&A spending, offset by some new licensing revenue, and the company raised additional capital to support ongoing operations and upcoming regulatory decisions."}
