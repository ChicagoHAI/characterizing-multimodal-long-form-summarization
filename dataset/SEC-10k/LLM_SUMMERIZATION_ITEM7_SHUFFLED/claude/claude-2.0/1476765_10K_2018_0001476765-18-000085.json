This annual report on Form 10-K contains statistics and other data that have been obtained from or compiled from information made available by third-party service providers. We have not independently verified such statistics or data.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a business development\ncompany and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code.\nOur shares are currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol GBDC\u201d.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle-market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies. We may also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in U.S. middle-market companies. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to U.S. middle-market companies with over $25.0 billion in capital under management as of September 30, 2018, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital.\nOur investment activities are managed by GC Advisors and supervised by our board of directors of which a majority of the members are independent of us, GC Advisors and its affiliates.\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, which was most recently reapproved by our board of directors in May 2018, we have agreed to pay GC Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by an administrator, or the Administrator, which is currently Golub Capital LLC. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\nWe seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by primarily investing approximately $5.0 million to $30.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of U.S. middle-market companies. We may also selectively invest more than $30.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.\nWe generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which may be referred to as junk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following:\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of September 30, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investments at\nFair Value\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investments at\nFair Value\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>195,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,430,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,334,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LLC equity interests in SLF(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,782,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,685,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Represents an amount less than 0.1%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Proceeds from the LLC equity interests invested in SLF were utilized by SLF to invest in senior secured loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> One stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as late stage lending loans. Other targeted characteristics of late stage lending businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower's high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we may adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, one stop loans included $169.4 million and $138.6 million, respectively, of late stage lending loans at fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had debt and equity investments in 199, 185 and 183 portfolio companies, respectively, and an investment in SLF.\nThe following table shows the weighted average income yield and weighted average investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented nearly 100% of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value, and the total return based on the change in the quoted market price of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, in each case for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average income yield(1)(2)\n</td> <td>8.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average investment income yield(1)(3)\n</td> <td>8.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return based on average net asset value(4)\n</td> <td>8.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return based on market value(5)\n</td> <td>7.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average income yield and weighted average investment income yield do not reflect interest income from subordinated notes in SLF, which were redeemed on December 30, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents income from interest, including subordinated notes in SLF, and fees, excluding amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Represents income from interest, including subordinated notes in SLF, fees and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>Total return based on average net asset value is calculated as (a) the net increase in net assets resulting from operations divided by (b) the daily average of total net assets.

Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, second lien or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are\ncapitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see Critical Accounting Policies-Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment or derivative instrument, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and derivative instruments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nExpenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees and expenses incurred by GC Advisors payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments, which fees and expenses may include, among other items, due diligence reports, appraisal reports, any studies that may be commissioned by GC Advisors and travel and lodging expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>offerings of our common stock and other securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, including costs associated with meeting financial sponsors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>U.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>all costs of registration and listing our shares on any securities exchange;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>U.S. federal, state and local taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>independent directors' fees and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs associated with individual or group stockholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>proxy voting expenses;

Under the 2010 Collateral Management Agreement, the term \u2018\u2018collection period'' referred to a quarterly period running from the day after the end of the prior collection period to the fifth business day of the calendar month in which a payment date occurs. Following the redemption of the 2010 Notes on July 20, 2018, the 2010 Collateral Management Agreement was terminated.\nGC Advisors, as collateral manager for the 2014 Issuer, our wholly-owned subsidiary, under a collateral management agreement, or the 2014 Collateral Management Agreement, is entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.25% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2014 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2014 Collateral Management Agreement, the term \u2018\u2018collection period'' refers to a quarterly period running from the day after the end of the prior collection period to the tenth business day prior to the payment date.\nCollateral management fees were paid directly by the 2010 Issuer and are paid by the 2014 Issuer to GC Advisors and are offset against the management fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In addition, the 2010 Issuer and 2014 Issuer paid Wells Fargo Securities, LLC structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the initial structuring and subsequent amendments to the 2010 Debt Securitization and the initial structuring of the 2014 Debt Securitization. Term debt securitizations are also known as collateralized loan obligations and are a form of secured financing incurred by us, which is consolidated by us and subject to our overall asset coverage requirement. The 2010 Issuer, the 2014 Issuer and 2018 Issuer also agreed to pay ongoing administrative expenses to the trustee, collateral manager, independent accountants, legal counsel, rating agencies and independent managers in connection with developing and maintaining reports, and providing required services in connection with the administration of the 2010 Debt Securitization, the 2014 Debt Securitization, and 2018 Debt Securitization, and collectively the Debt Securitizations, as applicable.\nWe believe that these administrative expenses approximate the amount of ongoing fees and expenses that we would be required to pay in connection with a traditional secured credit facility. Our common stockholders indirectly bear all of these expenses.\nRecent Developments\nOn November 1, 2018, the 2018 Issuer entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Golub Capital BDC CLO III Depositor LLC, as depositor, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as the initial purchaser, or the Initial Purchaser, pursuant to which the 2018 Issuer agreed to sell the 2018 Notes to the Initial Purchaser as part of the 2018 Debt Securitization. Term debt securitizations are also known as CLOs and are a form of secured financing incurred by the Company, which are consolidated by the Company and subject to its overall asset coverage requirement.\nOn November 1, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the documents governing the MS Credit Facility. The MS Credit Facility amendment increased the borrowing capacity under the MS Credit Facility from $300.0 million to $450.0 million. The other material terms of the MS Credit Facility were unchanged.\nOn November 16, 2018, we completed the 2018 Debt Securitization. The 2018 Notes were issued by the 2018 Issuer and are backed by a diversified portfolio of senior secured and second lien loans. The transaction was executed through a private placement of approximately $327.0 million of AAA/AAA Class A 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 1.48%; $61.2 million of AA Class B 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.10%; $20.0 million of A Class C-1 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.80%; $38.8 million of A Class C-2 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.65%; $42.0 million of BBB- Class D 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.95%; and $113.4 million of Subordinated 2018 Notes which do not bear interest. We indirectly retained all of the Class C-2, Class D and Subordinated 2018 Notes. The 2018 Notes are scheduled to mature on January 20, 2031.\nA portion of the proceeds of the private placement of the 2018 Notes, net of expenses, was used to repay all amounts outstanding under the MS Credit Facility, following which the agreements governing the MS Credit Facility were terminated.\nWe entered into two loan sale agreements which govern the 2018 Debt Securitization. Under the terms of the loan sale agreement entered into upon the Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement, which provides for the sale of assets on the Closing Date to satisfy risk retention requirements, (1) we transferred to GC Advisors a portion of our ownership interest in the portfolio company investments securing the 2018 Debt Securitization for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement and (2) immediately thereafter, GC\nAdvisors sold to the 2018 Issuer all of its ownership interest in such portfolio loans for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement. Under the terms of the other loan sale agreement governing the 2018 Debt Securitization Depositor Loan Sale Agreement, which provides for the sale of assets on the Closing Date as well as future sales from us to the 2018 Issuer through CLO Depositor, (3) we sold and/or contributed to the CLO Depositor the remainder of its ownership interest in the portfolio company investments securing the 2018 Debt Securitization and participations for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the Depositor Loan Sale Agreement and (4) CLO Depositor, in turn, sold to the 2018 Issuer all of its ownership interest in such portfolio loans and participations for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in one of the loan sale agreements. Following these transfers, the 2018 Issuer, and neither GC Advisors, the CLO Depositor nor us, held all of the ownership interest in such portfolio company investments and participations. We made customary representations, warranties and covenants in these loan sale agreements.\nThe 2018 Notes are the secured obligations of the 2018 Issuer, and an indenture governing the 2018 Notes includes customary covenants and events of default. The 2018 Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state blue sky\u201d laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission or an applicable exemption from registration.\nGC Advisors, will serve as collateral manager to the 2018 Issuer under a collateral management agreement and will receive a fee for providing these services in an amount equal to 0.25% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2018 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the total fees paid to GC Advisors for rendering collateral management services, which are less than the management fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, will be offset against such management fee.\nUnder the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, the term \u2018\u2018collection period'' refers to a quarterly period commencing on the third business day prior to the preceding collection period to the and ending on (but excluding) the third business day prior to the payment date. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the total fees paid to GC Advisors for rendering these collateral management services, which are less than the management fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, will be offset against such management fee. In addition, the 2018 Issuer paid Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the structuring of the 2018 Debt Securitization.\nOn November 27, 2018, our board of directors recommended that we seek shareholder approval to reduce our asset coverage requirement to 150.0% at our annual meeting of stockholders currently scheduled for February 5, 2019. To the extent stockholder approval is received, we currently intend to target a GAAP debt-to-equity ratio of about 1.0x.\nOn November 27, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to merge with GCIC with us as the surviving entity. Our board of directors and the board of directors of GCIC, including all of the respective independent directors, have approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein. Under the terms of the proposed merger, stockholders of GCIC will receive 0.865 shares of our stock for each share of GCIC, subject to adjustment only in the event of reclassification, recapitalization, or similar transaction by either company. The combined company will remain externally managed by GC Advisors and our officers and directors will remain in their current roles. The combined company will continue to trade under the ticker GBDC on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Consummation of the proposed merger is subject to our and GCIC stockholder approvals, customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Assuming satisfaction of these conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019.\nAs a result of the merger, we will be subject to certain additional risks, which will be set forth in the joint proxy statement/prospectus for the merger that we anticipate filing with the SEC in December 2018.\nIn connection with the closing of the merger, it is our board of directors' intention to increase the dividend per quarter to $0.33 per share; provided that our board of directors' reserves the right to revisit this intention if market conditions or our prospects meaningfully change.\nOn November 27, 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.32 per share and a special distribution of $0.12 per share both of which are payable on December 28, 2018 to holders of record as of December 12, 2018.\nMarket Trends\nWe have identified the following trends that may affect our business:\nTarget Market. We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Golub Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nSpecialized Lending Requirements. We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nDemand for Debt Capital. We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and subordinated debt from other sources, such as us.\nCompetition from Bank Lenders. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We believe these factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore more market opportunities for us.\nMarket Environment: We believe that as part of the path of economic recovery following the credit crisis, there has been increased competition for new middle-market investments due to some new non-bank finance companies that have entered the market and due to improving financial performance of middle-market companies. However, we believe that our scale and strong market position will continue to allow us to find investment opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nConsolidated operating results for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variances\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from accretion of discounts and origination fees\n</td> <td>9,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and dividend income from investments in SLF(1)\n</td> <td>8,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend income\n</td> <td>624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee income\n</td> <td>2,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>152,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>76,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income -

As a result, annual comparisons of net income may not be meaningful.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income increased from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018 by $14.4 million primarily as a result of an increase in the average earning debt investments balance, which is the average balance of accruing loans in our investment portfolio, of $47.6 million, an increase in LIBOR and an increase in income from our investments in SLF attributable to increase in income from our investments in SLF. Investment income increased from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017 by $9.9 million primarily as a result of an increase in the average earning investment balance, which is the annual average balance of accruing loans in our investment portfolio, of $137.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decline in income from our investments in SLF of $4.5 million that was attributable to a decline in the credit performance of SLF's portfolio.\nThe income yield by debt security type for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>7.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop\n</td> <td>8.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien\n</td> <td>10.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>15.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes in SLF(1)\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>SLF's proceeds from the subordinated notes were utilized by SLF to invest in senior secured loans.

The decrease in our debt was primarily driven by a decrease in the weighted average of outstanding borrowings on the Credit Facility from $138.8 million as of September 30, 2017 to $103.0 million as of September 30, 2018. The effective average interest rate on our outstanding debt\nincreased to 4.0% for the year ended September 30, 2018 from 3.6% for the year ended September 30, 2017 primarily due to the increase in LIBOR.\nInterest and other debt financing expenses increased by $4.7 million from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017 primarily due to the increase in the weighted average of outstanding borrowings from $826.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to $873.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 and an increase in the effective annual interest rate. The effective average interest rate on our outstanding debt increased to 3.6% for the year ended September 30, 2017 from 3.4% for the year ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the increase in LIBOR.\nAmortization of debt issuance costs remained relatively stable from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018 as new debt issuance costs associated with the new or amended debt facilities were offset by the full amortization of previous costs incurred. Amortization of debt issuance costs declined from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017 as initial debt issuance costs associated with $125.0 million of SBIC IV debentures fully amortized.\nManagement Fee\nThe base management fee increased as a result of a sequential increase in average adjusted gross assets from 2016 to 2018.\nIncentive Fees\nThe incentive fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement consists of two parts: (1) the Income Incentive Fee and (2) the Capital Gain Incentive Fee. The Income Incentive Fee increased by $6.9 million from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily as a result of the increase in net investment income. As the Company remains in the \"catch-up\" provision of the Income Incentive Fee calculation, the increase in net investment income causes a corresponding increase in the Income Incentive Fee until the Company is fully through the \"catch-up\" provision. The Income Incentive Fee decreased by $1.3 million from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017 as the interest rate compression on new investments and the decline of second lien and subordinated debt investments in our portfolio caused a decline in our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets. For the year ended September 30, 2018, while still not fully through the \"catch-up\" provision in any quarter of the Income Incentive Fee calculation, the Income Incentive Fee as a percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income increased to 18.7% compared to 6.1% for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 8.3% for the year ended September 30, 2016.\nThe Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement for each of the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $2.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.0 million, respectively. However, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, we are required to include the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The capital gain incentive fee accrual which was calculated in accordance with GAAP as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $7.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively. Any payment due under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement is calculated in arrears at the end of each calendar year, and we paid a $1.2 million Capital Gain Incentive Fee calculated in accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement as of December 31, 2017. The Company did not pay any Capital Gain Incentive Fee calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement as of any date prior to December 31, 2017.\nThe accrual for capital gain incentive fee under GAAP was $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2018, $2.8 million, or $0.05 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2017, and $1.2 million, or $0.03 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in accruals for a capital gain incentive fee under GAAP for the year ended September 30, 2018 from the year ended September 30, 2017 was primarily the result of unrealized depreciation of debt and equity investments. The increase in accruals for a capital gain incentive fee under GAAP for the year ended September 30, 2017 from the year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the\nresult of unrealized appreciation of debt and equity investments. For additional details on unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments, refer to the Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\u201d section below.\nProfessional Fees, Administrative Service Fee, and General and Administrative Expenses\nIn total, professional fees, the administrative service fee, and general and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018 and decreased by $0.2 million from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017. In general, we expect certain of our operating expenses, including professional fees, the administrative service fee, and other general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets during periods of growth and increase as a percentage of our total assets during periods of asset declines.\nThe Administrator pays for certain expenses incurred by us. These expenses are subsequently reimbursed in cash. Total expenses reimbursed by us to the Administrator for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $2.4 million, $2.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses were $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for accrued expenses paid on behalf of us by the Administrator.\nExcise Tax Expense\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, as well as timely distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid for each tax year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders that will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year in an amount less than what would trigger payments of U.S. federal income tax under Subchapter M of the Code. We may then be required to incur a 4% excise tax on such income. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income may exceed estimated current year distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred a net expense of $0, $17,000 and $333,000, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variances\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain (loss) on investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency transactions\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain (loss) on investments and foreign currency transactions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized appreciation on investments\n</td> <td>25,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,882\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,935\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (depreciation) on investments\n</td> <td>(34,832\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,640\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,411\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized appreciation on investments in SLF(1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,969\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (depreciation) on investments in SLF(1)\n</td> <td>(1,881\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,562\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,881\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized appreciation on secured borrowings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments, investments in SLF, secured borrowings and foreign currency\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,030\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,927\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in SLF includes our investment in subordinated notes and LLC equity interests in SLF.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For the year ended September 30, 2018, we had a net realized gain on investments and foreign currency transactions of $17.5 million primarily due to realized gains on the sale of equity securities in more than 20 portfolio company investments, partially offset by the realized loss on the sale or disposition of three under-performing debt investments.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we had $25.1 million in unrealized appreciation on 158 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $34.8 million in unrealized depreciation on 169 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2018 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the reversal of the net unrealized appreciation associated with the sales of portfolio company investments, the amortization of discounts, and negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we had $1.9 million in unrealized depreciation on our investment in SLF LLC equity interests, which was primarily driven by net negative credit related adjustments associated with SLF's investment portfolio.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017 we had a net realized gain on investments of $9.4 million primarily due to net realized gains on the sale of equity securities in 18 portfolio company investments and net gains on the sale of debt investments to SLF, which was partially offset by a net realized loss on the sale of a debt and equity investment in a single portfolio company.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we had $28.0 million in unrealized appreciation on 186 portfolio company investments, which was partially offset by $26.6 million in unrealized depreciation on 192 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2017 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments and the reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation associated with the non-accrual portfolio company investments that were sold and written-off. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the amortization of discounts, negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value and the reversal of the net unrealized appreciation associated with the sales of portfolio company investments.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we had $2.0 million in unrealized appreciation on our investment in SLF LLC equity interests. Unrealized appreciation on the SLF LLC equity interests was primarily driven by increased net investment income at SLF.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we had $32.9 million in unrealized appreciation on 143 portfolio company investments, which was partially offset by $31.4 million in unrealized depreciation on 142 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2016 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments and the reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation associated with the non-accrual portfolio company investments that were sold and written-off. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the amortization of discounts, negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value and the reversal of the net unrealized appreciation associated with the sales of portfolio company investments.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we had $6.3 million in net realized gains on investments, primarily due to the sale of, or capital gain distributions received from, several equity investments and the sale of debt investments to SLF that were partially offset by the realized loss on the sale of one non-accrual portfolio company investment and the write off of one non-accrual portfolio company investment.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we had $3.6 million in unrealized depreciation on our investments in SLF LLC equity interests. Unrealized depreciation on the SLF LLC equity interests was driven by negative credit related adjustments associated with SLF's investment portfolio that was primarily driven by one portfolio company investment taken to non-accrual status.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $16.9 million. During the period, cash used in operating activities was $8.6 million, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $646.6 million, partially offset by the proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $558.7 million and net investment income of $76.0 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $8.3 million, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $760.5 million that were partially offset by repayments of debt of $695.9 million and distributions paid of $71.1 million.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $27.0 million. During the period, cash provided by operating activities was $62.2 million, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $588.2 million, partially offset by the proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $588.2 million and net investment income of $69.5 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $89.2 million, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $545.0 million and net proceeds of an aggregate of $74.0 million from two equity offerings that were offset by repayments of debt of $628.6 million and distributions paid of $76.8 million.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $7.9 million. During the period, cash used in operating activities was $56.1 million, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $654.8 million, partially offset by the proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $538.6 million and net investment income of $65.0 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $48.1 million, primarily due to net proceeds of an aggregate $58.6 million from one equity offering and one private placement and net borrowings on debt of $51.5 million, partially offset by distributions paid of $59.5 million.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively. In addition, we had foreign currencies of $0.2 million as of September 30, 2018 and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $39.7 million and $58.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents are available to fund new investments, pay operating expenses and pay distributions. As of September 30, 2018, $14.7 million of our restricted cash and cash equivalents will be used for the payment of principal and interest expense on the notes issued in the 2014 Debt Securitization, which is described in further detail in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

As of September 30, 2018, $8.1 million of our restricted cash and cash equivalents could be used to fund investments that meet the guidelines under the MS Credit Facility as well as for the payment of interest expense and revolving debt of the MS Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2018, $11.1 million of our restricted cash and cash equivalents could be used to fund new\ninvestments that meet the regulatory and investment guidelines established by the SBA for our SBICs, which are described in further detail in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, and for interest expense and fees on our outstanding SBA debentures.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Credit Facility allowed Funding to borrow up to $170.0 million and $225.0 million, respectively, at any one time outstanding, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had $136.0 million and $63.1 million outstanding under the Credit Facility, respectively. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, we had approximately $34.0 million and $161.9 million, respectively, of remaining commitments and $34.0 million and $95.0 million, respectively, of availability on the Credit Facility.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the MS Credit Facility allowed 2010 Issuer to borrow up to $300.0 million at any one time outstanding, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. As of September 30, 2018, we had $234.7 million outstanding under the MS Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2018, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, we had approximately $65.3 million of remaining commitments and $6.7 million of availability on the MS Credit Facility.\nOn June 22, 2016, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with GC Advisors, or the Adviser Revolver, which permits us to borrow up to $20.0 million at any one time outstanding. We entered into the Adviser Revolver in order to have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis and have in the past repaid, and generally intend in the future to repay, borrowings under the Adviser Revolver within the same quarter in which they are drawn. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had no amounts outstanding on the Adviser Revolver.\nOn July 16, 2010, we completed the 2010 Debt Securitization, which was subsequently increased to $350.0 million. On October 20, 2016, we further amended the 2010 Debt Securitization to, among other things, (a) refinance the issued Class A 2010 Notes, by redeeming in full the $203.0 million Class A 2010 Notes and issuing new Class A-Refi 2010 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $205.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.90%, (b) refinance the Class B 2010 Notes by redeeming in full the $12.0 million Class B 2010 Notes and issuing new Class B-Refi 2010 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.40%, and (c) extend the reinvestment period applicable to the 2010 Issuer to July 20, 2018. Following the refinancing, Golub Capital BDC 2010-1 Holdings LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, or Holdings, retained the Class B-Refi 2010 Notes.\nAs of September 30, 2017, the 2010 Notes consisted of $205.0 million of Class A-Refi 2010 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.90%, $10.0 million of Class B-Refi 2010 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.40%, and $135.0 million face amount of Subordinated 2010 Notes that did not bear interest. The Class A-Refi 2010 Notes are included in the September 30, 2017 Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as our debt and the Class B-Refi 2010 Notes and Subordinated 2010 Notes were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2017, we had outstanding debt under the 2010 Debt Securitization of $205.0 million. On July 20, 2018, the 2010 Notes were redeemed and, following such redemption, the agreements governing the 2010 Debt Securitization were terminated.\nOn June 5, 2014, we completed the 2014 Debt Securitization in which the 2014 Issuer issued an aggregate of $402.6 million of notes, or the 2014 Notes, including, prior to their redemption on March 23, 2018, $191.0 million of Class A-1 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.75%, $20.0 million of Class A-2 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.95%, $35.0 million of Class B 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.50%, $37.5 million of Class C 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.50%, and $119.1 million of LLC equity interests in the 2014 Issuer that do not bear interest. We retained all of the Class C 2014 Notes and LLC equity interests in the 2014 Issuer totaling $37.5 million and $119.1 million, respectively. On March 23, 2018, we amended the 2014 Debt Securitization to, among other things, (a) refinance the issued Class A-1 notes issued by the 2014 Issuer by redeeming in full the $191.0 million of Class A-1 2014 Notes and issuing new Class A-1-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $191.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.95%, (b) refinance the Class A-2 2014 Notes by redeeming in full the $20.0 million of Class A-2 2014 Notes and issuing new Class A-2-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.95%, (c) refinance the Class B 2014 Notes by redeeming in full the $35.0 million of Class B 2014\nNotes and issuing new Class B-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, (d) refinance the Class C 2014 Notes by redeeming in full the $37.5 million of Class C 2014 Notes and issuing new Class C-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $37.5 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.55%. The Class C-R 2014 Notes were retained by us, and we remain the sole owner of the equity of the 2014 Issuer.\nThe Class A-1-R, Class A-2-R and Class B-R 2014 Notes are included in the September 30, 2018 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as our debt and the Class C-R 2014 Notes and LLC equity interests in the 2014 Issuer were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2018, we had outstanding debt under the 2014 Debt Securitization of $197.5 million.

As of September 30, 2017, we had outstanding debt under the 2014 Debt Securitization of $246.0 million.\nUnder present SBIC regulations, the maximum amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that may be issued by multiple licensees under common management is $350.0 million and the maximum amount that a single SBIC licensee may issue is $175.0 million. As of September 30, 2018, SBIC IV, SBIC V and SBIC VI, had $115.0 million, $150.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively, of outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures that mature between September 2021 and March 2028, leaving incremental debenture commitments of $0.0 million, $0.0 million and $37.5 million for SBIC IV, SBIC V and SBIC VI, respectively, under present SBIC regulations. As of September 30, 2017, SBIC IV, SBIC V and SBIC VI had $125.0 million, $133.0 million and $9.0 million, respectively, of outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures that mature between September 2021 and September 2027 leaving incremental debenture commitments of $0.0 million, $17.0 million and $41.0 million for SBIC IV, SBIC V and SBIC VI, respectively, under present SBIC regulations. The original amount committed to SBIC IV by the SBA was $150.0 million. In March 2018 and September 2017, SBIC IV repaid $10.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, of the aggregate principal amount of the SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding at the time and $10.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, of debenture commitments were terminated.\nIn August 2018, our board of directors reapproved a share repurchase program, or the Program, which allows us to repurchase up to $75.0 million of our outstanding common stock on the open market at prices below the NAV per share as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements. The Program may be implemented at the discretion of management. The shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market transactions, including block transactions. We did not make any repurchases of our common stock during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nOn July 18, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a third party institutional investor for the sale of 1,433,486 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $17.44 per share. On July 21, 2016, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds of $25.0 million were received.\nOn August 15, 2016, we priced a public offering of 1,750,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.35 per share, raising approximately $32.1 million in gross proceeds. On August 19, 2016, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before expenses, of $31.1 million were received. On September 19, 2016, we sold an additional 136,970 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.35 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of the option granted in connection with the public offering in August 2016.\nOn March 21, 2017, we priced a public offering of 1,750,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $19.03 per share, raising approximately $33.3 million in gross proceeds. On March 24, 2017, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds, net of offering costs but before expenses, of $32.3 million were received. On April 6, 2017, we sold an additional 262,500 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of\n$19.03 per share pursuant to the underwriter's exercise of the option granted in connection with the March 2017 offering. On June 6, 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell 1,750,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to an underwritten, public offering at a price to us of $18.71 per share. On June 12, 2017, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds, net of offering costs but before expenses, of $32.7 million were received. On July 5, 2017, we sold an additional 220,221 shares of our common stock pursuant to the underwriter's partial exercise of the option we granted in connection with the sale of shares in June 2017.\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are currently allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. The Small Business Credit Availability Act, or SBCAA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to business development companies from 200% to 150% so long as the business development company meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a business development company to have a ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200% asset coverage requirement. Effectiveness of the reduced asset coverage requirement to a business development company requires approval by either (1) a required majority,\u201d as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act, of such business development company's board of directors with effectiveness one year after the date of such approval or (2) a majority of votes cast at a special or annual meeting of such business development company's stockholders at which a quorum is present, which is effective the day after such stockholder approval. On November 27, 2018, our board of directors recommended that we seek shareholder approval to reduce our asset coverage requirement to 150.0% at our annual meeting of stockholders currently scheduled for February 5, 2019. To the extent stockholder approval is received, we currently intend to target a GAAP debt-to-equity ratio of about 1.0x.\nOn September 13, 2011, we received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing us to modify the asset coverage requirement to exclude the SBA debentures from our asset coverage calculation. As such, our ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 200% even if we do not approve the modified asset coverage requirement permitted by Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. This provides us with increased investment flexibility but also increases our risks related to leverage. As of September 30, 2018, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 269.5% (excluding the SBA debentures).\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments, excluding our investments in SLF, totaling $57.7 million and $60.5 million, respectively. These amounts may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers, subject to the terms of each loan's respective credit agreement. As of September 30, 2018, we believe that we had sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under our unfunded commitments based on historical rates of drawings upon unfunded commitments, cash and restricted cash balances that we maintain, availability under our Credit Facility, MS Credit Facility and Adviser Revolver, and ongoing principal repayments on debt investments. In addition, we generally hold some syndicated loans in larger portfolio companies that are saleable over a relatively short period to generate cash.\nAs the reinvestment period for our 2014 Debt Securitization expired on April 28, 2018, we are continuing to\nexplore expanding our secured debt financing facilities or entering into new secured debt financings, including term\ndebt securitizations and on November 16, 2018, we completed the 2018 Debt Securitization. See \"- Recent Developments.\u201d\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future securities offerings and through our DRIP as well as future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our efforts to raise capital will be successful. In addition, we may, from time to time, amend or refinance our leverage facilities and securitization financings, to the extent permitted by applicable law. In addition to capital not being available, it also may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent we are not able to raise capital on what we believe are favorable terms, we will focus on optimizing returns by investing capital generated from repayments into new investments we believe are attractive from a risk/reward perspective. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we may receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors' allocation policy and have, in the past, received such smaller allocations under similar circumstances.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had investments in 199 and 185 portfolio companies, respectively, with a total fair value of $1,711.8 million and $1,590.0 million, respectively, and had investments in SLF with a total fair value of $71.1 million and $95.0 million, respectively.\nThe following table shows the asset mix of our new investment commitments for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nCommitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nCommitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nCommitments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop\n</td> <td>534,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>447,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>505,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes in SLF(1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LLC equity interests in SLF(1)\n</td> <td>12,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>5,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total new investment commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>667,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>656,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Represents an amount less than 0.1%.\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>SLF's proceeds from the subordinated notes and LLC equity interests were utilized by SLF to invest in senior secured loans.

As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, $75.4 million and $97.5 million, respectively, of our LLC equity interest commitment to SLF had been called and contributed, net of return of capital distributions subject to recall. For the years ended September 30, 2018, and 2017, we received $8.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in dividend income from the SLF LLC equity interests.\nThe subordinated notes issued by SLF and previously held by us were redeemed on December 30, 2016, and therefore no interest income was earned for the year ended September 30, 2018. For the year ended September 30, 2017, we earned interest income of $1.6 million on the subordinated notes.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we earned a total return on our weighted average capital invested in SLF of 6.6% and 7.8%, respectively. The annualized total return on weighted average capital invested is\ncalculated by dividing total income earned on our investments in SLF by the combined daily average of our investments in (1) the principal of the SLF subordinated notes, if any, and (2) the NAV of the SLF LLC equity interests.\nBelow is certain summarized financial information for SLF as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017:\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Balance Sheet Information, at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments, at fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and other assets\n</td> <td>7,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior credit facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities\n</td> <td>484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities\n</td> <td>105,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Members' equity\n</td> <td>81,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities and members' equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Statement of Operations Information:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee income\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>18,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other debt financing expenses\n</td> <td>6,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative service fee\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>477\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>7,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>11,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains (losses) on investments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,379\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments\n</td> <td>(4,197\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in members' equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrior to their termination, SLF elected to fair value the subordinated notes issued to us and RGA under ASC Topic 825 - Financial Instruments, or ASC Topic 825.

These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments, excluding our investments in SLF, totaling $57.7 million and $60.5 million, respectively. We had commitments of up to $99.6 million and $77.5 million to SLF as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively, which may be contributed primarily for the purpose of funding new investments approved by the SLF investment committee.\nWe have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. We have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with GC Advisors in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, GC Advisors provides us with investment advisory and management services.\nUnder the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us with clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administrator also provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.\nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we receive under our Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nDistributions\nWe intend to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders as determined by our board of directors. For additional details on distributions, see Dividends and distributions\u201d in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification may result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.\nTo the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any tax year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nTable 271: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with GC Advisors.

For example, GC Advisors presently serves as the investment adviser to Golub Capital Investment Corporation and Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc., each an unlisted business development company that primarily focuses on investing in one stop and other senior secured loans. In addition, our officers and directors serve in similar capacities for Golub Capital Investment Corporation and Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. GC Advisors and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other accounts. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, and pursuant to GC Advisors' allocation policy, GC Advisors or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other accounts. We do not intend to make any investments if they are not permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, or if they are inconsistent with GC Advisors' allocation procedures.\nIn addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our and GC Advisors' officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under our valuation policy and process.\nValuation methods may include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, determination of the enterprise value of a portfolio company, discounted cash flow analysis and a market interest rate approach. The factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples; security covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company's ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows and the markets in which it does business; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and the principal market and enterprise values. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from values that may ultimately be received or settled.\nOur board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nOur quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of GC Advisors responsible for credit monitoring. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and GC Advisors. The audit committee of our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations. At least once annually the valuation for each portfolio investment, subject to a de minimis threshold, is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith.\nDetermination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Under current accounting standards, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe follow ASC Topic 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the assets or liabilities or market and the assets' or liabilities' complexity. Our fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Assets and liabilities are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information available and may require significant management judgment or estimation.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset's or a liability's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability. We assess the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The following section describes the valuation techniques used by us to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized.\nValuation of Investments\nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with approximately 25% (based on the number of portfolio companies) of our valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm. As of September 30, 2018 and\nSeptember 30, 2017, with the exception of money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (Level 1 investments) and investments measured at fair value using the NAV, all investments were valued using Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, we may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA. A portfolio company's EBITDA may include pro-forma adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, we will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, we use a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, we may base our valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. We generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nOur investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFair value of our debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using comparable market rates or market quotes for similar instruments at the measurement date, if available.\nRevenue Recognition:\nOur revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nInvestments and Related Investment Income: Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments. Premiums, discounts, and origination fees are amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment. For investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not likely to be collectible. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees and prepayment premiums on loans and record these fees as fee income when earned. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from LLC and limited partnership, or LP, investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of\ncapital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nWe account for investment transactions on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We report changes in fair value of investments from the prior period that is measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNon-accrual: Loans may be left on accrual status during the period we are pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on non-accrual status. We generally reverse accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment. We restore non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in our management's judgment, are likely to remain current. The total fair value of our non-accrual loans was $5.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and $3.0 million as of September 30, 2017.\nPartial loan sales: We follow the guidance in ASC Topic 860, when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. Such guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a participating interest\u201d, as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales that do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain on our statements of assets and liabilities and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are carried at fair value.\nIncome taxes: See Consolidated Results of Operations - Expenses - Excise Tax Expense.\u201d", "item_7_truncated": " \u2022 We have entered into the Adviser Revolver with GC Advisors in order to have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis. \nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset's or a liability's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability. We assess the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The following section describes the valuation techniques used by us to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized.\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>7.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop\n</td> <td>8.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien\n</td> <td>10.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>15.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes in SLF(1)\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs the reinvestment period for our 2014 Debt Securitization expired on April 28, 2018, we are continuing to\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2018 is as follows:\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SLF Investment Portfolio as of September 30, 2018 - (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Business Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment\nType\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current\nInterest\nRate(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal ($) /\nShares(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\nValue(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RSC Acquisition, Inc.(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11/2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RSC Acquisition, Inc.(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11/2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rubio's Restaurants, Inc.(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beverage, Food and Tobacco\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10/2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rug Doctor LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Personal and Non Durable Consumer Products (Mfg.

The borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. 3 Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased somewhat since origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due. 2 Involves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). 1 Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent.

We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders that will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, SLF had the following commitments from its members (in the aggregate):\n \u2022 GC Advisors serves as collateral manager to the 2014 Issuer and the 2018 Issuer under the 2014 Collateral Management Agreement and the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, respectively, and prior to the redemption of the 2010 Notes on July 20, 2018, served as the collateral manager to the 2010 Issuer under the 2010 Collateral Management Agreement.

We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variances\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other debt financing expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>3,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base management fee\n</td> <td>24,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income incentive fee\n</td> <td>11,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,281\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital gain incentive fee\n</td> <td>1,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,361\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>2,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(418\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative service fee\n</td> <td>2,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt outstanding(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>822,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>872,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>826,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50,157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn June 5, 2014, we completed the 2014 Debt Securitization in which the 2014 Issuer issued an aggregate of $402.6 million of notes, or the 2014 Notes, including, prior to their redemption on March 23, 2018, $191.0 million of Class A-1 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.75%, $20.0 million of Class A-2 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.95%, $35.0 million of Class B 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.50%, $37.5 million of Class C 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.50%, and $119.1 million of LLC equity interests in the 2014 Issuer that do not bear interest.

the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our efforts to raise capital will be successful. In addition, we may, from time to time, amend or refinance our leverage facilities and securitization financings, to the extent permitted by applicable law. In addition to capital not being available, it also may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent we are not able to raise capital on what we believe are favorable terms, we will focus on optimizing returns by investing capital generated from repayments into new investments we believe are attractive from a risk/reward perspective. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we may receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors' allocation policy and have, in the past, received such smaller allocations under similar circumstances.\nAs of September 30, 2017, the 2010 Notes consisted of $205.0 million of Class A-Refi 2010 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.90%, $10.0 million of Class B-Refi 2010 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.40%, and $135.0 million face amount of Subordinated 2010 Notes that did not bear interest.

The factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples; security covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company's ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows and the markets in which it does business; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and the principal market and enterprise values. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from values that may ultimately be received or settled.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nFor any investment rated 1, 2 or 3, GC Advisors will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions.\nOn November 27, 2018, our board of directors recommended that we seek shareholder approval to reduce our asset coverage requirement to 150.0% at our annual meeting of stockholders currently scheduled for February 5, 2019. To the extent stockholder approval is received, we currently intend to target a GAAP debt-to-equity ratio of about 1.0x.\nOur internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments.\nUnder the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, the term \u2018\u2018collection period'' refers to a quarterly period commencing on the third business day prior to the preceding collection period to the and ending on (but excluding) the third business day prior to the payment date.

The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers, subject to the terms of each loan's respective credit agreement. As of September 30, 2018, we believe that we had sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under our unfunded commitments based on historical rates of drawings upon unfunded commitments, cash and restricted cash balances that we maintain, availability under our Credit Facility, MS Credit Facility and Adviser Revolver, and ongoing principal repayments on debt investments. In addition, we generally hold some syndicated loans in larger portfolio companies that are saleable over a relatively short period to generate cash.\n\n\nOur board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\n \u2022 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; \nWe co-invest with RGA Reinsurance Company, or RGA, in senior secured loans through SLF, an unconsolidated Delaware LLC.

The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but we are showing this amount in the less than one year category as this entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of September 30, 2018, subject to the terms of each loan's respective credit agreement.  We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments, excluding our investments in SLF, totaling $57.7 million and $60.5 million, respectively. We had commitments of up to $99.6 million and $77.5 million to SLF as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively, which may be contributed primarily for the purpose of funding new investments approved by the SLF investment committee.\n (4) Proceeds from the LLC equity interests invested in SLF were utilized by SLF to invest in senior secured loans.  As of September 30, 2018 we had three debt investments on non-accrual status and non-accrual investments as a percentage of total investments at cost and fair value were 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. As of September 30, 2017, we had three debt investments on non-accrual status and non-accrual investments as a percentage of total investments at cost and fair value were 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively.

On October 20, 2016, we further amended the 2010 Debt Securitization to, among other things, (a) refinance the issued Class A 2010 Notes, by redeeming in full the $203.0 million Class A 2010 Notes and issuing new Class A-Refi 2010 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $205.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.90%, (b) refinance the Class B 2010 Notes by redeeming in full the $12.0 million Class B 2010 Notes and issuing new Class B-Refi 2010 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.40%, and (c) extend the reinvestment period applicable to the 2010 Issuer to July 20, 2018. Following the refinancing, Golub Capital BDC 2010-1 Holdings LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, or Holdings, retained the Class B-Refi 2010 Notes.\n\nOn November 16, 2018, we completed the 2018 Debt Securitization. The 2018 Notes were issued by the 2018 Issuer and are backed by a diversified portfolio of senior secured and second lien loans. The transaction was executed through a private placement of approximately $327.0 million of AAA/AAA Class A 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 1.48%; $61.2 million of AA Class B 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.10%; $20.0 million of A Class C-1 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.80%; $38.8 million of A Class C-2 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.65%; $42.0 million of BBB- Class D 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.95%; and $113.4 million of Subordinated 2018 Notes which do not bear interest. We indirectly retained all of the Class C-2, Class D and Subordinated 2018 Notes. The 2018 Notes are scheduled to mature on January 20, 2031.\n \nPartial loan sales: We follow the guidance in ASC Topic 860, when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. Such guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a participating interest\u201d, as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales that do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain on our statements of assets and liabilities and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are carried at fair value.\n (2) Computed as the (a) annual stated interest rate on accruing senior secured loans divided by (b) total senior secured loans at principal amount. \nThe 2018 Notes are the secured obligations of the 2018 Issuer, and an indenture governing the 2018 Notes includes customary covenants and events of default.

Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\n (5) Loan was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2018, meaning that SLF has ceased recognizing interest income on the loan. \nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, which was most recently reapproved by our board of directors in May 2018, we have agreed to pay GC Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by an administrator, or the Administrator, which is currently Golub Capital LLC. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\n (6) Equity investment received as a result of the portfolio company's debt restructuring. \n \u2022 U.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees; \nSome of the statements in this annual report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition.

For example, GC Advisors presently serves as the investment adviser to Golub Capital Investment Corporation and Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc., each an unlisted business development company that primarily focuses on investing in one stop and other senior secured loans. In addition, our officers and directors serve in similar capacities for Golub Capital Investment Corporation and Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. GC Advisors and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other accounts. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, and pursuant to GC Advisors' allocation policy, GC Advisors or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other accounts. We do not intend to make any investments if they are not permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, or if they are inconsistent with GC Advisors' allocation procedures.\n \u2022 the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position. \nInvestments and Related Investment Income: Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments. Premiums, discounts, and origination fees are amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment. For investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not likely to be collectible. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees and prepayment premiums on loans and record these fees as fee income when earned. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from LLC and limited partnership, or LP, investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of\nIn connection with the closing of the merger, it is our board of directors' intention to increase the dividend per quarter to $0.33 per share; provided that our board of directors' reserves the right to revisit this intention if market conditions or our prospects meaningfully change.\n (8) Equity investment received as a result of the portfolio company's debt restructuring. \nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, SLF had total assets at fair value of $186.3 million and $306.2 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2018, SLF had one portfolio company investment on non-accrual status with a fair value of $3.9 million. As of September 30, 2017, SLF had one portfolio company investment on non-accrual status with a fair value of $0.3 million. The portfolio companies in SLF are in industries and geographies similar to those in which we may invest directly. Additionally, as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, SLF had commitments to fund various undrawn revolving credit and delayed draw loans to its portfolio companies totaling $5.9 million and $13.3 million, respectively.\nLevel 3: Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities.

Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2016 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments and the reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation associated with the non-accrual portfolio company investments that were sold and written-off. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the amortization of discounts, negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value and the reversal of the net unrealized appreciation associated with the sales of portfolio company investments.\ncompany and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code.\nAmortization of debt issuance costs remained relatively stable from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018 as new debt issuance costs associated with the new or amended debt facilities were offset by the full amortization of previous costs incurred. Amortization of debt issuance costs declined from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017 as initial debt issuance costs associated with $125.0 million of SBIC IV debentures fully amortized.\nOur revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nThe following table summarizes our expenses for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\n \u2022 Golub Capital LLC provides, and other affiliates of Golub Capital have historically provided, us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our Administration Agreement. \nIn total, professional fees, the administrative service fee, and general and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018 and decreased by $0.2 million from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017. In general, we expect certain of our operating expenses, including professional fees, the administrative service fee, and other general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets during periods of growth and increase as a percentage of our total assets during periods of asset declines.\nMarket Environment: We believe that as part of the path of economic recovery following the credit crisis, there has been increased competition for new middle-market investments due to some new non-bank finance companies that have entered the market and due to improving financial performance of middle-market companies. However, we believe that our scale and strong market position will continue to allow us to find investment opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n \nExpenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, we may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA. A portfolio company's EBITDA may include pro-forma adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, we will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, we use a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses were $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for accrued expenses paid on behalf of us by the Administrator.\n \u2022 calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); \nDemand for Debt Capital. We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and subordinated debt from other sources, such as us.\nOur investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are currently allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. The Small Business Credit Availability Act, or SBCAA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to business development companies from 200% to 150% so long as the business development company meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a business development company to have a ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200% asset coverage requirement. Effectiveness of the reduced asset coverage requirement to a business development company requires approval by either (1) a required majority,\u201d as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act, of such business development company's board of directors with effectiveness one year after the date of such approval or (2) a majority of votes cast at a special or annual meeting of such business development company's stockholders at which a quorum is present, which is effective the day after such stockholder approval. On November 27, 2018, our board of directors recommended that we seek shareholder approval to reduce our asset coverage requirement to 150.0% at our annual meeting of stockholders currently scheduled for February 5, 2019. To the extent stockholder approval is received, we currently intend to target a GAAP debt-to-equity ratio of about 1.0x.\nOn March 21, 2017, we priced a public offering of 1,750,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $19.03 per share, raising approximately $33.3 million in gross proceeds. On March 24, 2017, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds, net of offering costs but before expenses, of $32.3 million were received. On April 6, 2017, we sold an additional 262,500 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of\n \n \u2022 transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses; \nWe account for investment transactions on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We report changes in fair value of investments from the prior period that is measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \u2022 U.S. federal, state and local taxes; \nWe have based the forward-looking statements included in this report on information available to us on the date of this report. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. This annual report on Form 10-K contains statistics and other data that have been obtained from or compiled from information made available by third-party service providers. We have not independently verified such statistics or data.\n \n \u2022 costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators; \n \u2022 the ability of GC Advisors to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; \n\n (7) Loan was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2017, meaning that SLF has ceased recognizing interest income on the loan. \n (2) Does not include our investment in LLC equity interests in SLF.  Net income can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, annual comparisons of net income may not be meaningful.\nBelow is certain summarized financial information for SLF as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017:\nWe follow ASC Topic 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the assets or liabilities or market and the assets' or liabilities' complexity. Our fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Assets and liabilities are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\n (10) The entire commitment was unfunded as of September 30, 2017. As such, no interest is being earned on this investment.  As of September 30, 2018, we have committed to fund $175.0 million of LLC equity interests to SLF. As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, $75.4 million and $97.5 million, respectively, of our LLC equity interest commitment to SLF had been called and contributed, net of return of capital distributions subject to recall. For the years ended September 30, 2018, and 2017, we received $8.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in dividend income from the SLF LLC equity interests.\n\n (7) Non-income producing securities. \nAs a result of the merger, we will be subject to certain additional risks, which will be set forth in the joint proxy statement/prospectus for the merger that we anticipate filing with the SEC in December 2018.\nWe believe that these administrative expenses approximate the amount of ongoing fees and expenses that we would be required to pay in connection with a traditional secured credit facility. Our common stockholders indirectly bear all of these expenses.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, we may base our valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. We generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment.\nOn August 15, 2016, we priced a public offering of 1,750,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.35 per share, raising approximately $32.1 million in gross proceeds. On August 19, 2016, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before expenses, of $31.1 million were received. On September 19, 2016, we sold an additional 136,970 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.35 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of the option granted in connection with the public offering in August 2016.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $16.9 million. During the period, cash used in operating activities was $8.6 million, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $646.6 million, partially offset by the proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $558.7 million and net investment income of $76.0 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $8.3 million, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $760.5 million that were partially offset by repayments of debt of $695.9 million and distributions paid of $71.1 million.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we had $2.0 million in unrealized appreciation on our investment in SLF LLC equity interests. Unrealized appreciation on the SLF LLC equity interests was primarily driven by increased net investment income at SLF.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had investments in 199 and 185 portfolio companies, respectively, with a total fair value of $1,711.8 million and $1,590.0 million, respectively, and had investments in SLF with a total fair value of $71.1 million and $95.0 million, respectively.\n (2) The total principal amount is presented for debt investments while the number of shares or units owned is presented for equity investments. \nInterest and other debt financing expenses increased by $4.7 million from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017 primarily due to the increase in the weighted average of outstanding borrowings from $826.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to $873.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 and an increase in the effective annual interest rate. The effective average interest rate on our outstanding debt increased to 3.6% for the year ended September 30, 2017 from 3.4% for the year ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the increase in LIBOR.\n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business. \nValuation of Investments\n \nThe following table shows the weighted average income yield and weighted average investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented nearly 100% of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value, and the total return based on the change in the quoted market price of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, in each case for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\n \u2022 proxy voting expenses; and \nAs of September 30, 2018, SLF is capitalized by LLC equity interest subscriptions from its members. On December 14, 2016, the SLF investment committee approved the recapitalization of the commitments of SLF's members. On December 30, 2016, SLF's members entered into additional LLC equity interest subscriptions totaling $160.0 million, SLF issued capital calls totaling $89.9 million to us and RGA and the subordinated notes previously issued by SLF were redeemed and terminated. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we and RGA owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the LLC equity interests. SLF's profits and losses are allocated to us and RGA in accordance with our respective ownership interests.\n \u2022 We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with GC Advisors. Mr. Lawrence Golub, our chairman, is a manager of GC Advisors, and Mr. David Golub, our chief executive officer, is a manager of GC Advisors, and each of Messrs. Lawrence Golub and David Golub owns an indirect pecuniary interest in GC Advisors. \nIncentive Fees\nCollateral management fees were paid directly by the 2010 Issuer and are paid by the 2014 Issuer to GC Advisors and are offset against the management fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In addition, the 2010 Issuer and 2014 Issuer paid Wells Fargo Securities, LLC structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the initial structuring and subsequent amendments to the 2010 Debt Securitization and the initial structuring of the 2014 Debt Securitization. Term debt securitizations are also known as collateralized loan obligations and are a form of secured financing incurred by us, which is consolidated by us and subject to our overall asset coverage requirement. The 2010 Issuer, the 2014 Issuer and 2018 Issuer also agreed to pay ongoing administrative expenses to the trustee, collateral manager, independent accountants, legal counsel, rating agencies and independent managers in connection with developing and maintaining reports, and providing required services in connection with the administration of the 2010 Debt Securitization, the 2014 Debt Securitization, and 2018 Debt Securitization, and collectively the Debt Securitizations, as applicable.\nBelow is a summary of SLF's portfolio, followed by a listing of the individual investments in SLF's portfolio as of September 30, 2018 and 2017:\n \u2022 our allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; \nOur investment activities are managed by GC Advisors and supervised by our board of directors of which a majority of the members are independent of us, GC Advisors and its affiliates.\nOverview\n * Represents an amount less than 0.1%. \nRevenue Recognition:\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment or derivative instrument, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized.

For the year ended September 30, 2016, we have excluded $0.5 million of secured borrowings, at fair value, which were the result of participations and partial loan sales that did not meet the definition of a participating interest\u201d, as defined in the guidance to Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 860 - Transfers and Servicing, or ASC Topic 860.  Interest Expense\n (5) The negative fair value is the result of the unfunded commitment being valued below par. \nOn November 27, 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.32 per share and a special distribution of $0.12 per share both of which are payable on December 28, 2018 to holders of record as of December 12, 2018.\n \u2022 actual and potential conflicts of interest with GC Advisors LLC, or GC Advisors, and other affiliates of Golub Capital LLC, collectively, Golub Capital; \n (1) 27 and 19 of our loans included a feature permitting a portion of the interest due on such loan to be PIK interest as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nAs of September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had debt and equity investments in 199, 185 and 183 portfolio companies, respectively, and an investment in SLF.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $27.0 million. During the period, cash provided by operating activities was $62.2 million, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $588.2 million, partially offset by the proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $588.2 million and net investment income of $69.5 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $89.2 million, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $545.0 million and net proceeds of an aggregate of $74.0 million from two equity offerings that were offset by repayments of debt of $628.6 million and distributions paid of $76.8 million.\nExcise Tax Expense\n \n \u2022 the impact on our business of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder and any actions toward repeal thereof; and \n\nAs part of the monitoring process, GC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. This system is not generally accepted in our industry or used by our competitors. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as GC Advisors' internal performance ratings:\nMarket Trends\nSeptember 30, 2017, with the exception of money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (Level 1 investments) and investments measured at fair value using the NAV, all investments were valued using Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year in an amount less than what would trigger payments of U.S. federal income tax under Subchapter M of the Code. We may then be required to incur a 4% excise tax on such income. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income may exceed estimated current year distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred a net expense of $0, $17,000 and $333,000, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax.\n\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under our valuation policy and process.\nInterest and other debt financing expenses increased by $1.6 million from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the increase in LIBOR which was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average of outstanding borrowings from $873.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 to $822.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in our debt was primarily driven by a decrease in the weighted average of outstanding borrowings on the Credit Facility from $138.8 million as of September 30, 2017 to $103.0 million as of September 30, 2018. The effective average interest rate on our outstanding debt\nDistributions\n (3) Represents the fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurement, or ASC Topic 820. The determination of such fair value is not included in our board of directors' valuation process described elsewhere herein. \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n (2) Represents income from interest, including subordinated notes in SLF, and fees, excluding amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us. \nThe subordinated notes issued by SLF and previously held by us were redeemed on December 30, 2016, and therefore no interest income was earned for the year ended September 30, 2018. For the year ended September 30, 2017, we earned interest income of $1.6 million on the subordinated notes.\ninvestments that meet the regulatory and investment guidelines established by the SBA for our SBICs, which are described in further detail in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, and for interest expense and fees on our outstanding SBA debentures.\n \u2022 general economic and political trends and other external factors; \nOn June 22, 2016, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with GC Advisors, or the Adviser Revolver, which permits us to borrow up to $20.0 million at any one time outstanding. We entered into the Adviser Revolver in order to have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis and have in the past repaid, and generally intend in the future to repay, borrowings under the Adviser Revolver within the same quarter in which they are drawn. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had no amounts outstanding on the Adviser Revolver.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle-market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies. We may also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in U.S. middle-market companies. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to U.S. middle-market companies with over $25.0 billion in capital under management as of September 30, 2018, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we had $6.3 million in net realized gains on investments, primarily due to the sale of, or capital gain distributions received from, several equity investments and the sale of debt investments to SLF that were partially offset by the realized loss on the sale of one non-accrual portfolio company investment and the write off of one non-accrual portfolio company investment.\nThe income yield by debt security type for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\n (1) For the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average income yield and weighted average investment income yield do not reflect interest income from subordinated notes in SLF, which were redeemed on December 30, 2016. \n (5) Total return based on market value assumes distributions are reinvested in accordance with the DRIP. Total return does not include sales load.  Revenues: We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, second lien or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are\n (1) For the year ended September 30, 2018, the investment in SLF represents the investment in LLC equity interests in SLF. For the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, the investments in SLF include our investments in both subordinated notes (prior to their redemption by SLF on December 30, 2016) and LLC equity interests in SLF. \n (4) We also hold a portion of the senior secured loan in this portfolio company. \nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe base management fee increased as a result of a sequential increase in average adjusted gross assets from 2016 to 2018.\nRecent Developments\nOn July 18, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a third party institutional investor for the sale of 1,433,486 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $17.44 per share. On July 21, 2016, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds of $25.0 million were received.\n\n \n \nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we receive under our Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nLevel 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n (2) We refer to a loan as non-accrual when we cease recognizing interest income on the loan because we have stopped pursuing repayment of the loan or, in certain circumstances, it is past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or our management has reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. See - Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition.\u201d \nOur shares are currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol GBDC\u201d.\nGC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the internal performance ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, GC Advisors and our board of directors review these internal performance ratings on a quarterly basis.\nWe intend to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders as determined by our board of directors. For additional details on distributions, see Dividends and distributions\u201d in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Administrator pays for certain expenses incurred by us. These expenses are subsequently reimbursed in cash. Total expenses reimbursed by us to the Administrator for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $2.4 million, $2.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nOn November 27, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to merge with GCIC with us as the surviving entity. Our board of directors and the board of directors of GCIC, including all of the respective independent directors, have approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein. Under the terms of the proposed merger, stockholders of GCIC will receive 0.865 shares of our stock for each share of GCIC, subject to adjustment only in the event of reclassification, recapitalization, or similar transaction by either company. The combined company will remain externally managed by GC Advisors and our officers and directors will remain in their current roles. The combined company will continue to trade under the ticker GBDC on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Consummation of the proposed merger is subject to our and GCIC stockholder approvals, customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Assuming satisfaction of these conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019.\nGC Advisors, will serve as collateral manager to the 2018 Issuer under a collateral management agreement and will receive a fee for providing these services in an amount equal to 0.25% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2018 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the total fees paid to GC Advisors for rendering collateral management services, which are less than the management fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, will be offset against such management fee.\nIn August 2018, our board of directors reapproved a share repurchase program, or the Program, which allows us to repurchase up to $75.0 million of our outstanding common stock on the open market at prices below the NAV per share as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements. The Program may be implemented at the discretion of management. The shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market transactions, including block transactions. We did not make any repurchases of our common stock during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following:\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities\n \u2022 costs associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; \n \u2022 During the first nine months of the calendar year 2018, the Golub Capital Employee Grant Program Rabbi Trust, or the Trust, purchased approximately $7.2 million of shares, or 396,099 shares, of our common stock for the purpose of awarding incentive compensation to employees of Golub Capital. During calendar year 2017, the Trust purchased approximately $17.7 million of shares, or 955,896 shares, of our common stock, for the purpose of awarding incentive compensation to employees of Golub Capital. \nOur quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of GC Advisors responsible for credit monitoring. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and GC Advisors. The audit committee of our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations. At least once annually the valuation for each portfolio investment, subject to a de minimis threshold, is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith.\n \u2022 the effect of investments that we expect to make and the competition for those investments; \nIncome taxes: See Consolidated Results of Operations - Expenses - Excise Tax Expense.\u201d\n (1) SLF's proceeds from the subordinated notes were utilized by SLF to invest in senior secured loans. SLF redeemed the outstanding balance on the subordinated notes on December 30, 2016.  Income yields on one stop and senior secured loans increased for the year ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the rise in LIBOR. As of September 30, 2018, we have one second lien investment and two subordinated debt investments as shown in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. Due to the limited number of second lien and subordinated debt investments, annual income yields on second lien and subordinated debt investments can be significantly impacted by the addition, subtraction or refinancing of one investment.\n \nSenior Loan Fund LLC\n (6) The entire commitment was unfunded as of September 30, 2017. As such, no interest is being earned on this investment. \n (1) SLF's proceeds from the subordinated notes and LLC equity interests were utilized by SLF to invest in senior secured loans. As of September 30, 2018, SLF had investments in senior secured loans to 32 different borrowers.  For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately $495.5 million, $449.8 million and $366.2 million, excluding $78.7 million of proceeds from the repayment in full and termination of our investment in subordinated notes of SLF during the year ended 2017, respectively, in proceeds from principal payments and return of capital distributions of portfolio companies. For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had sales of investments in 21, 72 and 44 portfolio companies, respectively, aggregating approximately $37.6 million, $138.4 million and $172.2 million, respectively, in net proceeds.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we had $28.0 million in unrealized appreciation on 186 portfolio company investments, which was partially offset by $26.6 million in unrealized depreciation on 192 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2017 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments and the reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation associated with the non-accrual portfolio company investments that were sold and written-off. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the amortization of discounts, negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value and the reversal of the net unrealized appreciation associated with the sales of portfolio company investments.\nThe Class A-1-R, Class A-2-R and Class B-R 2014 Notes are included in the September 30, 2018 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as our debt and the Class C-R 2014 Notes and LLC equity interests in the 2014 Issuer were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2018, we had outstanding debt under the 2014 Debt Securitization of $197.5 million. The Class A-1, Class A-2 and Class B 2014 Notes are included in the September 30, 2017 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as our debt and the Class C 2014 Notes and LLC equity interests in the 2014 Issuer were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2017, we had outstanding debt under the 2014 Debt Securitization of $246.0 million.\n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; \nThe following table shows the asset mix of our new investment commitments for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n (1) Proceeds from the LLC equity interests invested in SLF were utilized by SLF to invest in senior secured loans.  One stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as late stage lending loans. Other targeted characteristics of late stage lending businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower's high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we may adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, one stop loans included $169.4 million and $138.6 million, respectively, of late stage lending loans at fair value.\n (2) As of September 30, 2016, the investment in SLF includes our investments in both subordinated notes and LLC equity interests in SLF. \nUnder the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us with clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administrator also provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.\n \nFor the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we earned a total return on our weighted average capital invested in SLF of 6.6% and 7.8%, respectively. The annualized total return on weighted average capital invested is\nexplore expanding our secured debt financing facilities or entering into new secured debt financings, including term\n (4) We also hold a portion of the senior secured loan in this portfolio company. \nCompetition from Bank Lenders. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We believe these factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore more market opportunities for us.\n\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, the portfolio median earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for our portfolio companies (excluding SLF) was $26.2 million and $25.2 million, respectively. The portfolio median EBITDA is based on the most recently reported trailing twelve-month EBITDA received from the portfolio company.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\n (3) The negative fair value is the result of the unfunded commitment being valued below par. \nWe have identified the following trends that may affect our business:\n \nOn November 1, 2018, the 2018 Issuer entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Golub Capital BDC CLO III Depositor LLC, as depositor, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as the initial purchaser, or the Initial Purchaser, pursuant to which the 2018 Issuer agreed to sell the 2018 Notes to the Initial Purchaser as part of the 2018 Debt Securitization. Term debt securitizations are also known as CLOs and are a form of secured financing incurred by the Company, which are consolidated by the Company and subject to its overall asset coverage requirement.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we had $25.1 million in unrealized appreciation on 158 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $34.8 million in unrealized depreciation on 169 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2018 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the reversal of the net unrealized appreciation associated with the sales of portfolio company investments, the amortization of discounts, and negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value.\nFair value of our debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using comparable market rates or market quotes for similar instruments at the measurement date, if available.\n \u2022 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we invest; \n (4) Total return based on average net asset value is calculated as (a) the net increase in net assets resulting from operations divided by (b) the daily average of total net assets. Total return does not include sales load. \nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively. In addition, we had foreign currencies of $0.2 million as of September 30, 2018 and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $39.7 million and $58.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents are available to fund new investments, pay operating expenses and pay distributions. As of September 30, 2018, $14.7 million of our restricted cash and cash equivalents will be used for the payment of principal and interest expense on the notes issued in the 2014 Debt Securitization, which is described in further detail in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2018, $5.8 million of our restricted cash and cash equivalents could be used to fund investments that meet the guidelines under the Credit Facility as well as for the payment of interest expense and revolving debt of the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2018, $8.1 million of our restricted cash and cash equivalents could be used to fund investments that meet the guidelines under the MS Credit Facility as well as for the payment of interest expense and revolving debt of the MS Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2018, $11.1 million of our restricted cash and cash equivalents could be used to fund new\n\n (1) At principal amount. \nManagement Fee\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes.\n * Represents an amount less than 0.1%. \n \u2022 We have entered into a license agreement with Golub Capital LLC, pursuant to which Golub Capital LLC has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Golub Capital.\u201d \n \u2022 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; \n \u2022 our ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a regulated investment company, or RIC,  and as a business development company;\nAdvisors sold to the 2018 Issuer all of its ownership interest in such portfolio loans for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement. Under the terms of the other loan sale agreement governing the 2018 Debt Securitization Depositor Loan Sale Agreement, which provides for the sale of assets on the Closing Date as well as future sales from us to the 2018 Issuer through CLO Depositor, (3) we sold and/or contributed to the CLO Depositor the remainder of its ownership interest in the portfolio company investments securing the 2018 Debt Securitization and participations for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the Depositor Loan Sale Agreement and (4) CLO Depositor, in turn, sold to the 2018 Issuer all of its ownership interest in such portfolio loans and participations for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in one of the loan sale agreements. Following these transfers, the 2018 Issuer, and neither GC Advisors, the CLO Depositor nor us, held all of the ownership interest in such portfolio company investments and participations. We made customary representations, warranties and covenants in these loan sale agreements.\n (3) Represents income from interest, including subordinated notes in SLF, fees and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us. \nOn September 13, 2011, we received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing us to modify the asset coverage requirement to exclude the SBA debentures from our asset coverage calculation. As such, our ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 200% even if we do not approve the modified asset coverage requirement permitted by Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. This provides us with increased investment flexibility but also increases our risks related to leverage. As of September 30, 2018, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 269.5% (excluding the SBA debentures).\n\n \nSuch forward-looking statements may include statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words may,\u201d might,\u201d will,\u201d intend,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d can,\u201d would,\u201d expect,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d anticipate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d plan\u201d or similar words.

During the period, cash used in operating activities was $56.1 million, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $654.8 million, partially offset by the proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $538.6 million and net investment income of $65.0 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $48.1 million, primarily due to net proceeds of an aggregate $58.6 million from one equity offering and one private placement and net borrowings on debt of $51.5 million, partially offset by distributions paid of $59.5 million.\n$19.03 per share pursuant to the underwriter's exercise of the option granted in connection with the March 2017 offering. On June 6, 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell 1,750,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to an underwritten, public offering at a price to us of $18.71 per share. On June 12, 2017, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds, net of offering costs but before expenses, of $32.7 million were received. On July 5, 2017, we sold an additional 220,221 shares of our common stock pursuant to the underwriter's partial exercise of the option we granted in connection with the sale of shares in June 2017.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017 we had a net realized gain on investments of $9.4 million primarily due to net realized gains on the sale of equity securities in 18 portfolio company investments and net gains on the sale of debt investments to SLF, which was partially offset by a net realized loss on the sale of a debt and equity investment in a single portfolio company.\nPrior to their termination, SLF elected to fair value the subordinated notes issued to us and RGA under ASC Topic 825 - Financial Instruments, or ASC Topic 825. As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, SLF had no subordinated notes outstanding.\nWe entered into two loan sale agreements which govern the 2018 Debt Securitization. Under the terms of the loan sale agreement entered into upon the Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement, which provides for the sale of assets on the Closing Date to satisfy risk retention requirements, (1) we transferred to GC Advisors a portion of our ownership interest in the portfolio company investments securing the 2018 Debt Securitization for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement and (2) immediately thereafter, GC\nConsolidated operating results for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\n \n (8) The entire commitment was unfunded as of September 30, 2018. As such, no interest is being earned on this investment. \nGC Advisors, as collateral manager for the 2014 Issuer, our wholly-owned subsidiary, under a collateral management agreement, or the 2014 Collateral Management Agreement, is entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.25% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2014 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2014 Collateral Management Agreement, the term \u2018\u2018collection period'' refers to a quarterly period running from the day after the end of the prior collection period to the tenth business day prior to the payment date.\nOn November 1, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the documents governing the MS Credit Facility. The MS Credit Facility amendment increased the borrowing capacity under the MS Credit Facility from $300.0 million to $450.0 million. The other material terms of the MS Credit Facility were unchanged.\nWe generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which may be referred to as junk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.\nA portion of the proceeds of the private placement of the 2018 Notes, net of expenses, was used to repay all amounts outstanding under the MS Credit Facility, following which the agreements governing the MS Credit Facility were terminated.\n (9) Non-income producing. \n \u2022 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; \ncapitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income.

We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Golub Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the MS Credit Facility allowed 2010 Issuer to borrow up to $300.0 million at any one time outstanding, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. As of September 30, 2018, we had $234.7 million outstanding under the MS Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2018, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, we had approximately $65.3 million of remaining commitments and $6.7 million of availability on the MS Credit Facility.\n\n \nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with approximately 25% (based on the number of portfolio companies) of our valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm.

Under the 2010 Collateral Management Agreement, the term \u2018\u2018collection period'' referred to a quarterly period running from the day after the end of the prior collection period to the fifth business day of the calendar month in which a payment date occurs. Following the redemption of the 2010 Notes on July 20, 2018, the 2010 Collateral Management Agreement was terminated.\nNon-accrual: Loans may be left on accrual status during the period we are pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on non-accrual status. We generally reverse accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment. We restore non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in our management's judgment, are likely to remain current. The total fair value of our non-accrual loans was $5.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and $3.0 million as of September 30, 2017.\n \u2022 the adequacy of our financing sources and working capital; \n\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we had $3.6 million in unrealized depreciation on our investments in SLF LLC equity interests. Unrealized depreciation on the SLF LLC equity interests was driven by negative credit related adjustments associated with SLF's investment portfolio that was primarily driven by one portfolio company investment taken to non-accrual status.\n\n \n \u2022 administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs); \nThe accrual for capital gain incentive fee under GAAP was $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2018, $2.8 million, or $0.05 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2017, and $1.2 million, or $0.03 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in accruals for a capital gain incentive fee under GAAP for the year ended September 30, 2018 from the year ended September 30, 2017 was primarily the result of unrealized depreciation of debt and equity investments. The increase in accruals for a capital gain incentive fee under GAAP for the year ended September 30, 2017 from the year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the\nNotes and issuing new Class B-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, (d) refinance the Class C 2014 Notes by redeeming in full the $37.5 million of Class C 2014 Notes and issuing new Class C-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $37.5 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.55%.

For the year ended September 30, 2018, we had a net realized gain on investments and foreign currency transactions of $17.5 million primarily due to realized gains on the sale of equity securities in more than 20 portfolio company investments, partially offset by the realized loss on the sale or disposition of three under-performing debt investments.\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 internal performance rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2018 and 2017:\nThe incentive fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement consists of two parts: (1) the Income Incentive Fee and (2) the Capital Gain Incentive Fee. The Income Incentive Fee increased by $6.9 million from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily as a result of the increase in net investment income. As the Company remains in the \"catch-up\" provision of the Income Incentive Fee calculation, the increase in net investment income causes a corresponding increase in the Income Incentive Fee until the Company is fully through the \"catch-up\" provision. The Income Incentive Fee decreased by $1.3 million from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017 as the interest rate compression on new investments and the decline of second lien and subordinated debt investments in our portfolio caused a decline in our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets. For the year ended September 30, 2018, while still not fully through the \"catch-up\" provision in any quarter of the Income Incentive Fee calculation, the Income Incentive Fee as a percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income increased to 18.7% compared to 6.1% for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 8.3% for the year ended September 30, 2016.", "item_7_text": " \u2022 We have entered into the Adviser Revolver with GC Advisors in order to have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis. \nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset's or a liability's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability. We assess the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The following section describes the valuation techniques used by us to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized.\nAs the reinvestment period for our 2014 Debt Securitization expired on April 28, 2018, we are continuing to\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2018 is as follows:\nExpenses\n (1) Funded LLC equity commitments are presented net of return of capital distributions subject to recall.

As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, SLF II had outstanding debt under the SLF Credit Facility of $104.6 million and $197.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2018 the SLF Credit Facility bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.05% per annum.\nIn addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our and GC Advisors' officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.\nWe seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by primarily investing approximately $5.0 million to $30.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of U.S. middle-market companies. We may also selectively invest more than $30.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.\nItem 7.

The original amount committed to SBIC IV by the SBA was $150.0 million. In March 2018 and September 2017, SBIC IV repaid $10.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, of the aggregate principal amount of the SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding at the time and $10.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, of debenture commitments were terminated.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification may result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.\nresult of unrealized appreciation of debt and equity investments.

The borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. 3 Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased somewhat since origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due. 2 Involves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). 1 Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 1 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. \nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, as well as timely distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid for each tax year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders that will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, SLF had the following commitments from its members (in the aggregate):\n \u2022 GC Advisors serves as collateral manager to the 2014 Issuer and the 2018 Issuer under the 2014 Collateral Management Agreement and the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, respectively, and prior to the redemption of the 2010 Notes on July 20, 2018, served as the collateral manager to the 2010 Issuer under the 2010 Collateral Management Agreement. Fees payable to GC Advisors for providing these services offset against the base management fee payable by us under the Investment Advisory Agreement. \nSpecialized Lending Requirements. We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nOn June 5, 2014, we completed the 2014 Debt Securitization in which the 2014 Issuer issued an aggregate of $402.6 million of notes, or the 2014 Notes, including, prior to their redemption on March 23, 2018, $191.0 million of Class A-1 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.75%, $20.0 million of Class A-2 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.95%, $35.0 million of Class B 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.50%, $37.5 million of Class C 2014 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.50%, and $119.1 million of LLC equity interests in the 2014 Issuer that do not bear interest. We retained all of the Class C 2014 Notes and LLC equity interests in the 2014 Issuer totaling $37.5 million and $119.1 million, respectively. On March 23, 2018, we amended the 2014 Debt Securitization to, among other things, (a) refinance the issued Class A-1 notes issued by the 2014 Issuer by redeeming in full the $191.0 million of Class A-1 2014 Notes and issuing new Class A-1-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $191.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.95%, (b) refinance the Class A-2 2014 Notes by redeeming in full the $20.0 million of Class A-2 2014 Notes and issuing new Class A-2-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.95%, (c) refinance the Class B 2014 Notes by redeeming in full the $35.0 million of Class B 2014\n\n\n \u2022 general price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets; \n (1) Excludes our subordinated note investments in SLF, which were redeemed on December 30, 2016. \nInvestment Income\n (1) Excludes our investments in SLF. \nThe following table summarizes portfolio composition and investment activity as of and for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n \u2022 fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, including costs associated with meeting financial sponsors; \nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future securities offerings and through our DRIP as well as future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our efforts to raise capital will be successful. In addition, we may, from time to time, amend or refinance our leverage facilities and securitization financings, to the extent permitted by applicable law. In addition to capital not being available, it also may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent we are not able to raise capital on what we believe are favorable terms, we will focus on optimizing returns by investing capital generated from repayments into new investments we believe are attractive from a risk/reward perspective. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we may receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors' allocation policy and have, in the past, received such smaller allocations under similar circumstances.\nAs of September 30, 2017, the 2010 Notes consisted of $205.0 million of Class A-Refi 2010 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.90%, $10.0 million of Class B-Refi 2010 Notes, which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.40%, and $135.0 million face amount of Subordinated 2010 Notes that did not bear interest. The Class A-Refi 2010 Notes are included in the September 30, 2017 Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as our debt and the Class B-Refi 2010 Notes and Subordinated 2010 Notes were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2017, we had outstanding debt under the 2010 Debt Securitization of $205.0 million. On July 20, 2018, the 2010 Notes were redeemed and, following such redemption, the agreements governing the 2010 Debt Securitization were terminated.\n\n \u2022 the ability of GC Advisors or its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; \nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Credit Facility allowed Funding to borrow up to $170.0 million and $225.0 million, respectively, at any one time outstanding, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had $136.0 million and $63.1 million outstanding under the Credit Facility, respectively. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, we had approximately $34.0 million and $161.9 million, respectively, of remaining commitments and $34.0 million and $95.0 million, respectively, of availability on the Credit Facility.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nInvestment income increased from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018 by $14.4 million primarily as a result of an increase in the average earning debt investments balance, which is the average balance of accruing loans in our investment portfolio, of $47.6 million, an increase in LIBOR and an increase in income from our investments in SLF attributable to increase in income from our investments in SLF. Investment income increased from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017 by $9.9 million primarily as a result of an increase in the average earning investment balance, which is the annual average balance of accruing loans in our investment portfolio, of $137.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decline in income from our investments in SLF of $4.5 million that was attributable to a decline in the credit performance of SLF's portfolio.\n \u2022 our future operating results; \nThe Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement for each of the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $2.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.0 million, respectively. However, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, we are required to include the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The capital gain incentive fee accrual which was calculated in accordance with GAAP as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $7.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively. Any payment due under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement is calculated in arrears at the end of each calendar year, and we paid a $1.2 million Capital Gain Incentive Fee calculated in accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement as of December 31, 2017. The Company did not pay any Capital Gain Incentive Fee calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement as of any date prior to December 31, 2017.\nThe following table shows the principal, amortized cost and fair value of our portfolio of investments by asset class:\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we had $1.9 million in unrealized depreciation on our investment in SLF LLC equity interests, which was primarily driven by net negative credit related adjustments associated with SLF's investment portfolio.\nValuation methods may include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, determination of the enterprise value of a portfolio company, discounted cash flow analysis and a market interest rate approach. The factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples; security covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company's ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows and the markets in which it does business; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and the principal market and enterprise values. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from values that may ultimately be received or settled.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. In this report, we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and Golub Capital BDC\u201d refer to Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n \n\n \u2022 costs associated with individual or group stockholders; \nTo the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any tax year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nFor any investment rated 1, 2 or 3, GC Advisors will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions.\nOn November 27, 2018, our board of directors recommended that we seek shareholder approval to reduce our asset coverage requirement to 150.0% at our annual meeting of stockholders currently scheduled for February 5, 2019. To the extent stockholder approval is received, we currently intend to target a GAAP debt-to-equity ratio of about 1.0x.\nOur internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments.\nUnder the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, the term \u2018\u2018collection period'' refers to a quarterly period commencing on the third business day prior to the preceding collection period to the and ending on (but excluding) the third business day prior to the payment date. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the total fees paid to GC Advisors for rendering these collateral management services, which are less than the management fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, will be offset against such management fee. In addition, the 2018 Issuer paid Morgan Stanley & Co.

The Staffing Agreement provides that Golub Capital LLC will make available to GC Advisors experienced investment professionals and provide access to the senior investment personnel of Golub Capital LLC for purposes of evaluating, negotiating, structuring, closing and monitoring our investments. The Staffing Agreement also includes a commitment that the members of GC Advisors' investment committee will serve in such capacity.

As of September 30, 2018, 98.6% and 98.6% of our debt portfolio at fair value and at amortized cost, respectively, had interest rate floors that limit the minimum applicable interest rates on such loans. As of September 30, 2017, 99.6% and 99.6% of our debt portfolio at fair value and at amortized cost, respectively, had interest rate floors that limit the minimum applicable interest rates on such loans.\n \u2022 the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments, excluding our investments in SLF, totaling $57.7 million and $60.5 million, respectively. These amounts may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers, subject to the terms of each loan's respective credit agreement. As of September 30, 2018, we believe that we had sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under our unfunded commitments based on historical rates of drawings upon unfunded commitments, cash and restricted cash balances that we maintain, availability under our Credit Facility, MS Credit Facility and Adviser Revolver, and ongoing principal repayments on debt investments. In addition, we generally hold some syndicated loans in larger portfolio companies that are saleable over a relatively short period to generate cash.\n\n\nOur board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\n \u2022 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; \nWe co-invest with RGA Reinsurance Company, or RGA, in senior secured loans through SLF, an unconsolidated Delaware LLC.

These amounts may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but we are showing this amount in the less than one year category as this entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of September 30, 2018, subject to the terms of each loan's respective credit agreement.  We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments, excluding our investments in SLF, totaling $57.7 million and $60.5 million, respectively. We had commitments of up to $99.6 million and $77.5 million to SLF as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively, which may be contributed primarily for the purpose of funding new investments approved by the SLF investment committee.\n (4) Proceeds from the LLC equity interests invested in SLF were utilized by SLF to invest in senior secured loans.  As of September 30, 2018 we had three debt investments on non-accrual status and non-accrual investments as a percentage of total investments at cost and fair value were 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. As of September 30, 2017, we had three debt investments on non-accrual status and non-accrual investments as a percentage of total investments at cost and fair value were 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively.

On October 20, 2016, we further amended the 2010 Debt Securitization to, among other things, (a) refinance the issued Class A 2010 Notes, by redeeming in full the $203.0 million Class A 2010 Notes and issuing new Class A-Refi 2010 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $205.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.90%, (b) refinance the Class B 2010 Notes by redeeming in full the $12.0 million Class B 2010 Notes and issuing new Class B-Refi 2010 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.40%, and (c) extend the reinvestment period applicable to the 2010 Issuer to July 20, 2018. Following the refinancing, Golub Capital BDC 2010-1 Holdings LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, or Holdings, retained the Class B-Refi 2010 Notes.\n\nOn November 16, 2018, we completed the 2018 Debt Securitization. The 2018 Notes were issued by the 2018 Issuer and are backed by a diversified portfolio of senior secured and second lien loans. The transaction was executed through a private placement of approximately $327.0 million of AAA/AAA Class A 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 1.48%; $61.2 million of AA Class B 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.10%; $20.0 million of A Class C-1 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.80%; $38.8 million of A Class C-2 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.65%; $42.0 million of BBB- Class D 2018 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.95%; and $113.4 million of Subordinated 2018 Notes which do not bear interest. We indirectly retained all of the Class C-2, Class D and Subordinated 2018 Notes. The 2018 Notes are scheduled to mature on January 20, 2031.\n \nPartial loan sales: We follow the guidance in ASC Topic 860, when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. Such guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a participating interest\u201d, as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales that do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain on our statements of assets and liabilities and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are carried at fair value.\n (2) Computed as the (a) annual stated interest rate on accruing senior secured loans divided by (b) total senior secured loans at principal amount. \nThe 2018 Notes are the secured obligations of the 2018 Issuer, and an indenture governing the 2018 Notes includes customary covenants and events of default.

Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\n (5) Loan was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2018, meaning that SLF has ceased recognizing interest income on the loan. \nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, which was most recently reapproved by our board of directors in May 2018, we have agreed to pay GC Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by an administrator, or the Administrator, which is currently Golub Capital LLC. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\n (6) Equity investment received as a result of the portfolio company's debt restructuring. \n \u2022 U.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees; \nSome of the statements in this annual report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition.

We have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with GC Advisors in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, GC Advisors provides us with investment advisory and management services.\nGC Advisors also sponsors or manages, and may in the future sponsor or manage, other investment funds, accounts or investment vehicles (together referred to as accounts\u201d) that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. For example, GC Advisors presently serves as the investment adviser to Golub Capital Investment Corporation and Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc., each an unlisted business development company that primarily focuses on investing in one stop and other senior secured loans. In addition, our officers and directors serve in similar capacities for Golub Capital Investment Corporation and Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. GC Advisors and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other accounts. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, and pursuant to GC Advisors' allocation policy, GC Advisors or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other accounts. We do not intend to make any investments if they are not permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, or if they are inconsistent with GC Advisors' allocation procedures.\n \u2022 the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position. \nInvestments and Related Investment Income: Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments. Premiums, discounts, and origination fees are amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment. For investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not likely to be collectible. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees and prepayment premiums on loans and record these fees as fee income when earned. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from LLC and limited partnership, or LP, investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of\nIn connection with the closing of the merger, it is our board of directors' intention to increase the dividend per quarter to $0.33 per share; provided that our board of directors' reserves the right to revisit this intention if market conditions or our prospects meaningfully change.\n (8) Equity investment received as a result of the portfolio company's debt restructuring. \nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, SLF had total assets at fair value of $186.3 million and $306.2 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2018, SLF had one portfolio company investment on non-accrual status with a fair value of $3.9 million. As of September 30, 2017, SLF had one portfolio company investment on non-accrual status with a fair value of $0.3 million. The portfolio companies in SLF are in industries and geographies similar to those in which we may invest directly. Additionally, as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, SLF had commitments to fund various undrawn revolving credit and delayed draw loans to its portfolio companies totaling $5.9 million and $13.3 million, respectively.\nLevel 3: Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities.

Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2016 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments and the reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation associated with the non-accrual portfolio company investments that were sold and written-off. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the amortization of discounts, negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value and the reversal of the net unrealized appreciation associated with the sales of portfolio company investments.\ncompany and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code.\nAmortization of debt issuance costs remained relatively stable from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018 as new debt issuance costs associated with the new or amended debt facilities were offset by the full amortization of previous costs incurred. Amortization of debt issuance costs declined from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017 as initial debt issuance costs associated with $125.0 million of SBIC IV debentures fully amortized.\nOur revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nThe following table summarizes our expenses for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\n \u2022 Golub Capital LLC provides, and other affiliates of Golub Capital have historically provided, us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our Administration Agreement. \nIn total, professional fees, the administrative service fee, and general and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018 and decreased by $0.2 million from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017. In general, we expect certain of our operating expenses, including professional fees, the administrative service fee, and other general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets during periods of growth and increase as a percentage of our total assets during periods of asset declines.\nMarket Environment: We believe that as part of the path of economic recovery following the credit crisis, there has been increased competition for new middle-market investments due to some new non-bank finance companies that have entered the market and due to improving financial performance of middle-market companies. However, we believe that our scale and strong market position will continue to allow us to find investment opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n \nExpenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, we may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA. A portfolio company's EBITDA may include pro-forma adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, we will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, we use a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses were $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for accrued expenses paid on behalf of us by the Administrator.\n \u2022 calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); \nDemand for Debt Capital. We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and subordinated debt from other sources, such as us.\nOur investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are currently allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. The Small Business Credit Availability Act, or SBCAA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to business development companies from 200% to 150% so long as the business development company meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a business development company to have a ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200% asset coverage requirement. Effectiveness of the reduced asset coverage requirement to a business development company requires approval by either (1) a required majority,\u201d as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act, of such business development company's board of directors with effectiveness one year after the date of such approval or (2) a majority of votes cast at a special or annual meeting of such business development company's stockholders at which a quorum is present, which is effective the day after such stockholder approval. On November 27, 2018, our board of directors recommended that we seek shareholder approval to reduce our asset coverage requirement to 150.0% at our annual meeting of stockholders currently scheduled for February 5, 2019. To the extent stockholder approval is received, we currently intend to target a GAAP debt-to-equity ratio of about 1.0x.\nOn March 21, 2017, we priced a public offering of 1,750,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $19.03 per share, raising approximately $33.3 million in gross proceeds. On March 24, 2017, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds, net of offering costs but before expenses, of $32.3 million were received. On April 6, 2017, we sold an additional 262,500 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of\n \n \u2022 transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses; \nWe account for investment transactions on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We report changes in fair value of investments from the prior period that is measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \u2022 U.S. federal, state and local taxes; \nWe have based the forward-looking statements included in this report on information available to us on the date of this report. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. This annual report on Form 10-K contains statistics and other data that have been obtained from or compiled from information made available by third-party service providers.

Net income can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, annual comparisons of net income may not be meaningful.\nBelow is certain summarized financial information for SLF as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017:\nWe follow ASC Topic 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the assets or liabilities or market and the assets' or liabilities' complexity. Our fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Assets and liabilities are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\n (10) The entire commitment was unfunded as of September 30, 2017. As such, no interest is being earned on this investment.  As of September 30, 2018, we have committed to fund $175.0 million of LLC equity interests to SLF. As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, $75.4 million and $97.5 million, respectively, of our LLC equity interest commitment to SLF had been called and contributed, net of return of capital distributions subject to recall. For the years ended September 30, 2018, and 2017, we received $8.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in dividend income from the SLF LLC equity interests.\n\n (7) Non-income producing securities. \nAs a result of the merger, we will be subject to certain additional risks, which will be set forth in the joint proxy statement/prospectus for the merger that we anticipate filing with the SEC in December 2018.\nWe believe that these administrative expenses approximate the amount of ongoing fees and expenses that we would be required to pay in connection with a traditional secured credit facility. Our common stockholders indirectly bear all of these expenses.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, we may base our valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. We generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment.\nOn August 15, 2016, we priced a public offering of 1,750,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.35 per share, raising approximately $32.1 million in gross proceeds. On August 19, 2016, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before expenses, of $31.1 million were received. On September 19, 2016, we sold an additional 136,970 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.35 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of the option granted in connection with the public offering in August 2016.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $16.9 million. During the period, cash used in operating activities was $8.6 million, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $646.6 million, partially offset by the proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $558.7 million and net investment income of $76.0 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $8.3 million, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $760.5 million that were partially offset by repayments of debt of $695.9 million and distributions paid of $71.1 million.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we had $2.0 million in unrealized appreciation on our investment in SLF LLC equity interests. Unrealized appreciation on the SLF LLC equity interests was primarily driven by increased net investment income at SLF.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had investments in 199 and 185 portfolio companies, respectively, with a total fair value of $1,711.8 million and $1,590.0 million, respectively, and had investments in SLF with a total fair value of $71.1 million and $95.0 million, respectively.\n (2) The total principal amount is presented for debt investments while the number of shares or units owned is presented for equity investments. \nInterest and other debt financing expenses increased by $4.7 million from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017 primarily due to the increase in the weighted average of outstanding borrowings from $826.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to $873.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 and an increase in the effective annual interest rate. The effective average interest rate on our outstanding debt increased to 3.6% for the year ended September 30, 2017 from 3.4% for the year ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the increase in LIBOR.\n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business. \nValuation of Investments\n \nThe following table shows the weighted average income yield and weighted average investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented nearly 100% of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value, and the total return based on the change in the quoted market price of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, in each case for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\n \u2022 proxy voting expenses; and \nAs of September 30, 2018, SLF is capitalized by LLC equity interest subscriptions from its members. On December 14, 2016, the SLF investment committee approved the recapitalization of the commitments of SLF's members. On December 30, 2016, SLF's members entered into additional LLC equity interest subscriptions totaling $160.0 million, SLF issued capital calls totaling $89.9 million to us and RGA and the subordinated notes previously issued by SLF were redeemed and terminated. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we and RGA owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the LLC equity interests. SLF's profits and losses are allocated to us and RGA in accordance with our respective ownership interests.\n \u2022 We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with GC Advisors. Mr. Lawrence Golub, our chairman, is a manager of GC Advisors, and Mr. David Golub, our chief executive officer, is a manager of GC Advisors, and each of Messrs. Lawrence Golub and David Golub owns an indirect pecuniary interest in GC Advisors. \nIncentive Fees\nCollateral management fees were paid directly by the 2010 Issuer and are paid by the 2014 Issuer to GC Advisors and are offset against the management fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In addition, the 2010 Issuer and 2014 Issuer paid Wells Fargo Securities, LLC structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the initial structuring and subsequent amendments to the 2010 Debt Securitization and the initial structuring of the 2014 Debt Securitization. Term debt securitizations are also known as collateralized loan obligations and are a form of secured financing incurred by us, which is consolidated by us and subject to our overall asset coverage requirement. The 2010 Issuer, the 2014 Issuer and 2018 Issuer also agreed to pay ongoing administrative expenses to the trustee, collateral manager, independent accountants, legal counsel, rating agencies and independent managers in connection with developing and maintaining reports, and providing required services in connection with the administration of the 2010 Debt Securitization, the 2014 Debt Securitization, and 2018 Debt Securitization, and collectively the Debt Securitizations, as applicable.\nBelow is a summary of SLF's portfolio, followed by a listing of the individual investments in SLF's portfolio as of September 30, 2018 and 2017:\n \u2022 our allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; \nOur investment activities are managed by GC Advisors and supervised by our board of directors of which a majority of the members are independent of us, GC Advisors and its affiliates.\nOverview\n * Represents an amount less than 0.1%. \nRevenue Recognition:\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment or derivative instrument, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized.

For the year ended September 30, 2016, we have excluded $0.5 million of secured borrowings, at fair value, which were the result of participations and partial loan sales that did not meet the definition of a participating interest\u201d, as defined in the guidance to Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 860 - Transfers and Servicing, or ASC Topic 860.  Interest Expense\n (5) The negative fair value is the result of the unfunded commitment being valued below par. \nOn November 27, 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.32 per share and a special distribution of $0.12 per share both of which are payable on December 28, 2018 to holders of record as of December 12, 2018.\n \u2022 actual and potential conflicts of interest with GC Advisors LLC, or GC Advisors, and other affiliates of Golub Capital LLC, collectively, Golub Capital; \n (1) 27 and 19 of our loans included a feature permitting a portion of the interest due on such loan to be PIK interest as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nAs of September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had debt and equity investments in 199, 185 and 183 portfolio companies, respectively, and an investment in SLF.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $27.0 million. During the period, cash provided by operating activities was $62.2 million, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $588.2 million, partially offset by the proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $588.2 million and net investment income of $69.5 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $89.2 million, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $545.0 million and net proceeds of an aggregate of $74.0 million from two equity offerings that were offset by repayments of debt of $628.6 million and distributions paid of $76.8 million.\nExcise Tax Expense\n \n \u2022 the impact on our business of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder and any actions toward repeal thereof; and \n\nAs part of the monitoring process, GC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. This system is not generally accepted in our industry or used by our competitors. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as GC Advisors' internal performance ratings:\nMarket Trends\nSeptember 30, 2017, with the exception of money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (Level 1 investments) and investments measured at fair value using the NAV, all investments were valued using Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year in an amount less than what would trigger payments of U.S. federal income tax under Subchapter M of the Code. We may then be required to incur a 4% excise tax on such income. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income may exceed estimated current year distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred a net expense of $0, $17,000 and $333,000, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax.\n\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under our valuation policy and process.\nInterest and other debt financing expenses increased by $1.6 million from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the increase in LIBOR which was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average of outstanding borrowings from $873.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 to $822.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in our debt was primarily driven by a decrease in the weighted average of outstanding borrowings on the Credit Facility from $138.8 million as of September 30, 2017 to $103.0 million as of September 30, 2018. The effective average interest rate on our outstanding debt\nDistributions\n (3) Represents the fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurement, or ASC Topic 820. The determination of such fair value is not included in our board of directors' valuation process described elsewhere herein. \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n (2) Represents income from interest, including subordinated notes in SLF, and fees, excluding amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us. \nThe subordinated notes issued by SLF and previously held by us were redeemed on December 30, 2016, and therefore no interest income was earned for the year ended September 30, 2018. For the year ended September 30, 2017, we earned interest income of $1.6 million on the subordinated notes.\ninvestments that meet the regulatory and investment guidelines established by the SBA for our SBICs, which are described in further detail in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, and for interest expense and fees on our outstanding SBA debentures.\n \u2022 general economic and political trends and other external factors; \nOn June 22, 2016, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with GC Advisors, or the Adviser Revolver, which permits us to borrow up to $20.0 million at any one time outstanding. We entered into the Adviser Revolver in order to have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis and have in the past repaid, and generally intend in the future to repay, borrowings under the Adviser Revolver within the same quarter in which they are drawn. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had no amounts outstanding on the Adviser Revolver.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle-market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies. We may also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in U.S. middle-market companies. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to U.S. middle-market companies with over $25.0 billion in capital under management as of September 30, 2018, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we had $6.3 million in net realized gains on investments, primarily due to the sale of, or capital gain distributions received from, several equity investments and the sale of debt investments to SLF that were partially offset by the realized loss on the sale of one non-accrual portfolio company investment and the write off of one non-accrual portfolio company investment.\nThe income yield by debt security type for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\n (1) For the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average income yield and weighted average investment income yield do not reflect interest income from subordinated notes in SLF, which were redeemed on December 30, 2016. \n (5) Total return based on market value assumes distributions are reinvested in accordance with the DRIP. Total return does not include sales load.  Revenues: We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, second lien or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are\n (1) For the year ended September 30, 2018, the investment in SLF represents the investment in LLC equity interests in SLF. For the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, the investments in SLF include our investments in both subordinated notes (prior to their redemption by SLF on December 30, 2016) and LLC equity interests in SLF. \n (4) We also hold a portion of the senior secured loan in this portfolio company. \nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe base management fee increased as a result of a sequential increase in average adjusted gross assets from 2016 to 2018.\nRecent Developments\nOn July 18, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a third party institutional investor for the sale of 1,433,486 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $17.44 per share. On July 21, 2016, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds of $25.0 million were received.\n\n \n \nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we receive under our Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nLevel 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n (2) We refer to a loan as non-accrual when we cease recognizing interest income on the loan because we have stopped pursuing repayment of the loan or, in certain circumstances, it is past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or our management has reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. See - Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition.\u201d \nOur shares are currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol GBDC\u201d.\nGC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the internal performance ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, GC Advisors and our board of directors review these internal performance ratings on a quarterly basis.\nWe intend to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders as determined by our board of directors. For additional details on distributions, see Dividends and distributions\u201d in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Administrator pays for certain expenses incurred by us. These expenses are subsequently reimbursed in cash. Total expenses reimbursed by us to the Administrator for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $2.4 million, $2.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nOn November 27, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to merge with GCIC with us as the surviving entity. Our board of directors and the board of directors of GCIC, including all of the respective independent directors, have approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein. Under the terms of the proposed merger, stockholders of GCIC will receive 0.865 shares of our stock for each share of GCIC, subject to adjustment only in the event of reclassification, recapitalization, or similar transaction by either company. The combined company will remain externally managed by GC Advisors and our officers and directors will remain in their current roles. The combined company will continue to trade under the ticker GBDC on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Consummation of the proposed merger is subject to our and GCIC stockholder approvals, customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Assuming satisfaction of these conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019.\nGC Advisors, will serve as collateral manager to the 2018 Issuer under a collateral management agreement and will receive a fee for providing these services in an amount equal to 0.25% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2018 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the total fees paid to GC Advisors for rendering collateral management services, which are less than the management fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, will be offset against such management fee.\nIn August 2018, our board of directors reapproved a share repurchase program, or the Program, which allows us to repurchase up to $75.0 million of our outstanding common stock on the open market at prices below the NAV per share as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements. The Program may be implemented at the discretion of management. The shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market transactions, including block transactions. We did not make any repurchases of our common stock during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following:\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities\n \u2022 costs associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; \n \u2022 During the first nine months of the calendar year 2018, the Golub Capital Employee Grant Program Rabbi Trust, or the Trust, purchased approximately $7.2 million of shares, or 396,099 shares, of our common stock for the purpose of awarding incentive compensation to employees of Golub Capital. During calendar year 2017, the Trust purchased approximately $17.7 million of shares, or 955,896 shares, of our common stock, for the purpose of awarding incentive compensation to employees of Golub Capital. \nOur quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of GC Advisors responsible for credit monitoring. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and GC Advisors. The audit committee of our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations. At least once annually the valuation for each portfolio investment, subject to a de minimis threshold, is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith.\n \u2022 the effect of investments that we expect to make and the competition for those investments; \nIncome taxes: See Consolidated Results of Operations - Expenses - Excise Tax Expense.\u201d\n (1) SLF's proceeds from the subordinated notes were utilized by SLF to invest in senior secured loans. SLF redeemed the outstanding balance on the subordinated notes on December 30, 2016.  Income yields on one stop and senior secured loans increased for the year ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the rise in LIBOR. As of September 30, 2018, we have one second lien investment and two subordinated debt investments as shown in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. Due to the limited number of second lien and subordinated debt investments, annual income yields on second lien and subordinated debt investments can be significantly impacted by the addition, subtraction or refinancing of one investment.\n \nSenior Loan Fund LLC\n (6) The entire commitment was unfunded as of September 30, 2017. As such, no interest is being earned on this investment. \n (1) SLF's proceeds from the subordinated notes and LLC equity interests were utilized by SLF to invest in senior secured loans. As of September 30, 2018, SLF had investments in senior secured loans to 32 different borrowers.  For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately $495.5 million, $449.8 million and $366.2 million, excluding $78.7 million of proceeds from the repayment in full and termination of our investment in subordinated notes of SLF during the year ended 2017, respectively, in proceeds from principal payments and return of capital distributions of portfolio companies. For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had sales of investments in 21, 72 and 44 portfolio companies, respectively, aggregating approximately $37.6 million, $138.4 million and $172.2 million, respectively, in net proceeds.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we had $28.0 million in unrealized appreciation on 186 portfolio company investments, which was partially offset by $26.6 million in unrealized depreciation on 192 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2017 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments and the reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation associated with the non-accrual portfolio company investments that were sold and written-off. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the amortization of discounts, negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value and the reversal of the net unrealized appreciation associated with the sales of portfolio company investments.\nThe Class A-1-R, Class A-2-R and Class B-R 2014 Notes are included in the September 30, 2018 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as our debt and the Class C-R 2014 Notes and LLC equity interests in the 2014 Issuer were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2018, we had outstanding debt under the 2014 Debt Securitization of $197.5 million. The Class A-1, Class A-2 and Class B 2014 Notes are included in the September 30, 2017 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as our debt and the Class C 2014 Notes and LLC equity interests in the 2014 Issuer were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2017, we had outstanding debt under the 2014 Debt Securitization of $246.0 million.\n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; \nThe following table shows the asset mix of our new investment commitments for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n (1) Proceeds from the LLC equity interests invested in SLF were utilized by SLF to invest in senior secured loans.  One stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as late stage lending loans. Other targeted characteristics of late stage lending businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower's high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we may adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, one stop loans included $169.4 million and $138.6 million, respectively, of late stage lending loans at fair value.\n (2) As of September 30, 2016, the investment in SLF includes our investments in both subordinated notes and LLC equity interests in SLF. \nUnder the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us with clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administrator also provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.\n \nFor the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we earned a total return on our weighted average capital invested in SLF of 6.6% and 7.8%, respectively. The annualized total return on weighted average capital invested is\nexplore expanding our secured debt financing facilities or entering into new secured debt financings, including term\n (4) We also hold a portion of the senior secured loan in this portfolio company. \nCompetition from Bank Lenders. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We believe these factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore more market opportunities for us.\n\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, the portfolio median earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for our portfolio companies (excluding SLF) was $26.2 million and $25.2 million, respectively. The portfolio median EBITDA is based on the most recently reported trailing twelve-month EBITDA received from the portfolio company.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\n (3) The negative fair value is the result of the unfunded commitment being valued below par. \nWe have identified the following trends that may affect our business:\n \nOn November 1, 2018, the 2018 Issuer entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Golub Capital BDC CLO III Depositor LLC, as depositor, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as the initial purchaser, or the Initial Purchaser, pursuant to which the 2018 Issuer agreed to sell the 2018 Notes to the Initial Purchaser as part of the 2018 Debt Securitization. Term debt securitizations are also known as CLOs and are a form of secured financing incurred by the Company, which are consolidated by the Company and subject to its overall asset coverage requirement.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we had $25.1 million in unrealized appreciation on 158 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $34.8 million in unrealized depreciation on 169 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2018 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the reversal of the net unrealized appreciation associated with the sales of portfolio company investments, the amortization of discounts, and negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value.\nFair value of our debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using comparable market rates or market quotes for similar instruments at the measurement date, if available.\n \u2022 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we invest; \n (4) Total return based on average net asset value is calculated as (a) the net increase in net assets resulting from operations divided by (b) the daily average of total net assets. Total return does not include sales load. \nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively. In addition, we had foreign currencies of $0.2 million as of September 30, 2018 and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $39.7 million and $58.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents are available to fund new investments, pay operating expenses and pay distributions. As of September 30, 2018, $14.7 million of our restricted cash and cash equivalents will be used for the payment of principal and interest expense on the notes issued in the 2014 Debt Securitization, which is described in further detail in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2018, $5.8 million of our restricted cash and cash equivalents could be used to fund investments that meet the guidelines under the Credit Facility as well as for the payment of interest expense and revolving debt of the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2018, $8.1 million of our restricted cash and cash equivalents could be used to fund investments that meet the guidelines under the MS Credit Facility as well as for the payment of interest expense and revolving debt of the MS Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2018, $11.1 million of our restricted cash and cash equivalents could be used to fund new\n\n (1) At principal amount. \nManagement Fee\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes.\n * Represents an amount less than 0.1%. \n \u2022 We have entered into a license agreement with Golub Capital LLC, pursuant to which Golub Capital LLC has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Golub Capital.\u201d \n \u2022 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; \n \u2022 our ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a regulated investment company, or RIC,  and as a business development company;\nAdvisors sold to the 2018 Issuer all of its ownership interest in such portfolio loans for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement. Under the terms of the other loan sale agreement governing the 2018 Debt Securitization Depositor Loan Sale Agreement, which provides for the sale of assets on the Closing Date as well as future sales from us to the 2018 Issuer through CLO Depositor, (3) we sold and/or contributed to the CLO Depositor the remainder of its ownership interest in the portfolio company investments securing the 2018 Debt Securitization and participations for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the Depositor Loan Sale Agreement and (4) CLO Depositor, in turn, sold to the 2018 Issuer all of its ownership interest in such portfolio loans and participations for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in one of the loan sale agreements. Following these transfers, the 2018 Issuer, and neither GC Advisors, the CLO Depositor nor us, held all of the ownership interest in such portfolio company investments and participations. We made customary representations, warranties and covenants in these loan sale agreements.\n (3) Represents income from interest, including subordinated notes in SLF, fees and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us. \nOn September 13, 2011, we received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing us to modify the asset coverage requirement to exclude the SBA debentures from our asset coverage calculation. As such, our ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 200% even if we do not approve the modified asset coverage requirement permitted by Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. This provides us with increased investment flexibility but also increases our risks related to leverage. As of September 30, 2018, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 269.5% (excluding the SBA debentures).\n\n \nSuch forward-looking statements may include statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words may,\u201d might,\u201d will,\u201d intend,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d can,\u201d would,\u201d expect,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d anticipate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d plan\u201d or similar words.

During the period, cash used in operating activities was $56.1 million, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $654.8 million, partially offset by the proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $538.6 million and net investment income of $65.0 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $48.1 million, primarily due to net proceeds of an aggregate $58.6 million from one equity offering and one private placement and net borrowings on debt of $51.5 million, partially offset by distributions paid of $59.5 million.\n$19.03 per share pursuant to the underwriter's exercise of the option granted in connection with the March 2017 offering. On June 6, 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell 1,750,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to an underwritten, public offering at a price to us of $18.71 per share. On June 12, 2017, the transaction closed, the shares were issued and proceeds, net of offering costs but before expenses, of $32.7 million were received. On July 5, 2017, we sold an additional 220,221 shares of our common stock pursuant to the underwriter's partial exercise of the option we granted in connection with the sale of shares in June 2017.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017 we had a net realized gain on investments of $9.4 million primarily due to net realized gains on the sale of equity securities in 18 portfolio company investments and net gains on the sale of debt investments to SLF, which was partially offset by a net realized loss on the sale of a debt and equity investment in a single portfolio company.\nPrior to their termination, SLF elected to fair value the subordinated notes issued to us and RGA under ASC Topic 825 - Financial Instruments, or ASC Topic 825. As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, SLF had no subordinated notes outstanding.\nWe entered into two loan sale agreements which govern the 2018 Debt Securitization. Under the terms of the loan sale agreement entered into upon the Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement, which provides for the sale of assets on the Closing Date to satisfy risk retention requirements, (1) we transferred to GC Advisors a portion of our ownership interest in the portfolio company investments securing the 2018 Debt Securitization for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement and (2) immediately thereafter, GC\nConsolidated operating results for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\n \n (8) The entire commitment was unfunded as of September 30, 2018. As such, no interest is being earned on this investment. \nGC Advisors, as collateral manager for the 2014 Issuer, our wholly-owned subsidiary, under a collateral management agreement, or the 2014 Collateral Management Agreement, is entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.25% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2014 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2014 Collateral Management Agreement, the term \u2018\u2018collection period'' refers to a quarterly period running from the day after the end of the prior collection period to the tenth business day prior to the payment date.\nOn November 1, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the documents governing the MS Credit Facility. The MS Credit Facility amendment increased the borrowing capacity under the MS Credit Facility from $300.0 million to $450.0 million. The other material terms of the MS Credit Facility were unchanged.\nWe generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which may be referred to as junk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.\nA portion of the proceeds of the private placement of the 2018 Notes, net of expenses, was used to repay all amounts outstanding under the MS Credit Facility, following which the agreements governing the MS Credit Facility were terminated.\n (9) Non-income producing. \n \u2022 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; \ncapitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see Critical Accounting Policies-Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nTarget Market. We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Golub Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the MS Credit Facility allowed 2010 Issuer to borrow up to $300.0 million at any one time outstanding, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. As of September 30, 2018, we had $234.7 million outstanding under the MS Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2018, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, we had approximately $65.3 million of remaining commitments and $6.7 million of availability on the MS Credit Facility.\n\n \nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with approximately 25% (based on the number of portfolio companies) of our valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm. As of September 30, 2018 and\nFair Value Measurements\n \u2022 all costs of registration and listing our shares on any securities exchange; \nPrior to the redemption of the 2010 Notes and termination of the documents governing the 2010 Debt Securitization on July 20, 2018, GC Advisors served as collateral manager for the 2010 Issuer, under a collateral management agreement, or the 2010 Collateral Management Agreement, and was entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.35% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2010 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which was payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2010 Collateral Management Agreement, the term \u2018\u2018collection period'' referred to a quarterly period running from the day after the end of the prior collection period to the fifth business day of the calendar month in which a payment date occurs. Following the redemption of the 2010 Notes on July 20, 2018, the 2010 Collateral Management Agreement was terminated.\nNon-accrual: Loans may be left on accrual status during the period we are pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on non-accrual status. We generally reverse accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment. We restore non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in our management's judgment, are likely to remain current. The total fair value of our non-accrual loans was $5.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and $3.0 million as of September 30, 2017.\n \u2022 the adequacy of our financing sources and working capital; \n\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we had $3.6 million in unrealized depreciation on our investments in SLF LLC equity interests. Unrealized depreciation on the SLF LLC equity interests was driven by negative credit related adjustments associated with SLF's investment portfolio that was primarily driven by one portfolio company investment taken to non-accrual status.\n\n \n \u2022 administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs); \nThe accrual for capital gain incentive fee under GAAP was $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2018, $2.8 million, or $0.05 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2017, and $1.2 million, or $0.03 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in accruals for a capital gain incentive fee under GAAP for the year ended September 30, 2018 from the year ended September 30, 2017 was primarily the result of unrealized depreciation of debt and equity investments. The increase in accruals for a capital gain incentive fee under GAAP for the year ended September 30, 2017 from the year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the\nNotes and issuing new Class B-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, (d) refinance the Class C 2014 Notes by redeeming in full the $37.5 million of Class C 2014 Notes and issuing new Class C-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $37.5 million that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.55%. The Class C-R 2014 Notes were retained by us, and we remain the sole owner of the equity of the 2014 Issuer.\n (3) Represents income from interest, including subordinated notes in SLF, and fees, excluding amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning debt investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us. \n (1) Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in SLF includes our investment in subordinated notes and LLC equity interests in SLF.  For the year ended September 30, 2018, we had a net realized gain on investments and foreign currency transactions of $17.5 million primarily due to realized gains on the sale of equity securities in more than 20 portfolio company investments, partially offset by the realized loss on the sale or disposition of three under-performing debt investments.\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 internal performance rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2018 and 2017:\nThe incentive fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement consists of two parts: (1) the Income Incentive Fee and (2) the Capital Gain Incentive Fee. The Income Incentive Fee increased by $6.9 million from the year ended September 30, 2017 to the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily as a result of the increase in net investment income. As the Company remains in the \"catch-up\" provision of the Income Incentive Fee calculation, the increase in net investment income causes a corresponding increase in the Income Incentive Fee until the Company is fully through the \"catch-up\" provision. The Income Incentive Fee decreased by $1.3 million from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2017 as the interest rate compression on new investments and the decline of second lien and subordinated debt investments in our portfolio caused a decline in our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets. For the year ended September 30, 2018, while still not fully through the \"catch-up\" provision in any quarter of the Income Incentive Fee calculation, the Income Incentive Fee as a percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income increased to 18.7% compared to 6.1% for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 8.3% for the year ended September 30, 2016.", "item_7_tables": "Table 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>7.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop\n</td> <td>8.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien\n</td> <td>10.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>15.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes in SLF(1)\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SLF Investment Portfolio as of September 30, 2018 - (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Business Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment\nType\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current\nInterest\nRate(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal ($) /\nShares(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\nValue(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RSC Acquisition, Inc.(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11/2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RSC Acquisition, Inc.(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11/2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rubio's Restaurants, Inc.(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beverage, Food and Tobacco\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10/2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rug Doctor LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Personal and Non Durable Consumer Products (Mfg.

2017 to $152.2 million in 2018, primarily due to higher interest income from a larger investment portfolio and higher LIBOR rates. Net investment income also increased from $69.5 million to $76.0 million. \n\n- Net realized gains on investments increased from $9.4 million in 2017 to $17.5 million in 2018, mainly due to gains on the sale of equity investments. However, net unrealized appreciation declined from $3.3 million to a $11.6 million loss, primarily due to depreciation on investments. \n\n- Total expenses increased from $68.2 million in 2017 to $76.2 million in 2018, largely driven by higher incentive fees, interest expense and management fees.\n\n- As of Sept 30, 2018, the investment portfolio was $1.71 billion across 199 companies, compared to $1.59 billion across 185 companies a year earlier. The portfolio remains heavily weighted towards one stop loans.\n\n- The company completed a $327 million debt securitization in November 2018 to raise capital and retired some higher cost debt. The company may also seek shareholder approval to increase leverage.\n\n- The company pays quarterly distributions to shareholders and may increase the dividend per share if the proposed merger with GCIC is completed.\n\nIn summary, the company grew its investment portfolio and revenues in 2018 but also took on more leverage. The proposed GCIC merger aims to increase scale. The company remains focused on middle-market lending in the U.S."}
