MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nGeneral\nThis discussion and analysis reflects the Company's consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements, which appear beginning on page.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, investment securities, mortgage-backed securities and other interest-earning assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents), and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of money market accounts, statement savings accounts, individual retirement accounts and certificates of deposit. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of fees, service charges, and gains on the sale of loans. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits, deposit insurance premiums, directors' fees, occupancy, data processing and professional fees. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. We consider the allowance for loan losses to be our critical accounting policy.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an amount necessary to absorb known or inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect each borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nThe Company's total assets increased $25.2 million, or 11.0%, to $255.4 million at December 31, 2017, from $230.2 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $46.4 million in the net loan portfolio, offset by decreases in securities available for sale of $18.5 million and decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 million.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $2.2 million, or 36.8%, to $3.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $5.9 million at December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of cash used in investing activities of $28.6 million exceeding cash provided by financing activities of $23.5 million and cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 million. The cash used in investing activities includes the purchase of approximately $14.1 million in auto loans and other net loan increases of $33.5 million, purchases of available for sale securities of $1.3 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $0.2 million, partially offset by sales, calls, maturities and paydowns of available for sale securities of $19.4 million and a decrease in federal funds sold of $0.8 million. The net cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $16.0 million and increases in deposits of $10.2 million, partially offset by a principal reduction in Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $2.0 million, shares repurchased and cancelled of $0.3 million and dividends paid of $0.5 million.\nFederal funds sold decreased approximately $0.8 million, or 44.4%, to $0.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $1.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nSecurities available for sale decreased $18.5 million, or 41.6%, to $26.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $44.6 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to sales, calls and maturities of $14.5 million and pay-downs of $4.9 million, offset by $1.3 million in purchases. The remaining decreases were attributable to net amortization/accretion of premiums and discounts, changes in unrealized gains/losses, and gains/losses on sales.\nLoans, net of the allowance for loan losses, increased $46.4 million, or 28.9%, to $207.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $160.6 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, was primarily due to an increase in gross consumer direct and purchased auto loans of $12.3 million, an increase in gross residential mortgage loans of $20.7 million, an increase in gross non-residential real estate loans of $9.6 million and an increase in gross commercial loans of $4.1 million, offset by an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $0.2 million. The changes above are net of normal pay-downs and principal reductions.\nTotal deposits increased $10.2 million, or 5.9%, to $182.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $172.5 million at December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to an increase in certificates of deposit of $7.4 million, or 9.1%, an increase in savings account balances of $2.0 million, or 8.2%, and an increase in checking balances of $3.0 million, or 8.1%, partially offset by a decrease in money market balances of $2.2 million, or 7.3% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The increase in certificates of deposit is primarily due to listing service deposits of $5.2 million, while the remaining increase in certificates of deposit and the increase in savings and checking balances is due to management's continued efforts to strategically price interest rates to position the Bank for rising interest rates and customers seeking non-term products as they wait for a better rate environment.\nFHLB advances increased $14.0 million, to $15.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2016, to fund the loan growth experienced during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nStockholders' equity decreased approximately $35,000, but remained constant at $51.9 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease reflects net income of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and an increase in other comprehensive income of $0.1 million related to an increase in the fair value of securities available for sale, partially offset by dividends of $0.5 million paid to shareholders, $0.3 million to re-purchase and cancel outstanding shares of common stock and an approximately $0.2 million net decrease related to allocation of ESOP shares.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $0.4 million, or 35.5%, to $0.8 million compared to net income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributed to an increase in income tax expense of $0.9 million, of which approximately $0.8 million resulted from the re-valuation of the Company's net deferred tax assets due to the December 22, 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and an increase in total other expenses of $0.9 million. The increases in expenses were partially offset by increases in net interest income after provision for loan losses of $0.9 million and a $0.5 million increase in total other income.\nNet Interest Income. The following table summarizes interest and dividend income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and dividend income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and fees on loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.01 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage-backed and related securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(110 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.15 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State and municipal securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.15 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-marketable equity securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.09 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.67 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest and dividend income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.44 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127.78 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.08 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.51 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest income increased by $1.0 million, or 13.5%, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest and dividend income increased $1.2 million, or 14.4%, primarily due to an increase in the average balances of interest-earning assets of $16.4 million. The increase in net interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as the average cost of funds increased 11 basis points to 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net interest margin increased 5.2% during the year ended December 31, 2017 to 3.84% from 3.65%.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Management recorded a provision for loan losses of $0.6 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in provision expense was primarily due to increases in the loan portfolio, and therefore the need to increase the provision for loan losses. Additionally, net charge-offs were approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan losses was $2.5 million, or 1.18% of total gross loans at December 31, 2017 compared to $2.2 million, or 1.38% of gross loans at December 31, 2016. General reserves were higher at December 31, 2017, when compared to December 31, 2016, as the balances in all loan categories increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. These increases to the allowance were partially offset by improvements in historical loss levels and changes in qualitative factors during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. Additionally, specific reserves as of December 31, 2017 were lower than they were as of December 31, 2016, due to several credits being resolved during 2017 that had reserves as of December 31, 2016. Management's assessment of risk in the portfolio is reflected in the qualitative factors, as discussed on pages 11 and 12. Based on a review of the loans that were in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, management believes that the allowance is maintained at a level that represents its best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio that were both probable and reasonably estimable.\nManagement uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors. As a result, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect the Company's operating results. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nOther Income. The following table summarizes other income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,125.00 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of loans, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.94 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of foreclosed real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(143 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(76.06 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of repossessed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan origination and servicing income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Origination of mortgage servicing rights, net of amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.09 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer service fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.05 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash surrender value of life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.00 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.37 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in total other income was primarily due to higher revenues related to mortgage banking activity, as gain on sale of loans, loan origination and servicing income increased, an increase in the gain on sale of securities, offset by a decrease in gains on sales of foreclosed real estate. The higher revenues related to mortgage banking activity was a result of increases in originations and sales during 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in the gains on sale of securities was due to an increase in the amount of securities sold during 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease in the gain on sale of foreclosed real estate is primarily due to the sale of fewer properties during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nOther Expenses.

Loan expense increased due to the increase in loan originations during 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in the loss on sale of securities was due to an increase in the amount of securities sold during 2017 as compared to 2016. The efficiency ratio decreased due to increased net interest income and other income for the current period.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $0.9 million increase in income tax expense includes approximately $0.8 million from the re-valuation of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and approximately $0.1 million resulting from the increase in net income before taxes of approximately $0.5 million.\nAverage Balance Sheet\nThe following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates. No tax equivalent adjustments were made. All average balances are monthly average balances. Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The amortization of loan fees is included in computing interest income; however, such fees are not material.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>

The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of residential mortgage loans, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has established an Asset/Liability Management Committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the Asset/Liability Management Committee, which consists of senior management operating under a policy adopted by the Board of Directors, meets as needed to review our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position.\nWe have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to limit the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. In an attempt to accomplish this, we offer a variety of loan products, some of which are based on the prime rate and some loan products that adjust on one- to-five year intervals, based on various indices including the prime rate and U.S. Treasury securities. To shorten asset duration, we purchase investments, which are usually three to five years in length, as well as balance our investment purchases to ensure extension risk is minimized. In addition, we have attempted to lengthen the maturities of our deposit accounts by offering proportionately higher interest rates for longer terms, 3-5 year certificate accounts and by increasing our core deposits, in which the overall balances are generally less volatile to interest rate fluctuations than certificate accounts.\nFor additional information on our risk management strategy, see the sections entitled, Item 1. Business - Delinquent Loans,\u201d Item 1. Business - Nonperforming Assets,\u201d Item 1. Business Ratios,\u201d and Item 1. Business - Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nNet Portfolio Value. The net present value of an institution's cash flow from assets, liabilities and off balance sheet items (the institution's net portfolio value or NPV\u201d) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. For periods subsequent to December 31, 2011, institutions are responsible for valuing their own portfolios, or arranging to obtain the required information from a third-party provider. The model utilized by the Company's third-party provider utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumption that the United States Treasury yield curve increases by 100 to 300 basis points, or decreases by 100 basis points instantaneously. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates\u201d column below.\nThe tables below set forth, as of the periods indicated, net portfolio value, the estimated changes in our net portfolio value that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.\nTable 85:

portfolio value. In the event of a 200-basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a decrease of approximately 7.6% in net portfolio value. For a 300-basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a decreased value of approximately 13.5% in net portfolio value. In the event of a 100-basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience an increase of approximately 1.6% in net portfolio value.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net portfolio value table presented assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or re-pricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net portfolio value table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe maintain liquid assets at levels we believe are adequate to meet our liquidity needs. Our liquidity ratio averaged 3.11% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 6.80% for the year ended December 31, 2016. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives.\nOur liquidity ratio cannot be calculated using amounts disclosed in our consolidated financial statements, as many of the calculations involve monthly, quarterly, or annual averages. To calculate our liquidity ratio, the average liquidity base from the prior month is used as the denominator to calculate a daily liquidity ratio. The liquidity base consists of savings account balances, certificate of deposit balances, checking and money market balances, deposit loans and borrowings. The daily balances of these components are averaged to arrive at the liquidity base for the month, and the daily cash balances in selected general ledger accounts are used to derive our liquidity position. A daily liquidity ratio is calculated using the liquidity for the day divided by the prior month's average liquidity base. At the end of each month, a monthly liquidity position is calculated using the average liquidity position for the month divided by the prior month's average liquidity base. To calculate quarterly and annual liquidity ratios, we take the average liquidity for the three- or twelve-month period, respectively, and average it.\nWe maintain a liquidity ratio policy that establishes a target range of 1% to 5% for the liquidity ratio to assist in the management of this metric. However, during the existing low interest rate environment, we have strategically allowed this metric to at times be above 5% to provide for the effective management of extension risk and other interest rate risks.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities, other short-term investments, earnings, and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements.\nOur cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included with the Consolidated Financial Statements which begin on page of this Form 10-K.\nOur primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one-to-four family, non-residential and multi-family real estate and other loans, including loans originated for sale, and the purchase of investment securities. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our loan originations totaled $89.0 million and $56.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, we purchased loans totaling $19.6 million, compared to the purchase of loans totaling $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we received $22.5 million and $18.8 million, respectively, from the sale of loans, resulting in gains of $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Cash received from the sales, calls, maturities and pay-downs on securities totaled $19.4 million and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. We purchased $1.3 million and $7.2 million in securities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For a more detailed breakdown of our loan activity, see the section entitled Item 1. Business-Loan Origination, Purchase and Sales.\u201d\nDeposit flows are generally affected by the level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by local competitors, and other factors. Deposits increased $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and decreased $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For a more detailed breakdown of our deposit activity, see the section entitled Item 1. Business-Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds.\u201d\nLiquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago ( FHLBC\u201d) to provide advances and with Bankers Bank of Wisconsin to purchase Federal Funds. As a member of the FHLBC, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met. We had an available borrowing limit of $60.4 million and $65.3 million from the FHLBC as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bank had $7.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively of available credit from Bankers Bank of Wisconsin to purchase Federal Funds. There were $15.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively of Federal Home Loan Bank advances at December 31, 2017 and 2016 and no Federal Funds purchased outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $3.2 million, unfunded commitments under lines of credit of $16.7 million, unfunded commitments on construction loans of $5.6 million, and no unfunded standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2017, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled $40.8 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us, we will have to utilize other funding sources, such as FHLBC advances, in order to maintain our level of assets. Alternatively, we could reduce our level of liquid assets, such as our cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher at the time of renewal.\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from Ottawa Savings Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders, and interest and principal on outstanding debt, if any. The Company's primary source of income is dividends received from Ottawa Savings Bank. The amount of dividends that Ottawa Savings Bank may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year, without the receipt of prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board, but with prior notice to the Federal Reserve Board, cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income (as defined) for the preceding two calendar years. At December 31, 2017, the Company had liquid assets of $9.3 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash-flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract and will also require additional disclosures. The new authoritative guidance was originally effective for reporting periods after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) was issued to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB issued four subsequent ASUs in 2016 which are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance related to ASU 2014-09. The Company's revenue is comprised of net interest income, which is explicitly excluded from the scope of ASU 2014-09, and non-interest income. The Company has completed its overall assessment of non-interest income and review of related contracts potentially affected by the guidance. The Company's assessment indicates the adoption of this guidance will not materially change the method in which non-interest income is recognized. In addition, the Company is evaluating the expanded disclosure requirement. The Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2018 and a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was not necessary.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The adoption of the new financial instruments standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance in this ASU, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee`s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new lease guidance also simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that this standard will have on its financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU simplifies the treatment and accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU 2016-09 became effective for us on January 1, 2017 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that in the future the adoption of this update may result in a marginal amount of volatility within income tax expense, depending on the amount and timing of share-based compensation award activity such as the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, as well as the exercise of stock options.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization's portfolio. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. ASU 2016-13 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU simplifies measurement of goodwill and eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The Company should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. The impairment charge is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20), Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which shortens the period of amortization of the premium on certain callable debt securities to the earliest call date. Currently, generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) excludes certain callable debt securities from consideration of early repayment of principal even if the holder is certain that the call will be exercised. As a result, upon the exercise of a call on a callable debt security held at a premium, the unamortized premium is recorded as a loss in earnings. ASU 2017-08 requires that premiums on certain callable debt securities be amortized to the shortest call date. Securities within the scope of this ASU are those that have explicit, noncontingent call features that are callable at fixed prices and on preset dates. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The impact of adopting this ASU is dependent on the materiality of callable debt securities at the time of adoption.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this update allow for a reclassification of stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and the Company elected to early adopt this guidance effective December 31, 2017. The adoption of this standard resulted in a reclassification of stranded tax effects of $25,108 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.", "item_7_truncated": "Average Balance Sheet\nThe table above indicates that at December 31, 2017, in the event of a 100-basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a decrease of approximately 2.9% in net portfolio value. In the event of a 200-basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a decrease of approximately 7.6% in net portfolio value. For a 300-basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a decreased value of approximately 13.5% in net portfolio value. In the event of a 100-basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience an increase of approximately 1.6% in net portfolio value.\nLoans, net of the allowance for loan losses, increased $46.4 million, or 28.9%, to $207.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $160.6 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, was primarily due to an increase in gross consumer direct and purchased auto loans of $12.3 million, an increase in gross residential mortgage loans of $20.7 million, an increase in gross non-residential real estate loans of $9.6 million and an increase in gross commercial loans of $4.1 million, offset by an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $0.2 million. The changes above are net of normal pay-downs and principal reductions.\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,125.00 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of loans, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.94 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of foreclosed real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(143 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(76.06 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of repossessed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan origination and servicing income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Origination of mortgage servicing rights, net of amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.09 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer service fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.05 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash surrender value of life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.00 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.37 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Portfolio Value. The net present value of an institution's cash flow from assets, liabilities and off balance sheet items (the institution's net portfolio value or NPV\u201d) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. For periods subsequent to December 31, 2011, institutions are responsible for valuing their own portfolios, or arranging to obtain the required information from a third-party provider. The model utilized by the Company's third-party provider utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumption that the United States Treasury yield curve increases by 100 to 300 basis points, or decreases by 100 basis points instantaneously. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates\u201d column below.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Portfolio Value As A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Portfolio Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage Of Present Value Assets\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change In\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent Of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> NPV\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change In\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Basis Points)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> NPV\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Of Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Basis Points\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars In Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,677 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-9.43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,801 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-5.65 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,017 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-2.05 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,057 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-2.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net portfolio value table presented assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or re-pricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net portfolio value table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nManagement uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors. As a result, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect the Company's operating results. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Portfolio Value As A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Portfolio Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage Of Present Value Assets\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change In\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent Of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> NPV\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change In\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Basis Points)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> NPV\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Of Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Basis Points\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars In Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,504 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-13.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(163 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,798 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-7.63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(78 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,815 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-2.89 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.07 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization's portfolio. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. ASU 2016-13 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this update allow for a reclassification of stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and the Company elected to early adopt this guidance effective December 31, 2017. The adoption of this standard resulted in a reclassification of stranded tax effects of $25,108 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.\nWe maintain liquid assets at levels we believe are adequate to meet our liquidity needs. Our liquidity ratio averaged 3.11% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 6.80% for the year ended December 31, 2016. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and dividend income:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and fees on loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.01 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage-backed and related securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(110 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.15 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State and municipal securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.15 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-marketable equity securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.09 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.67 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest and dividend income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.44 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127.78 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.08 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.51 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecurities available for sale decreased $18.5 million, or 41.6%, to $26.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $44.6 million at December 31, 2016.

indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates.

The amortization of loan fees is included in computing interest income; however, such fees are not material.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract and will also require additional disclosures. The new authoritative guidance was originally effective for reporting periods after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) was issued to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB issued four subsequent ASUs in 2016 which are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance related to ASU 2014-09. The Company's revenue is comprised of net interest income, which is explicitly excluded from the scope of ASU 2014-09, and non-interest income. The Company has completed its overall assessment of non-interest income and review of related contracts potentially affected by the guidance. The Company's assessment indicates the adoption of this guidance will not materially change the method in which non-interest income is recognized. In addition, the Company is evaluating the expanded disclosure requirement. The Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2018 and a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was not necessary.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company's total assets increased $25.2 million, or 11.0%, to $255.4 million at December 31, 2017, from $230.2 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $46.4 million in the net loan portfolio, offset by decreases in securities available for sale of $18.5 million and decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 million.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities, other short-term investments, earnings, and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements.\nWe consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. We consider the allowance for loan losses to be our critical accounting policy.\nOther Expenses. The following table summarizes other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n\n (1) Computed as other expenses divided by the sum of net interest income and other income. \nFor additional information on our risk management strategy, see the sections entitled, Item 1. Business - Delinquent Loans,\u201d Item 1. Business - Nonperforming Assets,\u201d Item 1. Business Ratios,\u201d and Item 1. Business - Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20), Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which shortens the period of amortization of the premium on certain callable debt securities to the earliest call date. Currently, generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) excludes certain callable debt securities from consideration of early repayment of principal even if the holder is certain that the call will be exercised. As a result, upon the exercise of a call on a callable debt security held at a premium, the unamortized premium is recorded as a loss in earnings. ASU 2017-08 requires that premiums on certain callable debt securities be amortized to the shortest call date. Securities within the scope of this ASU are those that have explicit, noncontingent call features that are callable at fixed prices and on preset dates. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The impact of adopting this ASU is dependent on the materiality of callable debt securities at the time of adoption.\nThe increase in other expense was primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits as additional mortgage loan originators and staff and a commercial lender were added to support loan growth. Loan expense increased due to the increase in loan originations during 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in the loss on sale of securities was due to an increase in the amount of securities sold during 2017 as compared to 2016. The efficiency ratio decreased due to increased net interest income and other income for the current period.\nOther Income. The following table summarizes other income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from Ottawa Savings Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders, and interest and principal on outstanding debt, if any. The Company's primary source of income is dividends received from Ottawa Savings Bank. The amount of dividends that Ottawa Savings Bank may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year, without the receipt of prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board, but with prior notice to the Federal Reserve Board, cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income (as defined) for the preceding two calendar years. At December 31, 2017, the Company had liquid assets of $9.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash-flows.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an amount necessary to absorb known or inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect each borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nFHLB advances increased $14.0 million, to $15.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2016, to fund the loan growth experienced during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFederal funds sold decreased approximately $0.8 million, or 44.4%, to $0.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $1.7 million at December 31, 2016.\n (1) Includes unamortized discounts and premiums. (2) Amount is net of deferred loan origination (costs) fees, undisbursed loan funds, unamortized discounts and allowance for loan losses and includes non-performing loans. Loan fees included in interest income were $58,000, $55,000, and $40,000 for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. (3) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. (4) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. \nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, investment securities, mortgage-backed securities and other interest-earning assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents), and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of money market accounts, statement savings accounts, individual retirement accounts and certificates of deposit. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of fees, service charges, and gains on the sale of loans. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits, deposit insurance premiums, directors' fees, occupancy, data processing and professional fees. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\n\nThis discussion and analysis reflects the Company's consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements, which appear beginning on page.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nGeneral\nOur primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one-to-four family, non-residential and multi-family real estate and other loans, including loans originated for sale, and the purchase of investment securities. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our loan originations totaled $89.0 million and $56.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, we purchased loans totaling $19.6 million, compared to the purchase of loans totaling $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we received $22.5 million and $18.8 million, respectively, from the sale of loans, resulting in gains of $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Cash received from the sales, calls, maturities and pay-downs on securities totaled $19.4 million and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. We purchased $1.3 million and $7.2 million in securities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For a more detailed breakdown of our loan activity, see the section entitled Item 1. Business-Loan Origination, Purchase and Sales.\u201d\nManagement of Market Risk\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nOur liquidity ratio cannot be calculated using amounts disclosed in our consolidated financial statements, as many of the calculations involve monthly, quarterly, or annual averages. To calculate our liquidity ratio, the average liquidity base from the prior month is used as the denominator to calculate a daily liquidity ratio. The liquidity base consists of savings account balances, certificate of deposit balances, checking and money market balances, deposit loans and borrowings. The daily balances of these components are averaged to arrive at the liquidity base for the month, and the daily cash balances in selected general ledger accounts are used to derive our liquidity position. A daily liquidity ratio is calculated using the liquidity for the day divided by the prior month's average liquidity base. At the end of each month, a monthly liquidity position is calculated using the average liquidity position for the month divided by the prior month's average liquidity base. To calculate quarterly and annual liquidity ratios, we take the average liquidity for the three- or twelve-month period, respectively, and average it.\nThe following table shows the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to changes in outstanding balances and those due to the changes in interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\nLiquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago ( FHLBC\u201d) to provide advances and with Bankers Bank of Wisconsin to purchase Federal Funds. As a member of the FHLBC, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met. We had an available borrowing limit of $60.4 million and $65.3 million from the FHLBC as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bank had $7.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively of available credit from Bankers Bank of Wisconsin to purchase Federal Funds. There were $15.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively of Federal Home Loan Bank advances at December 31, 2017 and 2016 and no Federal Funds purchased outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU simplifies the treatment and accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU 2016-09 became effective for us on January 1, 2017 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that in the future the adoption of this update may result in a marginal amount of volatility within income tax expense, depending on the amount and timing of share-based compensation award activity such as the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, as well as the exercise of stock options.\nNet interest income increased by $1.0 million, or 13.5%, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest and dividend income increased $1.2 million, or 14.4%, primarily due to an increase in the average balances of interest-earning assets of $16.4 million. The increase in net interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as the average cost of funds increased 11 basis points to 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net interest margin increased 5.2% during the year ended December 31, 2017 to 3.84% from 3.65%.\n\n\nDeposit flows are generally affected by the level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by local competitors, and other factors. Deposits increased $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and decreased $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For a more detailed breakdown of our deposit activity, see the section entitled Item 1. Business-Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds.\u201d\nThe tables below set forth, as of the periods indicated, net portfolio value, the estimated changes in our net portfolio value that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.\nTotal deposits increased $10.2 million, or 5.9%, to $182.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $172.5 million at December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to an increase in certificates of deposit of $7.4 million, or 9.1%, an increase in savings account balances of $2.0 million, or 8.2%, and an increase in checking balances of $3.0 million, or 8.1%, partially offset by a decrease in money market balances of $2.2 million, or 7.3% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The increase in certificates of deposit is primarily due to listing service deposits of $5.2 million, while the remaining increase in certificates of deposit and the increase in savings and checking balances is due to management's continued efforts to strategically price interest rates to position the Bank for rising interest rates and customers seeking non-term products as they wait for a better rate environment.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Management recorded a provision for loan losses of $0.6 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in provision expense was primarily due to increases in the loan portfolio, and therefore the need to increase the provision for loan losses. Additionally, net charge-offs were approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan losses was $2.5 million, or 1.18% of total gross loans at December 31, 2017 compared to $2.2 million, or 1.38% of gross loans at December 31, 2016. General reserves were higher at December 31, 2017, when compared to December 31, 2016, as the balances in all loan categories increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. These increases to the allowance were partially offset by improvements in historical loss levels and changes in qualitative factors during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. Additionally, specific reserves as of December 31, 2017 were lower than they were as of December 31, 2016, due to several credits being resolved during 2017 that had reserves as of December 31, 2016. Management's assessment of risk in the portfolio is reflected in the qualitative factors, as discussed on pages 11 and 12. Based on a review of the loans that were in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, management believes that the allowance is maintained at a level that represents its best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio that were both probable and reasonably estimable.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance in this ASU, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee`s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new lease guidance also simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that this standard will have on its financial statements.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $0.9 million increase in income tax expense includes approximately $0.8 million from the re-valuation of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and approximately $0.1 million resulting from the increase in net income before taxes of approximately $0.5 million.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The adoption of the new financial instruments standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe increase in total other income was primarily due to higher revenues related to mortgage banking activity, as gain on sale of loans, loan origination and servicing income increased, an increase in the gain on sale of securities, offset by a decrease in gains on sales of foreclosed real estate. The higher revenues related to mortgage banking activity was a result of increases in originations and sales during 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in the gains on sale of securities was due to an increase in the amount of securities sold during 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease in the gain on sale of foreclosed real estate is primarily due to the sale of fewer properties during 2017 as compared to 2016.\n\nWe maintain a liquidity ratio policy that establishes a target range of 1% to 5% for the liquidity ratio to assist in the management of this metric. However, during the existing low interest rate environment, we have strategically allowed this metric to at times be above 5% to provide for the effective management of extension risk and other interest rate risks.\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $0.4 million, or 35.5%, to $0.8 million compared to net income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributed to an increase in income tax expense of $0.9 million, of which approximately $0.8 million resulted from the re-valuation of the Company's net deferred tax assets due to the December 22, 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and an increase in total other expenses of $0.9 million. The increases in expenses were partially offset by increases in net interest income after provision for loan losses of $0.9 million and a $0.5 million increase in total other income.\nOur cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included with the Consolidated Financial Statements which begin on page of this Form 10-K.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $3.2 million, unfunded commitments under lines of credit of $16.7 million, unfunded commitments on construction loans of $5.6 million, and no unfunded standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2017, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled $40.8 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us, we will have to utilize other funding sources, such as FHLBC advances, in order to maintain our level of assets. Alternatively, we could reduce our level of liquid assets, such as our cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher at the time of renewal.\nThe consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\nWe have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to limit the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. In an attempt to accomplish this, we offer a variety of loan products, some of which are based on the prime rate and some loan products that adjust on one- to-five year intervals, based on various indices including the prime rate and U.S. Treasury securities. To shorten asset duration, we purchase investments, which are usually three to five years in length, as well as balance our investment purchases to ensure extension risk is minimized. In addition, we have attempted to lengthen the maturities of our deposit accounts by offering proportionately higher interest rates for longer terms, 3-5 year certificate accounts and by increasing our core deposits, in which the overall balances are generally less volatile to interest rate fluctuations than certificate accounts.\nStockholders' equity decreased approximately $35,000, but remained constant at $51.9 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease reflects net income of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and an increase in other comprehensive income of $0.1 million related to an increase in the fair value of securities available for sale, partially offset by dividends of $0.5 million paid to shareholders, $0.3 million to re-purchase and cancel outstanding shares of common stock and an approximately $0.2 million net decrease related to allocation of ESOP shares.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $2.2 million, or 36.8%, to $3.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $5.9 million at December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of cash used in investing activities of $28.6 million exceeding cash provided by financing activities of $23.5 million and cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 million. The cash used in investing activities includes the purchase of approximately $14.1 million in auto loans and other net loan increases of $33.5 million, purchases of available for sale securities of $1.3 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $0.2 million, partially offset by sales, calls, maturities and paydowns of available for sale securities of $19.4 million and a decrease in federal funds sold of $0.8 million. The net cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $16.0 million and increases in deposits of $10.2 million, partially offset by a principal reduction in Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $2.0 million, shares repurchased and cancelled of $0.3 million and dividends paid of $0.5 million.\nNet Interest Income. The following table summarizes interest and dividend income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nGeneral. The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of residential mortgage loans, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has established an Asset/Liability Management Committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the Asset/Liability Management Committee, which consists of senior management operating under a policy adopted by the Board of Directors, meets as needed to review our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU simplifies measurement of goodwill and eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The Company should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. The impairment charge is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_text": "Average Balance Sheet\nThe table above indicates that at December 31, 2017, in the event of a 100-basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a decrease of approximately 2.9% in net portfolio value. In the event of a 200-basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a decrease of approximately 7.6% in net portfolio value. For a 300-basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a decreased value of approximately 13.5% in net portfolio value. In the event of a 100-basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience an increase of approximately 1.6% in net portfolio value.\nLoans, net of the allowance for loan losses, increased $46.4 million, or 28.9%, to $207.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $160.6 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, was primarily due to an increase in gross consumer direct and purchased auto loans of $12.3 million, an increase in gross residential mortgage loans of $20.7 million, an increase in gross non-residential real estate loans of $9.6 million and an increase in gross commercial loans of $4.1 million, offset by an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $0.2 million. The changes above are net of normal pay-downs and principal reductions.\nNet Portfolio Value. The net present value of an institution's cash flow from assets, liabilities and off balance sheet items (the institution's net portfolio value or NPV\u201d) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. For periods subsequent to December 31, 2011, institutions are responsible for valuing their own portfolios, or arranging to obtain the required information from a third-party provider. The model utilized by the Company's third-party provider utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumption that the United States Treasury yield curve increases by 100 to 300 basis points, or decreases by 100 basis points instantaneously. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates\u201d column below.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net portfolio value table presented assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or re-pricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net portfolio value table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nManagement uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors. As a result, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect the Company's operating results. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization's portfolio. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. ASU 2016-13 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this update allow for a reclassification of stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and the Company elected to early adopt this guidance effective December 31, 2017. The adoption of this standard resulted in a reclassification of stranded tax effects of $25,108 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.\nWe maintain liquid assets at levels we believe are adequate to meet our liquidity needs. Our liquidity ratio averaged 3.11% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 6.80% for the year ended December 31, 2016. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives.\nSecurities available for sale decreased $18.5 million, or 41.6%, to $26.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $44.6 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to sales, calls and maturities of $14.5 million and pay-downs of $4.9 million, offset by $1.3 million in purchases. The remaining decreases were attributable to net amortization/accretion of premiums and discounts, changes in unrealized gains/losses, and gains/losses on sales.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates. No tax equivalent adjustments were made. All average balances are monthly average balances. Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The amortization of loan fees is included in computing interest income; however, such fees are not material.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract and will also require additional disclosures. The new authoritative guidance was originally effective for reporting periods after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) was issued to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB issued four subsequent ASUs in 2016 which are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance related to ASU 2014-09. The Company's revenue is comprised of net interest income, which is explicitly excluded from the scope of ASU 2014-09, and non-interest income. The Company has completed its overall assessment of non-interest income and review of related contracts potentially affected by the guidance. The Company's assessment indicates the adoption of this guidance will not materially change the method in which non-interest income is recognized. In addition, the Company is evaluating the expanded disclosure requirement. The Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2018 and a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was not necessary.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company's total assets increased $25.2 million, or 11.0%, to $255.4 million at December 31, 2017, from $230.2 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $46.4 million in the net loan portfolio, offset by decreases in securities available for sale of $18.5 million and decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 million.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities, other short-term investments, earnings, and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements.\nWe consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. We consider the allowance for loan losses to be our critical accounting policy.\nOther Expenses. The following table summarizes other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n\n (1) Computed as other expenses divided by the sum of net interest income and other income. \nFor additional information on our risk management strategy, see the sections entitled, Item 1. Business - Delinquent Loans,\u201d Item 1. Business - Nonperforming Assets,\u201d Item 1. Business Ratios,\u201d and Item 1. Business - Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20), Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which shortens the period of amortization of the premium on certain callable debt securities to the earliest call date. Currently, generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) excludes certain callable debt securities from consideration of early repayment of principal even if the holder is certain that the call will be exercised. As a result, upon the exercise of a call on a callable debt security held at a premium, the unamortized premium is recorded as a loss in earnings. ASU 2017-08 requires that premiums on certain callable debt securities be amortized to the shortest call date. Securities within the scope of this ASU are those that have explicit, noncontingent call features that are callable at fixed prices and on preset dates. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The impact of adopting this ASU is dependent on the materiality of callable debt securities at the time of adoption.\nThe increase in other expense was primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits as additional mortgage loan originators and staff and a commercial lender were added to support loan growth. Loan expense increased due to the increase in loan originations during 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in the loss on sale of securities was due to an increase in the amount of securities sold during 2017 as compared to 2016. The efficiency ratio decreased due to increased net interest income and other income for the current period.\nOther Income. The following table summarizes other income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from Ottawa Savings Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders, and interest and principal on outstanding debt, if any. The Company's primary source of income is dividends received from Ottawa Savings Bank. The amount of dividends that Ottawa Savings Bank may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year, without the receipt of prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board, but with prior notice to the Federal Reserve Board, cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income (as defined) for the preceding two calendar years. At December 31, 2017, the Company had liquid assets of $9.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash-flows.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an amount necessary to absorb known or inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect each borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nFHLB advances increased $14.0 million, to $15.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2016, to fund the loan growth experienced during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFederal funds sold decreased approximately $0.8 million, or 44.4%, to $0.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $1.7 million at December 31, 2016.\n (1) Includes unamortized discounts and premiums. (2) Amount is net of deferred loan origination (costs) fees, undisbursed loan funds, unamortized discounts and allowance for loan losses and includes non-performing loans. Loan fees included in interest income were $58,000, $55,000, and $40,000 for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. (3) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. (4) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. \nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, investment securities, mortgage-backed securities and other interest-earning assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents), and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of money market accounts, statement savings accounts, individual retirement accounts and certificates of deposit. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of fees, service charges, and gains on the sale of loans. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits, deposit insurance premiums, directors' fees, occupancy, data processing and professional fees. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\n\nThis discussion and analysis reflects the Company's consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements, which appear beginning on page.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nGeneral\nOur primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one-to-four family, non-residential and multi-family real estate and other loans, including loans originated for sale, and the purchase of investment securities. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our loan originations totaled $89.0 million and $56.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, we purchased loans totaling $19.6 million, compared to the purchase of loans totaling $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we received $22.5 million and $18.8 million, respectively, from the sale of loans, resulting in gains of $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Cash received from the sales, calls, maturities and pay-downs on securities totaled $19.4 million and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. We purchased $1.3 million and $7.2 million in securities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For a more detailed breakdown of our loan activity, see the section entitled Item 1. Business-Loan Origination, Purchase and Sales.\u201d\nManagement of Market Risk\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nOur liquidity ratio cannot be calculated using amounts disclosed in our consolidated financial statements, as many of the calculations involve monthly, quarterly, or annual averages. To calculate our liquidity ratio, the average liquidity base from the prior month is used as the denominator to calculate a daily liquidity ratio. The liquidity base consists of savings account balances, certificate of deposit balances, checking and money market balances, deposit loans and borrowings. The daily balances of these components are averaged to arrive at the liquidity base for the month, and the daily cash balances in selected general ledger accounts are used to derive our liquidity position. A daily liquidity ratio is calculated using the liquidity for the day divided by the prior month's average liquidity base. At the end of each month, a monthly liquidity position is calculated using the average liquidity position for the month divided by the prior month's average liquidity base. To calculate quarterly and annual liquidity ratios, we take the average liquidity for the three- or twelve-month period, respectively, and average it.\nThe following table shows the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to changes in outstanding balances and those due to the changes in interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\nLiquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago ( FHLBC\u201d) to provide advances and with Bankers Bank of Wisconsin to purchase Federal Funds. As a member of the FHLBC, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met. We had an available borrowing limit of $60.4 million and $65.3 million from the FHLBC as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bank had $7.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively of available credit from Bankers Bank of Wisconsin to purchase Federal Funds. There were $15.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively of Federal Home Loan Bank advances at December 31, 2017 and 2016 and no Federal Funds purchased outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU simplifies the treatment and accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU 2016-09 became effective for us on January 1, 2017 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that in the future the adoption of this update may result in a marginal amount of volatility within income tax expense, depending on the amount and timing of share-based compensation award activity such as the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, as well as the exercise of stock options.\nNet interest income increased by $1.0 million, or 13.5%, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest and dividend income increased $1.2 million, or 14.4%, primarily due to an increase in the average balances of interest-earning assets of $16.4 million. The increase in net interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as the average cost of funds increased 11 basis points to 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net interest margin increased 5.2% during the year ended December 31, 2017 to 3.84% from 3.65%.\n\n\nDeposit flows are generally affected by the level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by local competitors, and other factors. Deposits increased $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and decreased $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For a more detailed breakdown of our deposit activity, see the section entitled Item 1. Business-Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds.\u201d\nThe tables below set forth, as of the periods indicated, net portfolio value, the estimated changes in our net portfolio value that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.\nTotal deposits increased $10.2 million, or 5.9%, to $182.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $172.5 million at December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to an increase in certificates of deposit of $7.4 million, or 9.1%, an increase in savings account balances of $2.0 million, or 8.2%, and an increase in checking balances of $3.0 million, or 8.1%, partially offset by a decrease in money market balances of $2.2 million, or 7.3% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The increase in certificates of deposit is primarily due to listing service deposits of $5.2 million, while the remaining increase in certificates of deposit and the increase in savings and checking balances is due to management's continued efforts to strategically price interest rates to position the Bank for rising interest rates and customers seeking non-term products as they wait for a better rate environment.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Management recorded a provision for loan losses of $0.6 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in provision expense was primarily due to increases in the loan portfolio, and therefore the need to increase the provision for loan losses. Additionally, net charge-offs were approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan losses was $2.5 million, or 1.18% of total gross loans at December 31, 2017 compared to $2.2 million, or 1.38% of gross loans at December 31, 2016. General reserves were higher at December 31, 2017, when compared to December 31, 2016, as the balances in all loan categories increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. These increases to the allowance were partially offset by improvements in historical loss levels and changes in qualitative factors during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. Additionally, specific reserves as of December 31, 2017 were lower than they were as of December 31, 2016, due to several credits being resolved during 2017 that had reserves as of December 31, 2016. Management's assessment of risk in the portfolio is reflected in the qualitative factors, as discussed on pages 11 and 12. Based on a review of the loans that were in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, management believes that the allowance is maintained at a level that represents its best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio that were both probable and reasonably estimable.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance in this ASU, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee`s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new lease guidance also simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that this standard will have on its financial statements.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $0.9 million increase in income tax expense includes approximately $0.8 million from the re-valuation of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and approximately $0.1 million resulting from the increase in net income before taxes of approximately $0.5 million.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The adoption of the new financial instruments standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe increase in total other income was primarily due to higher revenues related to mortgage banking activity, as gain on sale of loans, loan origination and servicing income increased, an increase in the gain on sale of securities, offset by a decrease in gains on sales of foreclosed real estate. The higher revenues related to mortgage banking activity was a result of increases in originations and sales during 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in the gains on sale of securities was due to an increase in the amount of securities sold during 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease in the gain on sale of foreclosed real estate is primarily due to the sale of fewer properties during 2017 as compared to 2016.\n\nWe maintain a liquidity ratio policy that establishes a target range of 1% to 5% for the liquidity ratio to assist in the management of this metric. However, during the existing low interest rate environment, we have strategically allowed this metric to at times be above 5% to provide for the effective management of extension risk and other interest rate risks.\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $0.4 million, or 35.5%, to $0.8 million compared to net income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributed to an increase in income tax expense of $0.9 million, of which approximately $0.8 million resulted from the re-valuation of the Company's net deferred tax assets due to the December 22, 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and an increase in total other expenses of $0.9 million. The increases in expenses were partially offset by increases in net interest income after provision for loan losses of $0.9 million and a $0.5 million increase in total other income.\nOur cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included with the Consolidated Financial Statements which begin on page of this Form 10-K.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $3.2 million, unfunded commitments under lines of credit of $16.7 million, unfunded commitments on construction loans of $5.6 million, and no unfunded standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2017, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled $40.8 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us, we will have to utilize other funding sources, such as FHLBC advances, in order to maintain our level of assets. Alternatively, we could reduce our level of liquid assets, such as our cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher at the time of renewal.\nThe consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\nWe have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to limit the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. In an attempt to accomplish this, we offer a variety of loan products, some of which are based on the prime rate and some loan products that adjust on one- to-five year intervals, based on various indices including the prime rate and U.S. Treasury securities. To shorten asset duration, we purchase investments, which are usually three to five years in length, as well as balance our investment purchases to ensure extension risk is minimized. In addition, we have attempted to lengthen the maturities of our deposit accounts by offering proportionately higher interest rates for longer terms, 3-5 year certificate accounts and by increasing our core deposits, in which the overall balances are generally less volatile to interest rate fluctuations than certificate accounts.\nStockholders' equity decreased approximately $35,000, but remained constant at $51.9 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease reflects net income of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and an increase in other comprehensive income of $0.1 million related to an increase in the fair value of securities available for sale, partially offset by dividends of $0.5 million paid to shareholders, $0.3 million to re-purchase and cancel outstanding shares of common stock and an approximately $0.2 million net decrease related to allocation of ESOP shares.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $2.2 million, or 36.8%, to $3.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $5.9 million at December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of cash used in investing activities of $28.6 million exceeding cash provided by financing activities of $23.5 million and cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 million. The cash used in investing activities includes the purchase of approximately $14.1 million in auto loans and other net loan increases of $33.5 million, purchases of available for sale securities of $1.3 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $0.2 million, partially offset by sales, calls, maturities and paydowns of available for sale securities of $19.4 million and a decrease in federal funds sold of $0.8 million. The net cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $16.0 million and increases in deposits of $10.2 million, partially offset by a principal reduction in Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $2.0 million, shares repurchased and cancelled of $0.3 million and dividends paid of $0.5 million.\nNet Interest Income. The following table summarizes interest and dividend income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nGeneral. The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of residential mortgage loans, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has established an Asset/Liability Management Committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the Asset/Liability Management Committee, which consists of senior management operating under a policy adopted by the Board of Directors, meets as needed to review our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU simplifies measurement of goodwill and eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The Company should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. The impairment charge is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
