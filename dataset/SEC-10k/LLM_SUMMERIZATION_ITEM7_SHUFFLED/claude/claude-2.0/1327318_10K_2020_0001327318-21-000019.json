Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included herein. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere herein. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nTrueCar is a leading automotive digital marketplace that enables car buyers to connect to our network of Certified Dealers. We are building the industry's most personalized and efficient car buying experience as we seek to bring more of the purchasing process online.\nWe have established a diverse software ecosystem on a common technology infrastructure, powered by proprietary data and analytics. Our company-branded platform is available on our TrueCar website and mobile applications. In addition, we customize and operate our platform on a co-branded basis for our many affinity group marketing partners, including financial institutions like PenFed and American Express; membership-based organizations like Consumer Reports, AARP, Sam's Club, and AAA; and employee buying programs for large enterprises such as IBM and Walmart. We enable users to obtain market-based pricing data on new and used cars, and to connect with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We also allow automobile manufacturers, known in the industry as OEMs, to connect with TrueCar users during the purchase process and efficiently deliver targeted incentives to consumers.\nWe benefit consumers by providing information related to what others have paid for a make, model and trim of car in their area and price offers on actual vehicle inventory, which we refer to as VIN-based offers, from our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. VIN-based offers provide consumers with price offers for specific vehicles from specific dealers. We benefit our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers by enabling them to attract these informed, in-market consumers in a cost-effective, accountable manner, which we believe helps them to sell more cars profitably. We benefit OEMs by allowing them to more effectively target their incentive spending at deep-in-market consumers during their purchase process.\nOur network of TrueCar Certified Dealers consists primarily of new car franchises, representing all major makes of cars, as well as independent dealers selling used vehicles. TrueCar Certified Dealers operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nOur subsidiary, TCDS, provides our TrueCar Trade and Payments products. Our Trade solution gives consumers information on the value of their trade-in vehicles and enables them to obtain a guaranteed trade-in price before setting foot in the dealership. This valuation is, in turn, backed by a third-party guarantee to dealers that the vehicles will be repurchased at the indicated price if the dealer does not want to keep them. Our Payments solution leverages the digital retailing technology of our DealerScience subsidiary, acquired in December 2018, to help consumers calculate accurate monthly payments.\nFinally, our former ALG subsidiary provided forecasts and consulting services regarding determination of the residual value of an automobile at given future points in time. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition, financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease, and fleet portfolios. On November 30, 2020, we divested ALG to J.D. Power. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further details.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of $278.7 million and recorded a net income of $76.5 million, which comprised of $96.4 million income from discontinued operations offset by $19.8 million loss from continuing operations.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus, a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and the world. This has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including quarantines, shelter-in-place\u201d and stay-at-home\u201d orders, travel restrictions, and temporary closures of non-essential businesses. We have taken proactive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers by closing our offices, requiring employees to work from home and suspending travel, in-person meetings and visits with our customers. We expect to continue these measures until the pandemic is adequately contained as determined by authorities.\nWe are monitoring the impact of the pandemic on our business and implementing plans to take appropriate actions to adapt to changing circumstances arising from the pandemic. Specifically, we have launched Buy from Home\u201d badge labeling of dealers\noffering such solutions designed to help consumers and dealers safely and remotely navigate car buying in response to social distancing guidelines during COVID-19. Dealers badged with Buy from Home\u201d on the TrueCar platform offer the following features:\n\u2022Remote paperwork processing\n\u2022Home vehicle delivery\n\u2022Verified vehicle sanitization\nAdditionally, we are accelerating our investment in digital automotive retailing as we seek to bring more of the purchasing process online to further support the needs of our dealers and consumers during this challenging and changing environment.\nWe have experienced significant disruptions since the outbreak was declared a pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted our results of operations as reflected in the year over year decline in revenues and could further impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity and duration of the outbreak, actions taken by government authorities, economic uncertainty, the increasing number of consumers who are unemployed, and vehicle inventory shortages caused by closures in OEM production facilities. Our future results of operations and liquidity could be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms and concessions that we may provide to our customers. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional disclosures of risks related to COVID-19.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make operating and strategic decisions.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Monthly Unique Visitors </td> <td>8,354,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,441,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,520,734 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units (1) </td> <td>766,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>998,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,005,029 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monetization </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>333 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Dealer Count </td> <td>10,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,674 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent Dealer Count </td> <td>3,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,655 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)We issued full credits of the amount originally invoiced with respect to 17,655, 21,201, and 23,885 units during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As discussed in the description of the units metric below, we have not adjusted the number of units downward to reflect these credited units.\nAverage Monthly Unique Visitors\nWe define a monthly unique visitor as an individual who has visited our website, our landing page on our affinity group marketing partner sites, or our mobile applications within a calendar month. We identify unique visitors through cookies for browser-based visits on either a desktop computer or mobile device and through device IDs for mobile application visits. In addition, if a TrueCar.com user logs in, we supplement their identification with their log-in credentials to attempt to avoid double counting on TrueCar.com across devices, browsers and mobile applications. If an individual accesses our service using different devices or different browsers on the same device within a given month, the first access through each such device or browser is counted as a separate monthly unique visitor, except where adjusted based upon TrueCar.com log-in information. We calculate average monthly unique visitors as the sum of the monthly unique visitors in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We view our average monthly unique visitors as a key indicator of the growth in our business and audience reach, the strength of our brand, and the visibility of car-buying services to the member base of our affinity group marketing partners.\nThe number of average monthly unique visitors increased 12.3% to approximately 8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from approximately 7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to improvements to our search engine optimization strategy and a surge in online browsing as a result of COVID-19.\nUnits\nWe define units as the number of automobiles purchased from TrueCar Certified Dealers that are matched to users of TrueCar.com, our TrueCar-branded mobile applications or the car-buying sites and mobile applications we maintain for our affinity group marketing partners. A unit is counted after we have matched the sale to a TrueCar user with one of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We view units as a key indicator of the health of our business, the effectiveness of our product and the size and geographic coverage of our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers.\nOn occasion, we issue credits to our TrueCar Certified Dealers with respect to units sold. However, we do not adjust our unit metric for these credits as we believe that in most cases a vehicle has in fact been purchased through our platform given the high degree of accuracy of our sales matching process. Credits are most frequently issued to a dealer that claims that it had a pre-existing relationship with a purchaser of a vehicle, and we determine whether we will issue a credit based on a number of factors, including the facts and circumstances related to the dealer claim and the level of claim activity at the dealership. In most cases, we issue credits in order to maintain strong business relations with the dealer and not because we have made an erroneous sales match or billing error.\nThe number of units decreased 23.2% to 766,413 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 998,495 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The unit decrease is primarily due to COVID-19, which was declared by the World Health Organization as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, as well as the wind-down of our partnership with USAA that ended on September 30, 2020. With COVID-19, social distancing was encouraged with many government authorities issuing shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders, the closing of non-essential businesses, and temporary shutdowns of OEM production facilities. In 2021, we expect total units to be impacted by the continued effects of COVID-19 as well as the termination of the USAA partnership.\nMonetization\nWe define monetization as the average transaction revenue per unit, which we calculate by dividing all of our transaction revenue (dealer revenue and OEM incentives revenue) in a given period by the number of units in that period. Our monetization increased by 5.1% to $352 during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $335 during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to subscription revenue that did not readjust with lower unit volumes as well as increases within newer revenue streams, offset by concessions provided to certain subscription arrangements in the second quarter of 2020. We expect downward pressure on monetization in 2021 as we expect units to outpace rate recapture.\nFranchise Dealer Count\nWe define franchise dealer count as the number of franchise dealers in the network of TrueCar Certified Dealers who participate in our Auto Buying Program at the end of a given period. This number is calculated by counting the number of brands of new cars sold at each individual location, or rooftop, regardless of the size of the dealership that owns the rooftop. The network is comprised of dealers with a range of unit sales volume per dealer, with dealers representing certain brands consistently achieving higher than average unit sales volume. We view our ability to increase our franchise dealer count, particularly dealers representing high volume brands, as an indicator of our market penetration and the likelihood of converting users of our platform into unit sales. Our TrueCar Certified Dealer network includes independent non-franchised dealers that primarily sell used cars and are not included in franchise dealer count.\nOur franchise dealer count decreased to 10,589 at December 31, 2020 from 12,565 at December 31, 2019 and from 12,674 at December 31, 2018. The decline in franchise dealer count was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as government authorities imposed restrictions on retail activity and a number of dealers opting to suspend their marketing spend to preserve their profitability during times of economic uncertainty. We expect our franchise dealer count to continue to fluctuate due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the termination of our partnership with USAA Federal Savings Bank.\nIndependent Dealer Count\nWe define independent dealer count as the number of independent dealers in the network of TrueCar Certified Dealers who participate in our Auto Buying Program at the end of a given period that exclusively sell used vehicles and are not directly affiliated with a new car manufacturer. This number is calculated by counting each location, or rooftop, individually, regardless of the size of the dealership that owns the rooftop. Our independent dealer count decreased to 3,794 at December 31, 2020 from 4,395 at December 31, 2019 and from 3,655 at December 31, 2018. The decline in independent dealer count was primarily due to suspensions, cancellations or going-out-of-business due to COVID-19. We expect our independent dealer count to continue to fluctuate due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPresentation of Financial Statements\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries in accordance with FASB ASC 810 - Consolidation. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe report our financial results as one operating segment, with three distinct service offerings: Dealer products and services, OEM incentives, and other. Our operating results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker on a consolidated basis, principally to make decisions about how we allocate our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance. Our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews revenue for each of our dealer, OEM incentives and other offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the factors driving our business.\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements, the ALG divestiture met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Therefore, we are reporting the historical results of ALG, including the results of operations, cash flows, and related assets and liabilities, as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenues\nOur revenues are comprised primarily of dealer revenue and OEM incentives revenue. We recognize transaction revenue for certain of our Auto Buying Program and OEM incentives arrangements at the time introductions and incentives are delivered based upon expected subsequent vehicle sales between the Auto Buying Program user and the dealer.\nDealer. Dealer revenue is comprised of Auto Buying Program revenue as well as revenue from TrueCar Trade and DealerScience. During 2020, we introduced TrueCar Access, which offers dealers our subscription-based package that combines our TrueCar Trade solution and payments solution from DealerScience.\nAuto Buying Program revenue consists of fees paid by dealers participating in our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. Dealers pay us these fees on a per-vehicle basis for sales to our users, on a per-introduction basis for sales to our users or in the form of a subscription arrangement. Subscription arrangements fall into several types: flat-rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales, which we refer to as guaranteed-sales subscriptions, and subscriptions based on introduction volume, including those subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions, which we refer to as guaranteed-introductions subscriptions. Additionally, certain dealers pay an incremental subscription fee for add-on products within our Auto Buying Program.\nUnder flat-rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of introductions made to users of our platform by the dealer.\nUnder guaranteed-sales subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the dealer. If the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. As of January 1, 2019, we no longer offer guaranteed sales subscription arrangements in California, and we transferred all California dealers from this billing method to flat-rate subscription arrangements before that date.\nCertain of our subscription arrangements are charged based on volume of introductions provided while other introduction-based subscription arrangements operate under a guaranteed-introductions model. Under guaranteed-introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the dealer. If the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees.\nFor guaranteed-sales and guaranteed-introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of sales generated or introductions delivered through our platform during the subscription period multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction or (ii) the guaranteed number of sales or introductions multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction.\nWe offer additional add-on products to eligible dealers as part of the Auto Buying Program to increase traffic and retarget in-market consumers. These products include TrueCar Sponsored Listings and TrueCar Reach. TrueCar Sponsor Listings enables a\ndealer to place qualifying vehicles at more prominent positions within the used car search results page. TrueCar Reach is a service offered to retarget in-market consumers on the dealer's behalf with co-branded emails. Fees are charged based on a monthly subscription rate for the right to sponsor up to a set number of vehicles at any time throughout the month under Sponsored Listings. Fees for our Reach product are also charged on a flat monthly rate regardless of the number of emails delivered.\nTrueCar Trade revenue consists of dealers who pay monthly subscription fees that vary depending on the level of trade service selected. Depending on their subscription terms, some dealers pay additional transaction fees for each vehicle purchased from a consumer that was introduced via TrueCar Trade.\nDealerScience revenue consists of monthly subscription fees paid by dealers for access to the DealerScience products and services. DealerScience provides dealers with advanced digital retailing software tools that allow them to calculate accurate monthly payments, expedite vehicle desking, which is the process of presenting and agreeing upon financial terms and financing options, and streamline the consumers' experience from shopping to showroom.\nOEM Incentives. OEM incentives revenue consists of fees paid by automobile manufacturers, or OEMs, to promote the sale of their vehicles through the offering of additional consumer incentives to members of our affinity group marketing partners. These OEMs pay us a subscription or per-vehicle fee for promotion of the incentive.\nOther Revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of fees earned associated with the USAA transition services agreement for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Cost of revenue includes expenses related to the fulfillment of our services, consisting primarily of data costs and licensing fees paid to third-party service providers and expenses related to operating our website and mobile applications, including data center costs; hosting fees; data processing costs required to deliver introductions to our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers; employee costs related to certain dealer operations and sales matching; and facilities costs. Cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization of software costs and other hosting and data infrastructure equipment used to operate our platforms, which are included in the depreciation and amortization line item on our statements of comprehensive loss.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of television, digital, and radio advertising; media production costs; affinity group partner marketing fees, which also include loan subvention costs where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of consumers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners; common stock warrants issued to USAA; marketing sponsorship programs; and digital customer acquisition. See Part III, Item 13 Certain Relationships, Related Party and Other Transactions - Strategic Partnerships - United Services Automobile Association\u201d for a description of our previous arrangements with USAA. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include employee-related expenses for sales, customer support, marketing and public relations employees, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses; third-party contractor fees; and facilities costs. Marketing and advertising costs promote our services and are expensed as incurred, except for media production costs, which are expensed the first time the advertisement is aired.\nTechnology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses; third-party contractor fees; facilities costs; software costs; and costs associated with our product development, product management, research and analytics, and internal IT functions.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses for executive, finance, accounting, legal, and human resources functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal, accounting, and other third-party professional service fees, bad debt, lease exit costs, and facilities costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation consists primarily of depreciation expense recorded on property and equipment. Amortization expense consists primarily of amortization recorded on intangible assets, capitalized software costs, and leasehold improvements.\nInterest Income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily consists of interest on our built-to-suit lease financing obligations in years prior to 2019.\nOther Income. Other income primarily consists of fees earned associated with the transition services agreement with J.D. Power as a result of our ALG divestiture.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. We provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, as it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result of the valuation allowance, our income tax benefit (or expense) is significantly less than the federal statutory rate of 21%. Our benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily arose in connection with the impairment of goodwill, resulting in reduction of indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities. Our benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflects a tax benefit associated with the intraperiod allocation required by ASC 740.\nWe had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $269.2 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $215.1 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, we also had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $13.0 million and $10.2 million, respectively. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code impose substantial restrictions on the use of net operating losses and other tax attributes in the event of a cumulative ownership change\u201d of a corporation of more than 50% over a three-year period. We experienced a cumulative ownership change as of December 31, 2019 within the meanings of Sections 382 and 383. During the second quarter of 2020, we estimated that up to $86.8 million and $2.5 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, may expire unused. This limitation resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets of $18.4 million and was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance, with no net tax provision impact. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our Section 382 and 383 limitation to account for the divestiture of ALG's net assets. We estimate that up to $15.2 million and $0.5 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, may expire unused. The Section 382 limitation resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets of $3.2 million and was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance, with no net tax provision impact. Additionally, pending finalization of the 2011-2020 research and development tax credit study, we anticipate that certain federal research and development credit carryforwards may expire unused.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses facing economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency. The CARES Act includes, among other things, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. In addition, on June 29, 2020 California enacted legislation suspending NOL deductions for taxpayers with more than $1 million of business income and imposing limits on the use of tax credits up to $5 million effective for tax years 2020 through 2022. As a result, we plan to utilize California research and development credits to offset California state taxes incurred on the gains from the Divestiture, and thereby diminish our tax assets. We will continue to monitor possible future impact of changes in tax legislation.\nSee Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements included herein for more information about our provision for income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

The decrease in our revenues of $56.4 million, or 16.8%, in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflected a decrease in our dealer revenue offset by an increase in other revenue. Dealer revenue, OEM incentives revenue, and other revenue comprised 90.8%, 6.0%, and 3.2%, respectively, of revenues for 2020 as compared to 94.9%, 4.9%, and 0.2%, respectively, for 2019. The decrease of $65.0 million in dealer revenue for 2020 reflected a decrease in our Auto Buying Program revenue of $65.8 million primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and concessions we provided to certain subscription arrangements as well as the wind-down of our partnership with USAA, offset by increases within newer revenue streams of $0.8 million. These decreases were offset by an increase of $8.4 million in other revenue primarily driven by fees earned related to the USAA transition services agreement for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue remained flat in 2019 as compared to 2018. Dealer revenue, OEM incentives revenue, and other revenue comprised 94.9%, 4.9%, and 0.2%, respectively, of\nrevenues for 2019 as compared to 90.9%, 9.0%, and 0.1%, respectively, of revenues for 2018. The increase of $13.4 million in dealer revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected a 0.6% increase in monetization, along with increases within newer revenue streams of $9.2 million primarily due to our Trade and DealerScience products as well as an increase of $4.2 million due to growth in used car sales in 2019. The decrease of $13.4 million in OEM incentive revenue was primarily due to the lack of recurring revenue from a large OEM client and softness in our existing clients in 2019. Other revenue for 2019 remained materially consistent as compared to 2018.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of revenues </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019.

The benefit from income taxes for 2019 of $1.3 million primarily reflects a tax benefit associated with the intraperiod tax allocation required by ASC 740. The benefit from income taxes for 2018 of $1.2 million primarily reflects a tax benefit associated with the intraperiod tax allocation required by ASC 740.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code impose substantial restrictions on the use of net operating losses and other tax attributes in the event of a cumulative ownership change\u201d of a corporation of more than 50% over a three-year period. We experienced a cumulative ownership change as of December 31, 2019 within the meanings of Sections 382 and 383. During the second quarter of 2020, we estimated that up to $86.8 million and $2.5 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, may expire unused. This limitation resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets of $18.4 million and was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in its valuation allowance, with no net tax provision impact. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our Section 382 and 383 limitation to account for the divestiture of ALG's net assets. We estimate that up to $15.2 million and $0.5 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, may expire unused. The Section 382 limitation resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets of $3.2 million and was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance, with no net tax provision impact. Additionally, pending finalization of the 2011-2020 research and development tax credit study, we anticipate that certain federal research and development credit carryforwards may expire unused.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,697.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019.

include stock-based compensation of $7.2 million incurred in the second quarter of 2019 associated with the acceleration of certain equity awards and the extension of the exercise period for certain vested stock options related to the departures of certain executives, including our former chief executive officer.\n(2)The excluded amounts relate to legal costs incurred in connection with complaints filed by non-TrueCar dealers against TrueCar and consumer class action lawsuits. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the excluded amount also includes a $2.0 million payment received from one of our insurance carriers in settlement of a lawsuit we brought in the fourth quarter of 2017 to recover insured legal fees. We believe the exclusion of these costs and recovery is appropriate to facilitate comparisons of our core operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Based on the nature of the specific claims underlying the excluded litigation matters, once these matters are resolved, we do not believe our operations are likely to entail defending against the types of claims raised by these matters.\n(3)The excluded amounts include $4.6 million in executive severance costs, as well as related recruiting fees of $0.5 million, associated with the separation of our former chief executive officer and the termination of executive-level employees in connection with the change in chief executive officer in the second quarter of 2019. We believe excluding the impact of these terminations and the associated chief executive officer recruiting fees is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of our ongoing operating results.\n(4)The excluded amounts represent charges associated with the restructuring plans undertaken in the second quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2019 to improve efficiency and reduce expenses. We believe excluding the impact of these charges is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of our ongoing operating results.\n(5)The excluded amounts represent external legal, accounting, consulting and other third-party fees and costs we incurred in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisition transactions. These expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. We consider these fees and costs, which are associated with potential merger and acquisition transactions outside the normal course of our operations, to be unrelated to our underlying results of operations and believe that their exclusion provides investors with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business operations.\n(6)The excluded amount represents a non-cash impairment charge we recognized on our goodwill during the first quarter of 2020.\n(7)The excluded amount represents an impairment charge on our ROU assets associated with certain of our existing office locations. We consider these charges to be unrelated to our underlying results of operations and believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons.\n(8)Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP.

We are continuously monitoring our liquidity and anticipated capital requirements in light of the significant uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue levels, the timing and extent of our spending to support our technology and development efforts, costs related to potential acquisitions to further expand our business and product offerings, collection of accounts receivable, macroeconomic activity, and the length and severity of business disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents, and cash from operations, are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\nCredit Facility\nWe are party to a credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank that provides for advances of up to $35.0 million. This credit facility provides a $10.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit and contains an increase option permitting us, subject to the lender's consent, to increase the revolving credit facility by up to $15.0 million, to an aggregate maximum of $50.0 million. The credit facility has a three-year term and matures on February 18, 2021. Prior to the expiration of the credit facility, we extended the maturity date to April 19, 2021. No amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2020. The amount available under the credit facility at December 31, 2020 was $32.2 million, reduced for the letters of credit issued and outstanding under the subfacility of $2.8 million. See Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements herein for more information about our amended credit facility.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our board of directors authorized an open market stock repurchase program (the Program\u201d) of up to $75 million to allow for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through September 30, 2022. The timing and amount of any repurchases is determined by us based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Repurchases of our common stock may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws, open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate us to purchase any minimum number of shares. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased and retired a total of 9.3 million shares under the Program for $42.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, we have a remaining authorization of $32.8 million for future share repurchases.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes net cash derived from operating, investing, and financing activities from continuing operations, as well as net cash from discontinued operations:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Cash Flow Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,077 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(10,277) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,355) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,207) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities </td> <td>(49,238) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(480) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,723 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in continuing operations </td> <td>(29,617) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,012) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,407) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by discontinued operations </td> <td>121,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,773 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,594) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,634) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities of Continuing Operations\nOur net loss and cash flows used in operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support our growth, and marketing and advertising expenses. We have experienced positive operating cash flows despite having experienced a net loss due to the inclusion of non-cash expenses and charges.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2020 was $29.9 million. This was primarily due to a loss from continuing operations of $19.8 million, which adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense of $23.1 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $20.4 million, goodwill impairment of $8.3 million, amortization of lease right-of-use assets of $5.4 million, bad debt expense of $3.0 million, and asset impairment and write-off of $2.4 million primarily due to a ROU asset impairment of $2.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities also included a $14.2 million decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $14.2 million decrease primarily reflected a decrease of $8.2 million in accounts payable primarily due to a decrease in marketing fees payable to our affinity group partners and advertisers, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $6.3 million and a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.1 million driven by reduced accrued legal fees, offset by an increase of $2.3 million in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of cash collections, an increase of $1.3 million in prepaid expense and other assets primarily due to a decrease in prepaid marketing costs.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $12.8 million. This was primarily due to a loss from continuing operations of $58.3 million, which adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense of $36.5 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $20.7 million and amortization of lease right-of-use assets of $5.9 million. Net cash provided by operation activities also included a $3.7 million increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $3.7 million increase primarily reflected an increase of $10.5 in accrued expenses and other current liabilities mainly driven by accrued marketing costs and a $4.0 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of cash collections, offset by a $6.8 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a $4.9 million decrease in accounts payable.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $16.1 million. This was primarily due to a loss from continuing operations of $31.7 million, which adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense of $35.6 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $17.8 million. Net cash provided by operating activities also included a $7.7 million decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $7.7 million decrease primarily reflected a $9.0 million decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of cash collections, a $3.6 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to an increase in prepaid marketing costs, offset by a $7.5 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to an increase in marketing fees payable to our affinity group partners and advertisers.\nInvesting Activities of Continuing Operations\nOur investing activities consist primarily of cash paid for equity method investment, the acquisition of DealerScience and capital expenditures for capitalized software development costs and property and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities of $10.3 million during 2020 was for purchases of property and equipment, consisting primary of $9.1 million of investments in software.\nCash used in investing activities of $33.4 million during 2019 resulted primarily from a $23.2 million equity method investment in Accu-Trade as well as $10.2 million of purchases of property and equipment, consisting primarily of $9.8 million of investments in software.\nCash used in investing activities of $42.2 million during 2018 resulted primarily from $26.9 million of cash paid for the acquisition of DealerScience and $16.1 million of purchases of property and equipment, consisting primary of $12.5 million of investments in software.\nFinancing Activities of Continuing Operations\nCash used in financing activities of $49.2 million during 2020 primarily represents payments of $42.8 million for the repurchase of our common stock, taxes paid of $4.3 million for the net shares settlement of equity awards, and a $2.3 million payment related to the fair value portion of a contingent consideration related to our 2018 acquisition of DealerScience.\nCash used in financing activities of $0.5 million for 2019 reflects taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards of $3.3 million, offset by $2.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities of $16.7 million for 2018 reflects $19.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards of $3.0 million.\nNet Cash Provided by Discontinued Operations\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations of $121.4 million in 2020 includes net cash provided by operating activities of $9.2 million and cash provided by investing activities of $112.2 million, primarily from cash proceeds received from the sale of ALG. See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations of $6.4 million in 2019 includes net cash provided by operating activities of $7.5 million, offset by cash used in investing activities of $1.1 million for purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations of $7.8 million in 2018 includes net cash provided by operating activities of $8.8 million, offset by cash used in investing activities of $1.0 million for purchases of property and equipment.\nContractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nSet forth below is information concerning our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> Less Than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than 5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,619 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (2) </td> <td>14,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent Consideration (3)\n</td> <td>2,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,619 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Lease obligations consist of various leases for office space and have not been reduced by minimum non-cancelable sublease rentals aggregating $1.5 million.\n(2) Purchase obligations include long-term agreements to purchase data information, software related licenses and support services, and other obligations that are enforceable and legally binding as of December 31, 2020. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.\n(3) Contingent consideration as part of the DealerScience acquisition relates to the second earnout payment presented at its fair value. The undiscounted earnout payment of $2.5 million for DealerScience is due in 2021.\nContingent obligations arising from unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the contractual obligations because it is expected that the unrecognized benefits would only result in an insignificant amount of cash payments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, as part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions on an ongoing basis and that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, sales allowances and allowances for doubtful accounts, the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, the recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, income taxes, and the expensing and capitalization of software and website development costs have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe adopted the new revenue standard as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The updated standard replaces all pre-existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with prior revenue guidance.\nWe recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligation or obligations are satisfied.\nDeferred revenue is recognized on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets when payments are received in advance of us meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria described above.\nDealer Revenue\nDealer revenue is comprised of Auto Buying Program revenue as well as revenue from TrueCar Trade and DealerScience. During 2020, we introduced TrueCar Access, which offers dealers our subscription-based package product offerings that combine our TrueCar Trade solution and payments solution from DealerScience.\nOur Auto Buying Program revenue includes fees paid by customers participating in the Company's dealer network with which the Company has an agreement ( TrueCar Certified Dealers\u201d or Dealers\u201d). TrueCar Certified Dealers pay us fees in one of three ways: on a per-vehicle basis for sales to Auto Buying Program users, on a per-introduction basis for sales to Auto Buying Program users or under a subscription arrangement. Additionally, certain Dealers pay an incremental subscription fee for add-on products within our Auto Buying Program. Contracts are cancellable by the Dealer or us at any time. We do not provide significant dealer financing terms.\nOur performance obligation to TrueCar Certified Dealers is the same for all payment types for our Auto Buying Program revenues: to provide Dealers with introductions to in-market consumers through the use of the TrueCar platform, so that those Dealers have the opportunity to sell vehicles to those consumers. Control transfers to Dealers upon delivery of introductions, which is the point at which we recognize revenue.\nWhen a user decides to proceed with a vehicle purchase through us, the user provides his or her name, address, e-mail, and phone number during the process of obtaining price offers on actual vehicle inventory, which gives us the identity and source of a TrueCar introduction provided to a specific Dealer before an actual sale occurs. After a sale occurs, we receive information regarding the sale, including the identity of the purchaser, through the Dealer Management System used by the Dealer that made the sale. We also receive information regarding vehicle sales from a variety of other data sources, including third-party car sales aggregators, car dealer networks, and other publicly available sources (collectively, sales data\u201d) and we use this sales data to further verify that a sale has occurred between an Auto Buying Program user and a TrueCar Certified Dealer, as well as to invoice the Dealer shortly after the completion of the sales transaction. Actual vehicle sales data is reported on a daily basis shortly following the date of sale.\nPay-Per-Sale. Under the old revenue standard, in years prior to 2018, we recognized revenue for fee arrangements based on a per-vehicle basis when the vehicle sale had occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the Dealer. Under the new revenue standard for fee arrangements based on a pay-per-sale billing model, revenue for the Auto Buying Program is recognized when introductions are delivered to the Dealer and for the amount that the Company estimates it will be able to earn. To formulate this estimate, we use the expected value method based primarily on an analysis of the expected number of sales resulting from in-period introductions. This estimate is based on historical introductions to vehicle sale close rate trends as well as actual sales measured in period. Under the contractual terms and conditions of arrangements with TrueCar Certified Dealers that pay on a per-vehicle-sale basis, the Dealer is not obligated to pay until a vehicle sale has occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the Dealer, for which the introduction was provided by us to the Dealer. Contractually, the Dealers' obligation to pay is not contingent on verification or acceptance of the transaction by the Dealer. As a result, revenue recognition occurs earlier than billing as an estimate of the variable consideration to be received upon control transfer of the delivered introduction, resulting in a contract asset.\nPay-Per-Introduction. Under fee arrangements based on a pay-per-introduction billing model, revenue for the Auto Buying Program is recognized when introductions are delivered.\nWe also recognize revenue from Dealers under subscription agreements. Subscription fee arrangements are short-term in nature with terms ranging from one to six months and are also cancellable by the Dealer or us at any time. Subscription arrangements fall into three types: flat-rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales ( guaranteed sales\u201d), and subscriptions based on introduction volume, including those subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions ( guaranteed introductions\u201d). For all subscription arrangements, we recognize the fees as revenue when introductions are delivered by allocating a portion of the monthly subscription fee to each delivered introduction. For guaranteed sales and guaranteed introduction subscriptions, the amount allocated is adjusted at the end of each month for any credits, as described below. Total revenue recognized in any given month remains unchanged from the old revenue standard for subscription arrangements.\nFlat-Rate Subscription. Under flat-rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of introductions provided by us to the Dealer or sales made to users of our platform by the Dealer.\nGuaranteed-Sales Subscription. Under guaranteed-sales subscription arrangements, monthly fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the Dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the Dealer. If the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. As of January 1, 2019, we no longer offer guaranteed sales subscription arrangements in California, and we transferred all California dealers from this billing method to flat-rate subscription arrangements before that date.\nGuaranteed-Introductions Subscription. Under guaranteed-introductions subscription arrangements, monthly fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the Dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the Dealer. If the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees.\nAuto Buying Program Add-On Features. We offer additional add-on products to eligible Dealers as part of the Auto Buying Program to increase traffic and retarget in-market consumers. These products include TrueCar Sponsored Listings ( Sponsored Listings\u201d) and TrueCar Reach ( Reach\u201d). Sponsored Listings enables a Dealer to place qualifying vehicles at more prominent positions within the used car search results page. Reach is a service offered to retarget in-market consumers on the Dealer's behalf with co-branded emails. Fees are charged based on a monthly subscription rate for the right to sponsor up to a set number of vehicles at any time throughout the month under Sponsored Listings. Fees for our Reach product are also charged on a flat monthly rate regardless of the number of emails delivered. Subscription fees are recognized on a monthly basis.\nTrueCar Trade. TrueCar Trade provides consumers with information on the value of their trade-in vehicles, while providing Dealers with introductions to these in-market consumers so that those Dealers have the opportunity to buy trade-in vehicles from those consumers. Dealers pay monthly subscription fees for access to TrueCar Trade that vary depending on the level of service selected. Depending on their subscription terms, some dealers pay additional transaction fees for each vehicle purchased from a consumer that was introduced through TrueCar Trade. Subscription fees are recognized on a monthly basis, while transaction fees for vehicles purchased by a Dealer are estimated and recognized at the point in time the introduction between the dealer and consumer occurs.\nDealerScience. DealerScience revenues consist of monthly subscription fees paid by dealers for access to DealerScience's products and services. DealerScience provides dealers with advanced digital retailing software tools that allow them to calculate accurate monthly payments, expedite vehicle desking, which is the process of presenting and agreeing upon financial terms and financing options, and streamline the consumers' experience from shopping to showroom. Dealers pay monthly subscription fees for access to the software. Subscription fees are recognized on a monthly basis.\nOEM Incentives Revenue\nWe enter into arrangements with OEMs to promote the sale of their vehicles primarily through the offering of additional consumer incentives. These manufacturers pay us a per-vehicle fee for promotion of the incentive after the sale of the vehicle has occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the dealer. Under the old revenue standard, in years prior to 2018, we recognized as revenue the per-vehicle incentive fee at the time the sale of the vehicle occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the dealer. Under the new revenue standard, our performance obligation to OEMs is to deliver incentive offers to consumers. Control transfers upon delivery of incentive offers, which is the point at which we recognize revenue. We recognize revenue for the amount that we estimate we will be able to earn. To formulate this estimate, we use the expected value method based primarily on an analysis of the expected number of sales resulting from in-period incentive offers delivered. This estimate is based on historical incentive offers to vehicle sales close rate trends as well as delivered incentive offers resulting in actual sales measured in period. As a result, revenue recognition occurs earlier than billing as an estimate of the variable consideration to be received upon control transfer, resulting in a contract asset.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues in the past have been immaterial. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other revenues primarily consists of fees earned related to the USAA transition services agreement that terminated on September 30, 2020.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts\nIn years prior to 2020, we determined our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical write-off experience and specific circumstances that make it likely that recovery will not occur. We reviewed the allowance for doubtful accounts periodically and assessed the aging of account balances, with an emphasis on those that are past due over ninety days. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting guidance on measuring credit losses on our trade accounts receivable. The new credit loss guidance replaces the old model for measuring the allowance for credit losses with a model that is based on the expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new credit loss model, lifetime expected credit losses are measured and recognized at each reporting date based on historical, current and forecast information.\nUnder the new guidance, we consider the need to adjust historical information to reflect the extent to which we expect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to differ from the conditions that existed for the period over which historical information was evaluated. The primary current and future economic indicators that we use to develop our current estimate of expected losses included the current and forecast U.S. Gross Domestic Product ( GDP\u201d).\nWe calculate the expected credit losses on a pool basis for those trade receivables that have similar risk characteristics. For those trade receivables that do not share similar risk characteristics, the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics relevant to our accounts receivable include revenue billing model and aging status.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for an acquisition and allocate the purchase price to the respective net tangible and intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, and selection of discount rates. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in arriving at fair value measurements in connection with fair values of assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nTransaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred, and are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in our business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations, or a decline in our stock price and market capitalization.\nWe have the option to assess goodwill for possible impairment by performing a qualitative analysis to determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or perform the first step in an impairment test. The first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nWe test for goodwill impairment annually at December 31. At December 31, 2020, we estimated the fair value of our single reporting unit using a market approach, which is based on the market capitalization by using our share price in the NASDAQ Global Market and an appropriate control premium. As our market capitalization without consideration for any control premium was higher than the net book value of our reporting unit, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company experienced a decline in its enterprise market capitalization. Additionally, as a result of the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the Company's announcement that it had entered into a short-term agreement to extend its partnership with USAA Federal Savings Bank to continue to power the USAA Car Buying Service through September 30, 2020, we concluded a triggering event had occurred. In light of these factors, we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020, in which we estimated the fair value of our single reporting unit by utilizing an income approach which uses a discounted cash flow analysis. Given the high degree of market volatility and lack of reliable market data as of March 31, 2020, we determined that the income approach provided the best approximation of fair value. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant assumptions and judgments, which are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy, including the revenue growth rates, workforce cost savings, long-term growth rates and the discount rate. Our assumptions were based on historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit, it is possible that a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if changes in macroeconomic conditions outside the control of management change such that it results in a significant negative impact on our estimated fair value, the fair value of our reporting unit may decrease below its net carrying value, which could result in further impairment of our goodwill.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairment charges recorded on our goodwill. We elected to conduct a quantitative assessment using a market approach, which is based on the market capitalization by using our share price in the NASDAQ Global Market and an appropriate control premium. As our market capitalization without consideration for any control premium exceeded the carrying value, we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets resulting from business combinations, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss equals to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. Fair value is determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows. When measuring the recoverability of these assets, we make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. During the year December 31, 2020, we recorded a ROU asset impairment charge of $2.1 million related to an operating lease. See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairment charges recorded on long-lived assets.\nSoftware and Website Development Costs\nCosts incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages of development and maintenance of our platform are expensed as incurred. Certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a new product or projects to provide significant additional functionality to existing products are capitalized if certain criteria are met. Maintenance and enhancement costs are typically expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are estimated to be three years. Amortization expense is included in depreciation and amortization in the statements of comprehensive loss.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the year that includes the enactment date. We determine deferred tax assets including net operating losses and liabilities, based on temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We have a full valuation allowance, and have concluded, based on the weight of all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized, primarily due to our historical net operating losses.\nWe use a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Step one, recognition, requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, no benefits of the position are recognized. If we determine that a position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, then we proceed to step two, measurement, which is based on the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized on effective settlement. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. If actual results differ from our estimates, our net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be materially impacted.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.", "item_7_truncated": "Pay-Per-Sale. Under the old revenue standard, in years prior to 2018, we recognized revenue for fee arrangements based on a per-vehicle basis when the vehicle sale had occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the Dealer. Under the new revenue standard for fee arrangements based on a pay-per-sale billing model, revenue for the Auto Buying Program is recognized when introductions are delivered to the Dealer and for the amount that the Company estimates it will be able to earn. To formulate this estimate, we use the expected value method based primarily on an analysis of the expected number of sales resulting from in-period introductions. This estimate is based on historical introductions to vehicle sale close rate trends as well as actual sales measured in period. Under the contractual terms and conditions of arrangements with TrueCar Certified Dealers that pay on a per-vehicle-sale basis, the Dealer is not obligated to pay until a vehicle sale has occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the Dealer, for which the introduction was provided by us to the Dealer. Contractually, the Dealers' obligation to pay is not contingent on verification or acceptance of the transaction by the Dealer. As a result, revenue recognition occurs earlier than billing as an estimate of the variable consideration to be received upon control transfer of the delivered introduction, resulting in a contract asset.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Our monetization increased by 5.1% to $352 during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $335 during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to subscription revenue that did not readjust with lower unit volumes as well as increases within newer revenue streams, offset by concessions provided to certain subscription arrangements in the second quarter of 2020. We expect downward pressure on monetization in 2021 as we expect units to outpace rate recapture.\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements, the ALG divestiture met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations.

The CARES Act includes, among other things, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. In addition, on June 29, 2020 California enacted legislation suspending NOL deductions for taxpayers with more than $1 million of business income and imposing limits on the use of tax credits up to $5 million effective for tax years 2020 through 2022. As a result, we plan to utilize California research and development credits to offset California state taxes incurred on the gains from the Divestiture, and thereby diminish our tax assets. We will continue to monitor possible future impact of changes in tax legislation.\nContingent obligations arising from unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the contractual obligations because it is expected that the unrecognized benefits would only result in an insignificant amount of cash payments.\n \nWe benefit consumers by providing information related to what others have paid for a make, model and trim of car in their area and price offers on actual vehicle inventory, which we refer to as VIN-based offers, from our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. VIN-based offers provide consumers with price offers for specific vehicles from specific dealers. We benefit our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers by enabling them to attract these informed, in-market consumers in a cost-effective, accountable manner, which we believe helps them to sell more cars profitably. We benefit OEMs by allowing them to more effectively target their incentive spending at deep-in-market consumers during their purchase process.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues </td> <td>17.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndependent Dealer Count\nBusiness Combinations\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of revenues </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the excluded amount also includes a $2.0 million payment received from one of our insurance carriers in settlement of a lawsuit we brought in the fourth quarter of 2017 to recover insured legal fees. We believe the exclusion of these costs and recovery is appropriate to facilitate comparisons of our core operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Based on the nature of the specific claims underlying the excluded litigation matters, once these matters are resolved, we do not believe our operations are likely to entail defending against the types of claims raised by these matters.\nOur network of TrueCar Certified Dealers consists primarily of new car franchises, representing all major makes of cars, as well as independent dealers selling used vehicles. TrueCar Certified Dealers operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nWe define a monthly unique visitor as an individual who has visited our website, our landing page on our affinity group marketing partner sites, or our mobile applications within a calendar month. We identify unique visitors through cookies for browser-based visits on either a desktop computer or mobile device and through device IDs for mobile application visits. In addition, if a TrueCar.com user logs in, we supplement their identification with their log-in credentials to attempt to avoid double counting on TrueCar.com across devices, browsers and mobile applications. If an individual accesses our service using different devices or different browsers on the same device within a given month, the first access through each such device or browser is counted as a separate monthly unique visitor, except where adjusted based upon TrueCar.com log-in information. We calculate average monthly unique visitors as the sum of the monthly unique visitors in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We view our average monthly unique visitors as a key indicator of the growth in our business and audience reach, the strength of our brand, and the visibility of car-buying services to the member base of our affinity group marketing partners.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions on an ongoing basis and that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

However, we do not adjust our unit metric for these credits as we believe that in most cases a vehicle has in fact been purchased through our platform given the high degree of accuracy of our sales matching process. Credits are most frequently issued to a dealer that claims that it had a pre-existing relationship with a purchaser of a vehicle, and we determine whether we will issue a credit based on a number of factors, including the facts and circumstances related to the dealer claim and the level of claim activity at the dealership. In most cases, we issue credits in order to maintain strong business relations with the dealer and not because we have made an erroneous sales match or billing error.\nFranchise Dealer Count\nAuto Buying Program Add-On Features. We offer additional add-on products to eligible Dealers as part of the Auto Buying Program to increase traffic and retarget in-market consumers. These products include TrueCar Sponsored Listings ( Sponsored Listings\u201d) and TrueCar Reach ( Reach\u201d). Sponsored Listings enables a Dealer to place qualifying vehicles at more prominent positions within the used car search results page. Reach is a service offered to retarget in-market consumers on the Dealer's behalf with co-branded emails. Fees are charged based on a monthly subscription rate for the right to sponsor up to a set number of vehicles at any time throughout the month under Sponsored Listings. Fees for our Reach product are also charged on a flat monthly rate regardless of the number of emails delivered. Subscription fees are recognized on a monthly basis.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\n \nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily consists of interest on our built-to-suit lease financing obligations in years prior to 2019.\n\nQuarterly Key Metrics and Results of Operations\n\n\nWe enter into arrangements with OEMs to promote the sale of their vehicles primarily through the offering of additional consumer incentives. These manufacturers pay us a per-vehicle fee for promotion of the incentive after the sale of the vehicle has occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the dealer. Under the old revenue standard, in years prior to 2018, we recognized as revenue the per-vehicle incentive fee at the time the sale of the vehicle occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the dealer. Under the new revenue standard, our performance obligation to OEMs is to deliver incentive offers to consumers. Control transfers upon delivery of incentive offers, which is the point at which we recognize revenue. We recognize revenue for the amount that we estimate we will be able to earn. To formulate this estimate, we use the expected value method based primarily on an analysis of the expected number of sales resulting from in-period incentive offers delivered. This estimate is based on historical incentive offers to vehicle sales close rate trends as well as delivered incentive offers resulting in actual sales measured in period. As a result, revenue recognition occurs earlier than billing as an estimate of the variable consideration to be received upon control transfer, resulting in a contract asset.\nTechnology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses; third-party contractor fees; facilities costs; software costs; and costs associated with our product development, product management, research and analytics, and internal IT functions.\nDealer. Dealer revenue is comprised of Auto Buying Program revenue as well as revenue from TrueCar Trade and DealerScience. During 2020, we introduced TrueCar Access, which offers dealers our subscription-based package that combines our TrueCar Trade solution and payments solution from DealerScience.\nPresentation of Financial Statements\n\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nRevenues\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations of $121.4 million in 2020 includes net cash provided by operating activities of $9.2 million and cash provided by investing activities of $112.2 million, primarily from cash proceeds received from the sale of ALG. See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWhen a user decides to proceed with a vehicle purchase through us, the user provides his or her name, address, e-mail, and phone number during the process of obtaining price offers on actual vehicle inventory, which gives us the identity and source of a TrueCar introduction provided to a specific Dealer before an actual sale occurs. After a sale occurs, we receive information regarding the sale, including the identity of the purchaser, through the Dealer Management System used by the Dealer that made the sale. We also receive information regarding vehicle sales from a variety of other data sources, including third-party car sales aggregators, car dealer networks, and other publicly available sources (collectively, sales data\u201d) and we use this sales data to further verify that a sale has occurred between an Auto Buying Program user and a TrueCar Certified Dealer, as well as to invoice the Dealer shortly after the completion of the sales transaction. Actual vehicle sales data is reported on a daily basis shortly following the date of sale.\nInterest Expense\nWe also recognize revenue from Dealers under subscription agreements. Subscription fee arrangements are short-term in nature with terms ranging from one to six months and are also cancellable by the Dealer or us at any time. Subscription arrangements fall into three types: flat-rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales ( guaranteed sales\u201d), and subscriptions based on introduction volume, including those subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions ( guaranteed introductions\u201d). For all subscription arrangements, we recognize the fees as revenue when introductions are delivered by allocating a portion of the monthly subscription fee to each delivered introduction. For guaranteed sales and guaranteed introduction subscriptions, the amount allocated is adjusted at the end of each month for any credits, as described below. Total revenue recognized in any given month remains unchanged from the old revenue standard for subscription arrangements.\nAdditionally, we are accelerating our investment in digital automotive retailing as we seek to bring more of the purchasing process online to further support the needs of our dealers and consumers during this challenging and changing environment.\nOther Revenues\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in technology and development expenses of $4.1 million, or 6.9%, for 2019 as compared to 2018 is primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation of $2.3 million, a $0.8 million decrease in professional fees for outsourced services, and a $0.6 million decrease in employee-related expenses due to reduced headcount.\n(6)The excluded amount represents a non-cash impairment charge we recognized on our goodwill during the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\n\nCash used in investing activities of $33.4 million during 2019 resulted primarily from a $23.2 million equity method investment in Accu-Trade as well as $10.2 million of purchases of property and equipment, consisting primarily of $9.8 million of investments in software.\nWe are monitoring the impact of the pandemic on our business and implementing plans to take appropriate actions to adapt to changing circumstances arising from the pandemic. Specifically, we have launched Buy from Home\u201d badge labeling of dealers\nThe number of average monthly unique visitors increased 12.3% to approximately 8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from approximately 7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to improvements to our search engine optimization strategy and a surge in online browsing as a result of COVID-19.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries in accordance with FASB ASC 810 - Consolidation. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\ntax liabilities. The benefit from income taxes for 2019 of $1.3 million primarily reflects a tax benefit associated with the intraperiod tax allocation required by ASC 740. The benefit from income taxes for 2018 of $1.2 million primarily reflects a tax benefit associated with the intraperiod tax allocation required by ASC 740.\nSet forth below is information concerning our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses of $75.1 million, or 33.1%, for 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflected a $30.2 million decrease in partner marketing and revenue share paid to affinity marketing partners, a $23.4 million decrease in branded media spend, and a $10.5 million decrease, net of severance costs, in salaries and employee-related expenses due to reduced headcount following the restructuring undertaken in the second quarter of 2020. Further decreases include a $6.3 million decline in conference and travel-related expenses and a $4.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation.\n\nUnits\nAuto Buying Program revenue consists of fees paid by dealers participating in our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. Dealers pay us these fees on a per-vehicle basis for sales to our users, on a per-introduction basis for sales to our users or in the form of a subscription arrangement. Subscription arrangements fall into several types: flat-rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales, which we refer to as guaranteed-sales subscriptions, and subscriptions based on introduction volume, including those subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions, which we refer to as guaranteed-introductions subscriptions. Additionally, certain dealers pay an incremental subscription fee for add-on products within our Auto Buying Program.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur revenues are comprised primarily of dealer revenue and OEM incentives revenue. We recognize transaction revenue for certain of our Auto Buying Program and OEM incentives arrangements at the time introductions and incentives are delivered based upon expected subsequent vehicle sales between the Auto Buying Program user and the dealer.\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make operating and strategic decisions.\nWe adopted the new revenue standard as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The updated standard replaces all pre-existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with prior revenue guidance.\n(2) Purchase obligations include long-term agreements to purchase data information, software related licenses and support services, and other obligations that are enforceable and legally binding as of December 31, 2020. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.\nWe define independent dealer count as the number of independent dealers in the network of TrueCar Certified Dealers who participate in our Auto Buying Program at the end of a given period that exclusively sell used vehicles and are not directly affiliated with a new car manufacturer. This number is calculated by counting each location, or rooftop, individually, regardless of the size of the dealership that owns the rooftop. Our independent dealer count decreased to 3,794 at December 31, 2020 from 4,395 at December 31, 2019 and from 3,655 at December 31, 2018. The decline in independent dealer count was primarily due to suspensions, cancellations or going-out-of-business due to COVID-19. We expect our independent dealer count to continue to fluctuate due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOEM Incentives. OEM incentives revenue consists of fees paid by automobile manufacturers, or OEMs, to promote the sale of their vehicles through the offering of additional consumer incentives to members of our affinity group marketing partners. These OEMs pay us a subscription or per-vehicle fee for promotion of the incentive.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in sales and marketing expenses of $15.8 million, or 7.5%, for 2019 as compared to 2018 reflected a $6.9 million increase in salaries and employee-related expenses, a $5.1 million increase in branded media spend, a $3.0 million increase in partner marketing and revenue share paid to affinity marketing partners, a $1.1 increase in facilities costs, a $0.8 million increase in creative production costs, and a $0.7 million increase in professional fees for outsourced services. These increases were partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a $0.5 million decrease in conference and travel-related expense and a $0.4 million decrease in marketing and other expenses.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included herein. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere herein. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nGoodwill Impairment\n(3) Contingent consideration as part of the DealerScience acquisition relates to the second earnout payment presented at its fair value. The undiscounted earnout payment of $2.5 million for DealerScience is due in 2021.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:\n\nOur net loss and cash flows used in operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support our growth, and marketing and advertising expenses. We have experienced positive operating cash flows despite having experienced a net loss due to the inclusion of non-cash expenses and charges.\n(1)We issued full credits of the amount originally invoiced with respect to 17,655, 21,201, and 23,885 units during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As discussed in the description of the units metric below, we have not adjusted the number of units downward to reflect these credited units.\nWe recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\nDealerScience. DealerScience revenues consist of monthly subscription fees paid by dealers for access to DealerScience's products and services. DealerScience provides dealers with advanced digital retailing software tools that allow them to calculate accurate monthly payments, expedite vehicle desking, which is the process of presenting and agreeing upon financial terms and financing options, and streamline the consumers' experience from shopping to showroom. Dealers pay monthly subscription fees for access to the software. Subscription fees are recognized on a monthly basis.\nThe following tables set forth selected key metrics and unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data for each of the quarters indicated. The consolidated financial statements for each of these quarters have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the consolidated results of operations for these periods. You should read this information together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.\n(1)The excluded amounts include stock-based compensation of $7.2 million incurred in the second quarter of 2019 associated with the acceleration of certain equity awards and the extension of the exercise period for certain vested stock options related to the departures of certain executives, including our former chief executive officer.\nOur franchise dealer count decreased to 10,589 at December 31, 2020 from 12,565 at December 31, 2019 and from 12,674 at December 31, 2018. The decline in franchise dealer count was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as government authorities imposed restrictions on retail activity and a number of dealers opting to suspend their marketing spend to preserve their profitability during times of economic uncertainty. We expect our franchise dealer count to continue to fluctuate due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the termination of our partnership with USAA Federal Savings Bank.\nTrueCar is a leading automotive digital marketplace that enables car buyers to connect to our network of Certified Dealers. We are building the industry's most personalized and efficient car buying experience as we seek to bring more of the purchasing process online.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of television, digital, and radio advertising; media production costs; affinity group partner marketing fees, which also include loan subvention costs where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of consumers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners; common stock warrants issued to USAA; marketing sponsorship programs; and digital customer acquisition. See Part III, Item 13 Certain Relationships, Related Party and Other Transactions - Strategic Partnerships - United Services Automobile Association\u201d for a description of our previous arrangements with USAA. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include employee-related expenses for sales, customer support, marketing and public relations employees, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses; third-party contractor fees; and facilities costs. Marketing and advertising costs promote our services and are expensed as incurred, except for media production costs, which are expensed the first time the advertisement is aired.\nFinally, our former ALG subsidiary provided forecasts and consulting services regarding determination of the residual value of an automobile at given future points in time. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition, financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease, and fleet portfolios. On November 30, 2020, we divested ALG to J.D. Power. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further details.\n* Less than 0.5% of revenues\nThe following table summarizes net cash derived from operating, investing, and financing activities from continuing operations, as well as net cash from discontinued operations:\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income decreased $2.0 million, or 81.4%, for 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates.\nWe define franchise dealer count as the number of franchise dealers in the network of TrueCar Certified Dealers who participate in our Auto Buying Program at the end of a given period. This number is calculated by counting the number of brands of new cars sold at each individual location, or rooftop, regardless of the size of the dealership that owns the rooftop. The network is comprised of dealers with a range of unit sales volume per dealer, with dealers representing certain brands consistently achieving higher than average unit sales volume. We view our ability to increase our franchise dealer count, particularly dealers representing high volume brands, as an indicator of our market penetration and the likelihood of converting users of our platform into unit sales. Our TrueCar Certified Dealer network includes independent non-franchised dealers that primarily sell used cars and are not included in franchise dealer count.\nOther Income. Other income primarily consists of fees earned associated with the transition services agreement with J.D. Power as a result of our ALG divestiture.\nWe test for goodwill impairment annually at December 31. At December 31, 2020, we estimated the fair value of our single reporting unit using a market approach, which is based on the market capitalization by using our share price in the NASDAQ Global Market and an appropriate control premium. As our market capitalization without consideration for any control premium was higher than the net book value of our reporting unit, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other income consists of fees earned from the transition services agreement associated with the divestiture of ALG.\nrevenues for 2019 as compared to 90.9%, 9.0%, and 0.1%, respectively, of revenues for 2018. The increase of $13.4 million in dealer revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected a 0.6% increase in monetization, along with increases within newer revenue streams of $9.2 million primarily due to our Trade and DealerScience products as well as an increase of $4.2 million due to growth in used car sales in 2019. The decrease of $13.4 million in OEM incentive revenue was primarily due to the lack of recurring revenue from a large OEM client and softness in our existing clients in 2019. Other revenue for 2019 remained materially consistent as compared to 2018.\n \nResults of Operations\nFlat-Rate Subscription. Under flat-rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of introductions provided by us to the Dealer or sales made to users of our platform by the Dealer.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses for executive, finance, accounting, legal, and human resources functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal, accounting, and other third-party professional service fees, bad debt, lease exit costs, and facilities costs.\n(4)The excluded amounts represent charges associated with the restructuring plans undertaken in the second quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2019 to improve efficiency and reduce expenses. We believe excluding the impact of these charges is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of our ongoing operating results.\nOur performance obligation to TrueCar Certified Dealers is the same for all payment types for our Auto Buying Program revenues: to provide Dealers with introductions to in-market consumers through the use of the TrueCar platform, so that those Dealers have the opportunity to sell vehicles to those consumers. Control transfers to Dealers upon delivery of introductions, which is the point at which we recognize revenue.\nWe have experienced significant disruptions since the outbreak was declared a pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted our results of operations as reflected in the year over year decline in revenues and could further impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity and duration of the outbreak, actions taken by government authorities, economic uncertainty, the increasing number of consumers who are unemployed, and vehicle inventory shortages caused by closures in OEM production facilities. Our future results of operations and liquidity could be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms and concessions that we may provide to our customers. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional disclosures of risks related to COVID-19.\n(1) Lease obligations consist of various leases for office space and have not been reduced by minimum non-cancelable sublease rentals aggregating $1.5 million.\nWe do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, as part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. General and administrative expenses decreased $14.3 million, or 22.3%, for 2020 as compared to 2019. The decrease is primarily due to a $8.1 million decrease in costs for consulting and outsourced services, a $4.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a $3.0 million decrease in employee-related expenses due to decreased headcount following the restructuring undertaken in the second quarter of 2020, and a $1.2 million decrease in conference and travel-related expenses. These decreases were offset by a $2.1 million impairment charge on our right-of-use asset associated with an office lease and a $1.5 million increase in bad debt expense driven by an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts due in part to the impact of COVID-19.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $12.8 million. This was primarily due to a loss from continuing operations of $58.3 million, which adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense of $36.5 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $20.7 million and amortization of lease right-of-use assets of $5.9 million. Net cash provided by operation activities also included a $3.7 million increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $3.7 million increase primarily reflected an increase of $10.5 in accrued expenses and other current liabilities mainly driven by accrued marketing costs and a $4.0 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of cash collections, offset by a $6.8 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a $4.9 million decrease in accounts payable.\nTrueCar Trade revenue consists of dealers who pay monthly subscription fees that vary depending on the level of trade service selected. Depending on their subscription terms, some dealers pay additional transaction fees for each vehicle purchased from a consumer that was introduced via TrueCar Trade.\n \nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. We provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, as it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result of the valuation allowance, our income tax benefit (or expense) is significantly less than the federal statutory rate of 21%. Our benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily arose in connection with the impairment of goodwill, resulting in reduction of indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities. Our benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflects a tax benefit associated with the intraperiod allocation required by ASC 740.\nIn years prior to 2020, we determined our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical write-off experience and specific circumstances that make it likely that recovery will not occur. We reviewed the allowance for doubtful accounts periodically and assessed the aging of account balances, with an emphasis on those that are past due over ninety days. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.\n(3)The excluded amounts include $4.6 million in executive severance costs, as well as related recruiting fees of $0.5 million, associated with the separation of our former chief executive officer and the termination of executive-level employees in connection with the change in chief executive officer in the second quarter of 2019. We believe excluding the impact of these terminations and the associated chief executive officer recruiting fees is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of our ongoing operating results.\noffering such solutions designed to help consumers and dealers safely and remotely navigate car buying in response to social distancing guidelines during COVID-19. Dealers badged with Buy from Home\u201d on the TrueCar platform offer the following features:\nTechnology and Development Expenses\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.\n(9)Non-GAAP net income (loss) is not a measure of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For a definition of Non-GAAP net income (loss) see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nDealerScience revenue consists of monthly subscription fees paid by dealers for access to the DealerScience products and services. DealerScience provides dealers with advanced digital retailing software tools that allow them to calculate accurate monthly payments, expedite vehicle desking, which is the process of presenting and agreeing upon financial terms and financing options, and streamline the consumers' experience from shopping to showroom.\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of $278.7 million and recorded a net income of $76.5 million, which comprised of $96.4 million income from discontinued operations offset by $19.8 million loss from continuing operations.\nWe report our financial results as one operating segment, with three distinct service offerings: Dealer products and services, OEM incentives, and other. Our operating results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker on a consolidated basis, principally to make decisions about how we allocate our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance. Our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews revenue for each of our dealer, OEM incentives and other offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the factors driving our business.\n\nWe have established a diverse software ecosystem on a common technology infrastructure, powered by proprietary data and analytics. Our company-branded platform is available on our TrueCar website and mobile applications. In addition, we customize and operate our platform on a co-branded basis for our many affinity group marketing partners, including financial institutions like PenFed and American Express; membership-based organizations like Consumer Reports, AARP, Sam's Club, and AAA; and employee buying programs for large enterprises such as IBM and Walmart. We enable users to obtain market-based pricing data on new and used cars, and to connect with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We also allow automobile manufacturers, known in the industry as OEMs, to connect with TrueCar users during the purchase process and efficiently deliver targeted incentives to consumers.\nShare Repurchase Program\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\nCash used in financing activities of $0.5 million for 2019 reflects taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards of $3.3 million, offset by $2.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\n\nKey Metrics\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGuaranteed-Introductions Subscription. Under guaranteed-introductions subscription arrangements, monthly fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the Dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the Dealer. If the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees.\nOverview\nCash used in financing activities of $49.2 million during 2020 primarily represents payments of $42.8 million for the repurchase of our common stock, taxes paid of $4.3 million for the net shares settlement of equity awards, and a $2.3 million payment related to the fair value portion of a contingent consideration related to our 2018 acquisition of DealerScience.\n\n\u2022Home vehicle delivery\n(1)We issued full credits of the amount originally invoiced with respect to 4,505, 4,790, 2,847, 5,513, 5,423, 6,100, 3,985 and 5,693 units during the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019, and March 31, 2019, respectively. The number of units has not been adjusted downward to reflect units credited.\nDeferred revenue is recognized on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets when payments are received in advance of us meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria described above.\nCash used in investing activities of $42.2 million during 2018 resulted primarily from $26.9 million of cash paid for the acquisition of DealerScience and $16.1 million of purchases of property and equipment, consisting primary of $12.5 million of investments in software.\nGuaranteed-Sales Subscription. Under guaranteed-sales subscription arrangements, monthly fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the Dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the Dealer. If the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. As of January 1, 2019, we no longer offer guaranteed sales subscription arrangements in California, and we transferred all California dealers from this billing method to flat-rate subscription arrangements before that date.\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations of $7.8 million in 2018 includes net cash provided by operating activities of $8.8 million, offset by cash used in investing activities of $1.0 million for purchases of property and equipment.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. General and administrative expenses increased $11.6 million, or 21.9%, for 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase is primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to $3.2 million in severance costs associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer in the second quarter of 2019, a $3.4 million increase in stock-based compensation primarily due to the acceleration of certain equity awards and the extension of the exercise period for certain vested stock options provided to our former chief executive officer, a $2.2 million increase in costs for consulting and outsourced services, and a $1.0 million increase in overhead and facilities costs.\nNet Cash Provided by Discontinued Operations\nRevenues\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, sales allowances and allowances for doubtful accounts, the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, the recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, income taxes, and the expensing and capitalization of software and website development costs have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nWe have incurred cumulative losses of $355.5 million from our operations through December 31, 2020, and expect to incur additional losses in the future. We are continuously monitoring our liquidity and anticipated capital requirements in light of the significant uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue levels, the timing and extent of our spending to support our technology and development efforts, costs related to potential acquisitions to further expand our business and product offerings, collection of accounts receivable, macroeconomic activity, and the length and severity of business disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents, and cash from operations, are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\nOther revenues in the past have been immaterial. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other revenues primarily consists of fees earned related to the USAA transition services agreement that terminated on September 30, 2020.\nWe use a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Step one, recognition, requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, no benefits of the position are recognized. If we determine that a position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, then we proceed to step two, measurement, which is based on the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized on effective settlement. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. If actual results differ from our estimates, our net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be materially impacted.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $273.3 million.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus, a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and the world. This has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including quarantines, shelter-in-place\u201d and stay-at-home\u201d orders, travel restrictions, and temporary closures of non-essential businesses. We have taken proactive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers by closing our offices, requiring employees to work from home and suspending travel, in-person meetings and visits with our customers. We expect to continue these measures until the pandemic is adequately contained as determined by authorities.\n\nCapitalized software costs decreased $2.7 million for 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in third-party software of $1.9 million and a decrease in the amount of internally-developed software of $0.8 million.\nCapitalized software costs decreased $0.6 million for 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in the amount of internally-developed software of $0.9 million offset by an increase in third-party software of $0.4 million.\nWe calculate the expected credit losses on a pool basis for those trade receivables that have similar risk characteristics. For those trade receivables that do not share similar risk characteristics, the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics relevant to our accounts receivable include revenue billing model and aging status.\n(7)The excluded amount represents an impairment charge on our ROU assets associated with certain of our existing office locations. We consider these charges to be unrelated to our underlying results of operations and believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons.\n\u2022Remote paperwork processing\n\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Non-GAAP net (loss) income for each of the periods presented:\nInterest Income\nThe results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nAverage Monthly Unique Visitors\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the year that includes the enactment date. We determine deferred tax assets including net operating losses and liabilities, based on temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We have a full valuation allowance, and have concluded, based on the weight of all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized, primarily due to our historical net operating losses.\nThe number of units decreased 23.2% to 766,413 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 998,495 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The unit decrease is primarily due to COVID-19, which was declared by the World Health Organization as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, as well as the wind-down of our partnership with USAA that ended on September 30, 2020. With COVID-19, social distancing was encouraged with many government authorities issuing shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders, the closing of non-essential businesses, and temporary shutdowns of OEM production facilities. In 2021, we expect total units to be impacted by the continued effects of COVID-19 as well as the termination of the USAA partnership.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets resulting from business combinations, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss equals to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. Fair value is determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows. When measuring the recoverability of these assets, we make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. During the year December 31, 2020, we recorded a ROU asset impairment charge of $2.1 million related to an operating lease. See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairment charges recorded on long-lived assets.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in our business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations, or a decline in our stock price and market capitalization.\nCash provided by financing activities of $16.7 million for 2018 reflects $19.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards of $3.0 million.\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting guidance on measuring credit losses on our trade accounts receivable. The new credit loss guidance replaces the old model for measuring the allowance for credit losses with a model that is based on the expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new credit loss model, lifetime expected credit losses are measured and recognized at each reporting date based on historical, current and forecast information.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in our revenues of $56.4 million, or 16.8%, in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflected a decrease in our dealer revenue offset by an increase in other revenue. Dealer revenue, OEM incentives revenue, and other revenue comprised 90.8%, 6.0%, and 3.2%, respectively, of revenues for 2020 as compared to 94.9%, 4.9%, and 0.2%, respectively, for 2019. The decrease of $65.0 million in dealer revenue for 2020 reflected a decrease in our Auto Buying Program revenue of $65.8 million primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and concessions we provided to certain subscription arrangements as well as the wind-down of our partnership with USAA, offset by increases within newer revenue streams of $0.8 million. These decreases were offset by an increase of $8.4 million in other revenue primarily driven by fees earned related to the USAA transition services agreement for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods indicated.\nPay-Per-Introduction. Under fee arrangements based on a pay-per-introduction billing model, revenue for the Auto Buying Program is recognized when introductions are delivered.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nCash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $16.1 million. This was primarily due to a loss from continuing operations of $31.7 million, which adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense of $35.6 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $17.8 million. Net cash provided by operating activities also included a $7.7 million decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $7.7 million decrease primarily reflected a $9.0 million decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of cash collections, a $3.6 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to an increase in prepaid marketing costs, offset by a $7.5 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to an increase in marketing fees payable to our affinity group partners and advertisers.\n \nUnder the new guidance, we consider the need to adjust historical information to reflect the extent to which we expect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to differ from the conditions that existed for the period over which historical information was evaluated. The primary current and future economic indicators that we use to develop our current estimate of expected losses included the current and forecast U.S. Gross Domestic Product ( GDP\u201d).\n(8)For periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, there was no income tax impact related to the adjustments made to calculate Non-GAAP net (loss) income because of our available net operating loss carryforwards and the full valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company experienced a decline in its enterprise market capitalization. Additionally, as a result of the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the Company's announcement that it had entered into a short-term agreement to extend its partnership with USAA Federal Savings Bank to continue to power the USAA Car Buying Service through September 30, 2020, we concluded a triggering event had occurred. In light of these factors, we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020, in which we estimated the fair value of our single reporting unit by utilizing an income approach which uses a discounted cash flow analysis. Given the high degree of market volatility and lack of reliable market data as of March 31, 2020, we determined that the income approach provided the best approximation of fair value. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant assumptions and judgments, which are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy, including the revenue growth rates, workforce cost savings, long-term growth rates and the discount rate. Our assumptions were based on historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit, it is possible that a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if changes in macroeconomic conditions outside the control of management change such that it results in a significant negative impact on our estimated fair value, the fair value of our reporting unit may decrease below its net carrying value, which could result in further impairment of our goodwill.\n\nWe have the option to assess goodwill for possible impairment by performing a qualitative analysis to determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or perform the first step in an impairment test. The first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. Interest income decreased $0.3 million, or 11.1%, for 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to lower interest rates.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $2.9 million, or 16.1%, for 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase is primarily due to a $2.4 million increase related to intangible assets acquired from the acquisition of DealerScience in December 2018 and a $0.6 million net increase associated with the reclassification of certain build-to-suit assets to leasehold improvements upon adoption of the new lease guidance in January 2019.\nSoftware and Website Development Costs\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our board of directors authorized an open market stock repurchase program (the Program\u201d) of up to $75 million to allow for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through September 30, 2022. The timing and amount of any repurchases is determined by us based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Repurchases of our common stock may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws, open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate us to purchase any minimum number of shares. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased and retired a total of 9.3 million shares under the Program for $42.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, we have a remaining authorization of $32.8 million for future share repurchases.\nCertain of our subscription arrangements are charged based on volume of introductions provided while other introduction-based subscription arrangements operate under a guaranteed-introductions model. Under guaranteed-introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the dealer. If the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, increased $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a gain on sale of $92.5 million recognized on the ALG divestiture. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for more information.\nMonetization\n(7)The excluded amount represents an impairment charge on our ROU assets associated with certain of our existing office locations. We consider these charges to be unrelated to our underlying results of operations and believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cost of revenue of $6.3 million, or 22.6%, for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to a $2.6 million decrease in data and licensing costs, a $1.8 million decrease in employee-related costs related to reduced headcount following the restructuring undertaken in the second quarter of 2020, a $0.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation, and a $0.6 million decrease in conference and travel-related expenses.\n(8)Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nInvesting Activities of Continuing Operations\n(2)Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) are not measures of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income (loss), or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss), see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nInterest Income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nContractual Obligations\nOur subsidiary, TCDS, provides our TrueCar Trade and Payments products. Our Trade solution gives consumers information on the value of their trade-in vehicles and enables them to obtain a guaranteed trade-in price before setting foot in the dealership. This valuation is, in turn, backed by a third-party guarantee to dealers that the vehicles will be repurchased at the indicated price if the dealer does not want to keep them. Our Payments solution leverages the digital retailing technology of our DealerScience subsidiary, acquired in December 2018, to help consumers calculate accurate monthly payments.\nWe are party to a credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank that provides for advances of up to $35.0 million. This credit facility provides a $10.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit and contains an increase option permitting us, subject to the lender's consent, to increase the revolving credit facility by up to $15.0 million, to an aggregate maximum of $50.0 million. The credit facility has a three-year term and matures on February 18, 2021. Prior to the expiration of the credit facility, we extended the maturity date to April 19, 2021. No amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2020. The amount available under the credit facility at December 31, 2020 was $32.2 million, reduced for the letters of credit issued and outstanding under the subfacility of $2.8 million. See Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements herein for more information about our amended credit facility.\n\u2022Verified vehicle sanitization\nIncome from Discontinued Operations\n(2)The excluded amounts relate to legal costs incurred in connection with complaints filed by non-TrueCar dealers against TrueCar and consumer class action lawsuits. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the excluded amount also includes a $2.0 million payment received from one of our insurance carriers in settlement of a lawsuit we brought in the fourth quarter of 2017 to recover insured legal fees. We believe the exclusion of these costs and recovery is appropriate to facilitate comparisons of our core operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Based on the nature of the specific claims underlying the excluded litigation matters, once these matters are resolved, we do not believe our operations are likely to entail defending against the types of claims raised by these matters.\nYears ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The benefit from income taxes for 2020 of less than $0.1 million primarily arose in connection with the impairment of goodwill, resulting in reduction of indefinite-lived deferred\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n \n(3)The excluded amounts include $4.6 million in executive severance costs, as well as related recruiting fees of $0.5 million, associated with the separation of our former chief executive officer and the termination of executive-level employees in connection with the change in chief executive officer in the second quarter of 2019. We believe excluding the impact of these terminations and the associated chief executive officer recruiting fees is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of our ongoing operating results.\nGoodwill\nOther Income\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in technology and development expenses of $11.2 million, or 19.9%, for 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflected a $6.2 million decrease, net of severance costs, in salaries and employee-related expenses due to reduced headcount following the restructuring undertaken in the second quarter of 2020, a $3.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation, and a $1.2 million decrease in conference and travel-related expenses.\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations of $6.4 million in 2019 includes net cash provided by operating activities of $7.5 million, offset by cash used in investing activities of $1.1 million for purchases of property and equipment.\nWe offer additional add-on products to eligible dealers as part of the Auto Buying Program to increase traffic and retarget in-market consumers. These products include TrueCar Sponsored Listings and TrueCar Reach. TrueCar Sponsor Listings enables a\nSee Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements included herein for more information about our provision for income taxes.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for an acquisition and allocate the purchase price to the respective net tangible and intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, and selection of discount rates. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in arriving at fair value measurements in connection with fair values of assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Cost of revenue includes expenses related to the fulfillment of our services, consisting primarily of data costs and licensing fees paid to third-party service providers and expenses related to operating our website and mobile applications, including data center costs; hosting fees; data processing costs required to deliver introductions to our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers; employee costs related to certain dealer operations and sales matching; and facilities costs. Cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization of software costs and other hosting and data infrastructure equipment used to operate our platforms, which are included in the depreciation and amortization line item on our statements of comprehensive loss.\nOEM Incentives Revenue\nWe define units as the number of automobiles purchased from TrueCar Certified Dealers that are matched to users of TrueCar.com, our TrueCar-branded mobile applications or the car-buying sites and mobile applications we maintain for our affinity group marketing partners. A unit is counted after we have matched the sale to a TrueCar user with one of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We view units as a key indicator of the health of our business, the effectiveness of our product and the size and geographic coverage of our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nUnder guaranteed-sales subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the dealer. If the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. As of January 1, 2019, we no longer offer guaranteed sales subscription arrangements in California, and we transferred all California dealers from this billing method to flat-rate subscription arrangements before that date.\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.\nUnder flat-rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of introductions made to users of our platform by the dealer.\nComponents of Operating Results\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairment charges recorded on our goodwill. We elected to conduct a quantitative assessment using a market approach, which is based on the market capitalization by using our share price in the NASDAQ Global Market and an appropriate control premium. As our market capitalization without consideration for any control premium exceeded the carrying value, we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nOperating Activities of Continuing Operations\nOur Auto Buying Program revenue includes fees paid by customers participating in the Company's dealer network with which the Company has an agreement ( TrueCar Certified Dealers\u201d or Dealers\u201d). TrueCar Certified Dealers pay us fees in one of three ways: on a per-vehicle basis for sales to Auto Buying Program users, on a per-introduction basis for sales to Auto Buying Program users or under a subscription arrangement. Additionally, certain Dealers pay an incremental subscription fee for add-on products within our Auto Buying Program. Contracts are cancellable by the Dealer or us at any time. We do not provide significant dealer financing terms.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense decreased $2.6 million to zero in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to our exit from our San Francisco leased office space as of December 31, 2018, and with the adoption of the new leasing standard and the de-recognition of our lease financing obligation for our Santa Monica leased office space.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts\nWe had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $269.2 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $215.1 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, we also had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $13.0 million and $10.2 million, respectively. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code impose substantial restrictions on the use of net operating losses and other tax attributes in the event of a cumulative ownership change\u201d of a corporation of more than 50% over a three-year period. We experienced a cumulative ownership change as of December 31, 2019 within the meanings of Sections 382 and 383. During the second quarter of 2020, we estimated that up to $86.8 million and $2.5 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, may expire unused. This limitation resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets of $18.4 million and was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance, with no net tax provision impact. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our Section 382 and 383 limitation to account for the divestiture of ALG's net assets. We estimate that up to $15.2 million and $0.5 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, may expire unused. The Section 382 limitation resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets of $3.2 million and was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance, with no net tax provision impact. Additionally, pending finalization of the 2011-2020 research and development tax credit study, we anticipate that certain federal research and development credit carryforwards may expire unused.\nCosts incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages of development and maintenance of our platform are expensed as incurred. Certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a new product or projects to provide significant additional functionality to existing products are capitalized if certain criteria are met. Maintenance and enhancement costs are typically expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are estimated to be three years. Amortization expense is included in depreciation and amortization in the statements of comprehensive loss.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2020 was $29.9 million. This was primarily due to a loss from continuing operations of $19.8 million, which adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense of $23.1 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $20.4 million, goodwill impairment of $8.3 million, amortization of lease right-of-use assets of $5.4 million, bad debt expense of $3.0 million, and asset impairment and write-off of $2.4 million primarily due to a ROU asset impairment of $2.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities also included a $14.2 million decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $14.2 million decrease primarily reflected a decrease of $8.2 million in accounts payable primarily due to a decrease in marketing fees payable to our affinity group partners and advertisers, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $6.3 million and a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.1 million driven by reduced accrued legal fees, offset by an increase of $2.3 million in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of cash collections, an increase of $1.3 million in prepaid expense and other assets primarily due to a decrease in prepaid marketing costs.\nOur investing activities consist primarily of cash paid for equity method investment, the acquisition of DealerScience and capital expenditures for capitalized software development costs and property and equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of $8.3 million, which represents the amount that our carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value at March 31, 2020. For further details, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code impose substantial restrictions on the use of net operating losses and other tax attributes in the event of a cumulative ownership change\u201d of a corporation of more than 50% over a three-year period. We experienced a cumulative ownership change as of December 31, 2019 within the meanings of Sections 382 and 383.

Additionally, pending finalization of the 2011-2020 research and development tax credit study, we anticipate that certain federal research and development credit carryforwards may expire unused.\nFor guaranteed-sales and guaranteed-introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of sales generated or introductions delivered through our platform during the subscription period multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction or (ii) the guaranteed number of sales or introductions multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction.", "item_7_text": "Pay-Per-Sale. Under the old revenue standard, in years prior to 2018, we recognized revenue for fee arrangements based on a per-vehicle basis when the vehicle sale had occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the Dealer. Under the new revenue standard for fee arrangements based on a pay-per-sale billing model, revenue for the Auto Buying Program is recognized when introductions are delivered to the Dealer and for the amount that the Company estimates it will be able to earn. To formulate this estimate, we use the expected value method based primarily on an analysis of the expected number of sales resulting from in-period introductions. This estimate is based on historical introductions to vehicle sale close rate trends as well as actual sales measured in period. Under the contractual terms and conditions of arrangements with TrueCar Certified Dealers that pay on a per-vehicle-sale basis, the Dealer is not obligated to pay until a vehicle sale has occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the Dealer, for which the introduction was provided by us to the Dealer. Contractually, the Dealers' obligation to pay is not contingent on verification or acceptance of the transaction by the Dealer. As a result, revenue recognition occurs earlier than billing as an estimate of the variable consideration to be received upon control transfer of the delivered introduction, resulting in a contract asset.\nRevenue Recognition\n\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue remained flat in 2019 as compared to 2018. Dealer revenue, OEM incentives revenue, and other revenue comprised 94.9%, 4.9%, and 0.2%, respectively, of\nWe define monetization as the average transaction revenue per unit, which we calculate by dividing all of our transaction revenue (dealer revenue and OEM incentives revenue) in a given period by the number of units in that period. Our monetization increased by 5.1% to $352 during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $335 during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to subscription revenue that did not readjust with lower unit volumes as well as increases within newer revenue streams, offset by concessions provided to certain subscription arrangements in the second quarter of 2020. We expect downward pressure on monetization in 2021 as we expect units to outpace rate recapture.\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements, the ALG divestiture met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Therefore, we are reporting the historical results of ALG, including the results of operations, cash flows, and related assets and liabilities, as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligation or obligations are satisfied.\nTrueCar Trade. TrueCar Trade provides consumers with information on the value of their trade-in vehicles, while providing Dealers with introductions to these in-market consumers so that those Dealers have the opportunity to buy trade-in vehicles from those consumers. Dealers pay monthly subscription fees for access to TrueCar Trade that vary depending on the level of service selected. Depending on their subscription terms, some dealers pay additional transaction fees for each vehicle purchased from a consumer that was introduced through TrueCar Trade. Subscription fees are recognized on a monthly basis, while transaction fees for vehicles purchased by a Dealer are estimated and recognized at the point in time the introduction between the dealer and consumer occurs.\nContractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements\nCash Flows\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation consists primarily of depreciation expense recorded on property and equipment. Amortization expense consists primarily of amortization recorded on intangible assets, capitalized software costs, and leasehold improvements.\nCredit Facility\nDealer revenue is comprised of Auto Buying Program revenue as well as revenue from TrueCar Trade and DealerScience. During 2020, we introduced TrueCar Access, which offers dealers our subscription-based package product offerings that combine our TrueCar Trade solution and payments solution from DealerScience.\nCash used in investing activities of $10.3 million during 2020 was for purchases of property and equipment, consisting primary of $9.1 million of investments in software.\nFinancing Activities of Continuing Operations\n(5)The excluded amounts represent external legal, accounting, consulting and other third-party fees and costs we incurred in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisition transactions. These expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. We consider these fees and costs, which are associated with potential merger and acquisition transactions outside the normal course of our operations, to be unrelated to our underlying results of operations and believe that their exclusion provides investors with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business operations.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. Net income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(5)The excluded amounts represent external legal, accounting, consulting and other third-party fees and costs we incurred in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisition transactions. These expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. We consider these fees and costs, which are associated with potential merger and acquisition transactions outside the normal course of our operations, to be unrelated to our underlying results of operations and believe that their exclusion provides investors with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business operations.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses facing economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency. The CARES Act includes, among other things, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. In addition, on June 29, 2020 California enacted legislation suspending NOL deductions for taxpayers with more than $1 million of business income and imposing limits on the use of tax credits up to $5 million effective for tax years 2020 through 2022. As a result, we plan to utilize California research and development credits to offset California state taxes incurred on the gains from the Divestiture, and thereby diminish our tax assets. We will continue to monitor possible future impact of changes in tax legislation.\nContingent obligations arising from unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the contractual obligations because it is expected that the unrecognized benefits would only result in an insignificant amount of cash payments.\n \nWe benefit consumers by providing information related to what others have paid for a make, model and trim of car in their area and price offers on actual vehicle inventory, which we refer to as VIN-based offers, from our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. VIN-based offers provide consumers with price offers for specific vehicles from specific dealers. We benefit our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers by enabling them to attract these informed, in-market consumers in a cost-effective, accountable manner, which we believe helps them to sell more cars profitably. We benefit OEMs by allowing them to more effectively target their incentive spending at deep-in-market consumers during their purchase process.\nIndependent Dealer Count\nBusiness Combinations\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cost of revenue of $1.7 million, or 6.5%, for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in data and licensing costs, a $0.7 million increase in employee-related costs, and a $0.3 million increase in stock-based compensation.\n(4)The excluded amounts represent charges associated with the restructuring plans undertaken in the second quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2019 to improve efficiency and reduce expenses. We believe excluding the impact of these charges is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of our ongoing operating results.\n(6)The excluded amount represents a non-cash impairment charge we recognized on our goodwill during the first quarter of 2020.\n(1)The excluded amounts include stock-based compensation of $7.2 million incurred in the second quarter of 2019 associated with the acceleration of certain equity awards and the extension of the exercise period for certain vested stock options related to the departures of certain executives, including our former chief executive officer.\nOther Revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of fees earned associated with the USAA transition services agreement for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2)The excluded amounts relate to legal costs incurred in connection with complaints filed by non-TrueCar dealers against TrueCar and consumer class action lawsuits. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the excluded amount also includes a $2.0 million payment received from one of our insurance carriers in settlement of a lawsuit we brought in the fourth quarter of 2017 to recover insured legal fees. We believe the exclusion of these costs and recovery is appropriate to facilitate comparisons of our core operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Based on the nature of the specific claims underlying the excluded litigation matters, once these matters are resolved, we do not believe our operations are likely to entail defending against the types of claims raised by these matters.\nOur network of TrueCar Certified Dealers consists primarily of new car franchises, representing all major makes of cars, as well as independent dealers selling used vehicles. TrueCar Certified Dealers operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nWe define a monthly unique visitor as an individual who has visited our website, our landing page on our affinity group marketing partner sites, or our mobile applications within a calendar month. We identify unique visitors through cookies for browser-based visits on either a desktop computer or mobile device and through device IDs for mobile application visits. In addition, if a TrueCar.com user logs in, we supplement their identification with their log-in credentials to attempt to avoid double counting on TrueCar.com across devices, browsers and mobile applications. If an individual accesses our service using different devices or different browsers on the same device within a given month, the first access through each such device or browser is counted as a separate monthly unique visitor, except where adjusted based upon TrueCar.com log-in information. We calculate average monthly unique visitors as the sum of the monthly unique visitors in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We view our average monthly unique visitors as a key indicator of the growth in our business and audience reach, the strength of our brand, and the visibility of car-buying services to the member base of our affinity group marketing partners.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions on an ongoing basis and that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $0.1 million, or 0.6%, for 2020 as compared to 2019. We expect our depreciation and amortization expenses to continue to be affected by the amount of capitalized internally developed software costs, property and equipment, and the timing of placing projects in service.\nIncome Taxes\ndealer to place qualifying vehicles at more prominent positions within the used car search results page. TrueCar Reach is a service offered to retarget in-market consumers on the dealer's behalf with co-branded emails. Fees are charged based on a monthly subscription rate for the right to sponsor up to a set number of vehicles at any time throughout the month under Sponsored Listings. Fees for our Reach product are also charged on a flat monthly rate regardless of the number of emails delivered.\nDealer Revenue\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nBenefit from Income Taxes\nTransaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred, and are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.\nOn occasion, we issue credits to our TrueCar Certified Dealers with respect to units sold. However, we do not adjust our unit metric for these credits as we believe that in most cases a vehicle has in fact been purchased through our platform given the high degree of accuracy of our sales matching process. Credits are most frequently issued to a dealer that claims that it had a pre-existing relationship with a purchaser of a vehicle, and we determine whether we will issue a credit based on a number of factors, including the facts and circumstances related to the dealer claim and the level of claim activity at the dealership. In most cases, we issue credits in order to maintain strong business relations with the dealer and not because we have made an erroneous sales match or billing error.\nFranchise Dealer Count\nAuto Buying Program Add-On Features. We offer additional add-on products to eligible Dealers as part of the Auto Buying Program to increase traffic and retarget in-market consumers. These products include TrueCar Sponsored Listings ( Sponsored Listings\u201d) and TrueCar Reach ( Reach\u201d). Sponsored Listings enables a Dealer to place qualifying vehicles at more prominent positions within the used car search results page. Reach is a service offered to retarget in-market consumers on the Dealer's behalf with co-branded emails. Fees are charged based on a monthly subscription rate for the right to sponsor up to a set number of vehicles at any time throughout the month under Sponsored Listings. Fees for our Reach product are also charged on a flat monthly rate regardless of the number of emails delivered. Subscription fees are recognized on a monthly basis.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\n \nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily consists of interest on our built-to-suit lease financing obligations in years prior to 2019.\n\nQuarterly Key Metrics and Results of Operations\n\n\nWe enter into arrangements with OEMs to promote the sale of their vehicles primarily through the offering of additional consumer incentives. These manufacturers pay us a per-vehicle fee for promotion of the incentive after the sale of the vehicle has occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the dealer. Under the old revenue standard, in years prior to 2018, we recognized as revenue the per-vehicle incentive fee at the time the sale of the vehicle occurred between the Auto Buying Program user and the dealer. Under the new revenue standard, our performance obligation to OEMs is to deliver incentive offers to consumers. Control transfers upon delivery of incentive offers, which is the point at which we recognize revenue. We recognize revenue for the amount that we estimate we will be able to earn. To formulate this estimate, we use the expected value method based primarily on an analysis of the expected number of sales resulting from in-period incentive offers delivered. This estimate is based on historical incentive offers to vehicle sales close rate trends as well as delivered incentive offers resulting in actual sales measured in period. As a result, revenue recognition occurs earlier than billing as an estimate of the variable consideration to be received upon control transfer, resulting in a contract asset.\nTechnology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses; third-party contractor fees; facilities costs; software costs; and costs associated with our product development, product management, research and analytics, and internal IT functions.\nDealer. Dealer revenue is comprised of Auto Buying Program revenue as well as revenue from TrueCar Trade and DealerScience. During 2020, we introduced TrueCar Access, which offers dealers our subscription-based package that combines our TrueCar Trade solution and payments solution from DealerScience.\nPresentation of Financial Statements\n\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nRevenues\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations of $121.4 million in 2020 includes net cash provided by operating activities of $9.2 million and cash provided by investing activities of $112.2 million, primarily from cash proceeds received from the sale of ALG. See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWhen a user decides to proceed with a vehicle purchase through us, the user provides his or her name, address, e-mail, and phone number during the process of obtaining price offers on actual vehicle inventory, which gives us the identity and source of a TrueCar introduction provided to a specific Dealer before an actual sale occurs. After a sale occurs, we receive information regarding the sale, including the identity of the purchaser, through the Dealer Management System used by the Dealer that made the sale. We also receive information regarding vehicle sales from a variety of other data sources, including third-party car sales aggregators, car dealer networks, and other publicly available sources (collectively, sales data\u201d) and we use this sales data to further verify that a sale has occurred between an Auto Buying Program user and a TrueCar Certified Dealer, as well as to invoice the Dealer shortly after the completion of the sales transaction. Actual vehicle sales data is reported on a daily basis shortly following the date of sale.\nInterest Expense\nWe also recognize revenue from Dealers under subscription agreements. Subscription fee arrangements are short-term in nature with terms ranging from one to six months and are also cancellable by the Dealer or us at any time. Subscription arrangements fall into three types: flat-rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales ( guaranteed sales\u201d), and subscriptions based on introduction volume, including those subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions ( guaranteed introductions\u201d). For all subscription arrangements, we recognize the fees as revenue when introductions are delivered by allocating a portion of the monthly subscription fee to each delivered introduction. For guaranteed sales and guaranteed introduction subscriptions, the amount allocated is adjusted at the end of each month for any credits, as described below. Total revenue recognized in any given month remains unchanged from the old revenue standard for subscription arrangements.\nAdditionally, we are accelerating our investment in digital automotive retailing as we seek to bring more of the purchasing process online to further support the needs of our dealers and consumers during this challenging and changing environment.\nOther Revenues\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in technology and development expenses of $4.1 million, or 6.9%, for 2019 as compared to 2018 is primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation of $2.3 million, a $0.8 million decrease in professional fees for outsourced services, and a $0.6 million decrease in employee-related expenses due to reduced headcount.\n(6)The excluded amount represents a non-cash impairment charge we recognized on our goodwill during the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\n\nCash used in investing activities of $33.4 million during 2019 resulted primarily from a $23.2 million equity method investment in Accu-Trade as well as $10.2 million of purchases of property and equipment, consisting primarily of $9.8 million of investments in software.\nWe are monitoring the impact of the pandemic on our business and implementing plans to take appropriate actions to adapt to changing circumstances arising from the pandemic. Specifically, we have launched Buy from Home\u201d badge labeling of dealers\nThe number of average monthly unique visitors increased 12.3% to approximately 8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from approximately 7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to improvements to our search engine optimization strategy and a surge in online browsing as a result of COVID-19.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries in accordance with FASB ASC 810 - Consolidation. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\ntax liabilities. The benefit from income taxes for 2019 of $1.3 million primarily reflects a tax benefit associated with the intraperiod tax allocation required by ASC 740. The benefit from income taxes for 2018 of $1.2 million primarily reflects a tax benefit associated with the intraperiod tax allocation required by ASC 740.\nSet forth below is information concerning our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses of $75.1 million, or 33.1%, for 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflected a $30.2 million decrease in partner marketing and revenue share paid to affinity marketing partners, a $23.4 million decrease in branded media spend, and a $10.5 million decrease, net of severance costs, in salaries and employee-related expenses due to reduced headcount following the restructuring undertaken in the second quarter of 2020. Further decreases include a $6.3 million decline in conference and travel-related expenses and a $4.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation.\n\nUnits\nAuto Buying Program revenue consists of fees paid by dealers participating in our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. Dealers pay us these fees on a per-vehicle basis for sales to our users, on a per-introduction basis for sales to our users or in the form of a subscription arrangement. Subscription arrangements fall into several types: flat-rate subscriptions, subscriptions subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of vehicle sales, which we refer to as guaranteed-sales subscriptions, and subscriptions based on introduction volume, including those subject to downward adjustment based on a minimum number of introductions, which we refer to as guaranteed-introductions subscriptions. Additionally, certain dealers pay an incremental subscription fee for add-on products within our Auto Buying Program.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur revenues are comprised primarily of dealer revenue and OEM incentives revenue. We recognize transaction revenue for certain of our Auto Buying Program and OEM incentives arrangements at the time introductions and incentives are delivered based upon expected subsequent vehicle sales between the Auto Buying Program user and the dealer.\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make operating and strategic decisions.\nWe adopted the new revenue standard as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The updated standard replaces all pre-existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with prior revenue guidance.\n(2) Purchase obligations include long-term agreements to purchase data information, software related licenses and support services, and other obligations that are enforceable and legally binding as of December 31, 2020. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.\nWe define independent dealer count as the number of independent dealers in the network of TrueCar Certified Dealers who participate in our Auto Buying Program at the end of a given period that exclusively sell used vehicles and are not directly affiliated with a new car manufacturer. This number is calculated by counting each location, or rooftop, individually, regardless of the size of the dealership that owns the rooftop. Our independent dealer count decreased to 3,794 at December 31, 2020 from 4,395 at December 31, 2019 and from 3,655 at December 31, 2018. The decline in independent dealer count was primarily due to suspensions, cancellations or going-out-of-business due to COVID-19. We expect our independent dealer count to continue to fluctuate due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOEM Incentives. OEM incentives revenue consists of fees paid by automobile manufacturers, or OEMs, to promote the sale of their vehicles through the offering of additional consumer incentives to members of our affinity group marketing partners. These OEMs pay us a subscription or per-vehicle fee for promotion of the incentive.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in sales and marketing expenses of $15.8 million, or 7.5%, for 2019 as compared to 2018 reflected a $6.9 million increase in salaries and employee-related expenses, a $5.1 million increase in branded media spend, a $3.0 million increase in partner marketing and revenue share paid to affinity marketing partners, a $1.1 increase in facilities costs, a $0.8 million increase in creative production costs, and a $0.7 million increase in professional fees for outsourced services. These increases were partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a $0.5 million decrease in conference and travel-related expense and a $0.4 million decrease in marketing and other expenses.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included herein. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere herein. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nGoodwill Impairment\n(3) Contingent consideration as part of the DealerScience acquisition relates to the second earnout payment presented at its fair value. The undiscounted earnout payment of $2.5 million for DealerScience is due in 2021.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:\n\nOur net loss and cash flows used in operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support our growth, and marketing and advertising expenses. We have experienced positive operating cash flows despite having experienced a net loss due to the inclusion of non-cash expenses and charges.\n(1)We issued full credits of the amount originally invoiced with respect to 17,655, 21,201, and 23,885 units during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As discussed in the description of the units metric below, we have not adjusted the number of units downward to reflect these credited units.\nWe recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\nDealerScience. DealerScience revenues consist of monthly subscription fees paid by dealers for access to DealerScience's products and services. DealerScience provides dealers with advanced digital retailing software tools that allow them to calculate accurate monthly payments, expedite vehicle desking, which is the process of presenting and agreeing upon financial terms and financing options, and streamline the consumers' experience from shopping to showroom. Dealers pay monthly subscription fees for access to the software. Subscription fees are recognized on a monthly basis.\nThe following tables set forth selected key metrics and unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data for each of the quarters indicated. The consolidated financial statements for each of these quarters have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the consolidated results of operations for these periods. You should read this information together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.\n(1)The excluded amounts include stock-based compensation of $7.2 million incurred in the second quarter of 2019 associated with the acceleration of certain equity awards and the extension of the exercise period for certain vested stock options related to the departures of certain executives, including our former chief executive officer.\nOur franchise dealer count decreased to 10,589 at December 31, 2020 from 12,565 at December 31, 2019 and from 12,674 at December 31, 2018. The decline in franchise dealer count was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as government authorities imposed restrictions on retail activity and a number of dealers opting to suspend their marketing spend to preserve their profitability during times of economic uncertainty. We expect our franchise dealer count to continue to fluctuate due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the termination of our partnership with USAA Federal Savings Bank.\nTrueCar is a leading automotive digital marketplace that enables car buyers to connect to our network of Certified Dealers. We are building the industry's most personalized and efficient car buying experience as we seek to bring more of the purchasing process online.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of television, digital, and radio advertising; media production costs; affinity group partner marketing fees, which also include loan subvention costs where we pay certain affinity group marketing partners a portion of consumers' borrowing costs for car loan products offered by these affinity group marketing partners; common stock warrants issued to USAA; marketing sponsorship programs; and digital customer acquisition. See Part III, Item 13 Certain Relationships, Related Party and Other Transactions - Strategic Partnerships - United Services Automobile Association\u201d for a description of our previous arrangements with USAA. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include employee-related expenses for sales, customer support, marketing and public relations employees, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses; third-party contractor fees; and facilities costs. Marketing and advertising costs promote our services and are expensed as incurred, except for media production costs, which are expensed the first time the advertisement is aired.\nFinally, our former ALG subsidiary provided forecasts and consulting services regarding determination of the residual value of an automobile at given future points in time. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition, financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease, and fleet portfolios. On November 30, 2020, we divested ALG to J.D. Power. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further details.\n* Less than 0.5% of revenues\nThe following table summarizes net cash derived from operating, investing, and financing activities from continuing operations, as well as net cash from discontinued operations:\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income decreased $2.0 million, or 81.4%, for 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates.\nWe define franchise dealer count as the number of franchise dealers in the network of TrueCar Certified Dealers who participate in our Auto Buying Program at the end of a given period. This number is calculated by counting the number of brands of new cars sold at each individual location, or rooftop, regardless of the size of the dealership that owns the rooftop. The network is comprised of dealers with a range of unit sales volume per dealer, with dealers representing certain brands consistently achieving higher than average unit sales volume. We view our ability to increase our franchise dealer count, particularly dealers representing high volume brands, as an indicator of our market penetration and the likelihood of converting users of our platform into unit sales. Our TrueCar Certified Dealer network includes independent non-franchised dealers that primarily sell used cars and are not included in franchise dealer count.\nOther Income. Other income primarily consists of fees earned associated with the transition services agreement with J.D. Power as a result of our ALG divestiture.\nWe test for goodwill impairment annually at December 31. At December 31, 2020, we estimated the fair value of our single reporting unit using a market approach, which is based on the market capitalization by using our share price in the NASDAQ Global Market and an appropriate control premium. As our market capitalization without consideration for any control premium was higher than the net book value of our reporting unit, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other income consists of fees earned from the transition services agreement associated with the divestiture of ALG.\nrevenues for 2019 as compared to 90.9%, 9.0%, and 0.1%, respectively, of revenues for 2018. The increase of $13.4 million in dealer revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected a 0.6% increase in monetization, along with increases within newer revenue streams of $9.2 million primarily due to our Trade and DealerScience products as well as an increase of $4.2 million due to growth in used car sales in 2019. The decrease of $13.4 million in OEM incentive revenue was primarily due to the lack of recurring revenue from a large OEM client and softness in our existing clients in 2019. Other revenue for 2019 remained materially consistent as compared to 2018.\n \nResults of Operations\nFlat-Rate Subscription. Under flat-rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of introductions provided by us to the Dealer or sales made to users of our platform by the Dealer.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, severance, and stock-based compensation expenses for executive, finance, accounting, legal, and human resources functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal, accounting, and other third-party professional service fees, bad debt, lease exit costs, and facilities costs.\n(4)The excluded amounts represent charges associated with the restructuring plans undertaken in the second quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2019 to improve efficiency and reduce expenses. We believe excluding the impact of these charges is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of our ongoing operating results.\nOur performance obligation to TrueCar Certified Dealers is the same for all payment types for our Auto Buying Program revenues: to provide Dealers with introductions to in-market consumers through the use of the TrueCar platform, so that those Dealers have the opportunity to sell vehicles to those consumers. Control transfers to Dealers upon delivery of introductions, which is the point at which we recognize revenue.\nWe have experienced significant disruptions since the outbreak was declared a pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted our results of operations as reflected in the year over year decline in revenues and could further impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity and duration of the outbreak, actions taken by government authorities, economic uncertainty, the increasing number of consumers who are unemployed, and vehicle inventory shortages caused by closures in OEM production facilities. Our future results of operations and liquidity could be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms and concessions that we may provide to our customers. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional disclosures of risks related to COVID-19.\n(1) Lease obligations consist of various leases for office space and have not been reduced by minimum non-cancelable sublease rentals aggregating $1.5 million.\nWe do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, as part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. General and administrative expenses decreased $14.3 million, or 22.3%, for 2020 as compared to 2019. The decrease is primarily due to a $8.1 million decrease in costs for consulting and outsourced services, a $4.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a $3.0 million decrease in employee-related expenses due to decreased headcount following the restructuring undertaken in the second quarter of 2020, and a $1.2 million decrease in conference and travel-related expenses. These decreases were offset by a $2.1 million impairment charge on our right-of-use asset associated with an office lease and a $1.5 million increase in bad debt expense driven by an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts due in part to the impact of COVID-19.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $12.8 million. This was primarily due to a loss from continuing operations of $58.3 million, which adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense of $36.5 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $20.7 million and amortization of lease right-of-use assets of $5.9 million. Net cash provided by operation activities also included a $3.7 million increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $3.7 million increase primarily reflected an increase of $10.5 in accrued expenses and other current liabilities mainly driven by accrued marketing costs and a $4.0 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of cash collections, offset by a $6.8 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a $4.9 million decrease in accounts payable.\nTrueCar Trade revenue consists of dealers who pay monthly subscription fees that vary depending on the level of trade service selected. Depending on their subscription terms, some dealers pay additional transaction fees for each vehicle purchased from a consumer that was introduced via TrueCar Trade.\n \nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. We provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, as it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result of the valuation allowance, our income tax benefit (or expense) is significantly less than the federal statutory rate of 21%. Our benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily arose in connection with the impairment of goodwill, resulting in reduction of indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities. Our benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflects a tax benefit associated with the intraperiod allocation required by ASC 740.\nIn years prior to 2020, we determined our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical write-off experience and specific circumstances that make it likely that recovery will not occur. We reviewed the allowance for doubtful accounts periodically and assessed the aging of account balances, with an emphasis on those that are past due over ninety days. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.\n(3)The excluded amounts include $4.6 million in executive severance costs, as well as related recruiting fees of $0.5 million, associated with the separation of our former chief executive officer and the termination of executive-level employees in connection with the change in chief executive officer in the second quarter of 2019. We believe excluding the impact of these terminations and the associated chief executive officer recruiting fees is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of our ongoing operating results.\noffering such solutions designed to help consumers and dealers safely and remotely navigate car buying in response to social distancing guidelines during COVID-19. Dealers badged with Buy from Home\u201d on the TrueCar platform offer the following features:\nTechnology and Development Expenses\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.\n(9)Non-GAAP net income (loss) is not a measure of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For a definition of Non-GAAP net income (loss) see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nDealerScience revenue consists of monthly subscription fees paid by dealers for access to the DealerScience products and services. DealerScience provides dealers with advanced digital retailing software tools that allow them to calculate accurate monthly payments, expedite vehicle desking, which is the process of presenting and agreeing upon financial terms and financing options, and streamline the consumers' experience from shopping to showroom.\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of $278.7 million and recorded a net income of $76.5 million, which comprised of $96.4 million income from discontinued operations offset by $19.8 million loss from continuing operations.\nWe report our financial results as one operating segment, with three distinct service offerings: Dealer products and services, OEM incentives, and other. Our operating results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker on a consolidated basis, principally to make decisions about how we allocate our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance. Our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews revenue for each of our dealer, OEM incentives and other offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the factors driving our business.\n\nWe have established a diverse software ecosystem on a common technology infrastructure, powered by proprietary data and analytics. Our company-branded platform is available on our TrueCar website and mobile applications. In addition, we customize and operate our platform on a co-branded basis for our many affinity group marketing partners, including financial institutions like PenFed and American Express; membership-based organizations like Consumer Reports, AARP, Sam's Club, and AAA; and employee buying programs for large enterprises such as IBM and Walmart. We enable users to obtain market-based pricing data on new and used cars, and to connect with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We also allow automobile manufacturers, known in the industry as OEMs, to connect with TrueCar users during the purchase process and efficiently deliver targeted incentives to consumers.\nShare Repurchase Program\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\nCash used in financing activities of $0.5 million for 2019 reflects taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards of $3.3 million, offset by $2.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\n\nKey Metrics\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGuaranteed-Introductions Subscription. Under guaranteed-introductions subscription arrangements, monthly fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the Dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the Dealer. If the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees.\nOverview\nCash used in financing activities of $49.2 million during 2020 primarily represents payments of $42.8 million for the repurchase of our common stock, taxes paid of $4.3 million for the net shares settlement of equity awards, and a $2.3 million payment related to the fair value portion of a contingent consideration related to our 2018 acquisition of DealerScience.\n\n\u2022Home vehicle delivery\n(1)We issued full credits of the amount originally invoiced with respect to 4,505, 4,790, 2,847, 5,513, 5,423, 6,100, 3,985 and 5,693 units during the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019, and March 31, 2019, respectively. The number of units has not been adjusted downward to reflect units credited.\nDeferred revenue is recognized on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets when payments are received in advance of us meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria described above.\nCash used in investing activities of $42.2 million during 2018 resulted primarily from $26.9 million of cash paid for the acquisition of DealerScience and $16.1 million of purchases of property and equipment, consisting primary of $12.5 million of investments in software.\nGuaranteed-Sales Subscription. Under guaranteed-sales subscription arrangements, monthly fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the Dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the Dealer. If the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. As of January 1, 2019, we no longer offer guaranteed sales subscription arrangements in California, and we transferred all California dealers from this billing method to flat-rate subscription arrangements before that date.\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations of $7.8 million in 2018 includes net cash provided by operating activities of $8.8 million, offset by cash used in investing activities of $1.0 million for purchases of property and equipment.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. General and administrative expenses increased $11.6 million, or 21.9%, for 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase is primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to $3.2 million in severance costs associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer in the second quarter of 2019, a $3.4 million increase in stock-based compensation primarily due to the acceleration of certain equity awards and the extension of the exercise period for certain vested stock options provided to our former chief executive officer, a $2.2 million increase in costs for consulting and outsourced services, and a $1.0 million increase in overhead and facilities costs.\nNet Cash Provided by Discontinued Operations\nRevenues\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, sales allowances and allowances for doubtful accounts, the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, the recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, income taxes, and the expensing and capitalization of software and website development costs have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nWe have incurred cumulative losses of $355.5 million from our operations through December 31, 2020, and expect to incur additional losses in the future. We are continuously monitoring our liquidity and anticipated capital requirements in light of the significant uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue levels, the timing and extent of our spending to support our technology and development efforts, costs related to potential acquisitions to further expand our business and product offerings, collection of accounts receivable, macroeconomic activity, and the length and severity of business disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents, and cash from operations, are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\nOther revenues in the past have been immaterial. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other revenues primarily consists of fees earned related to the USAA transition services agreement that terminated on September 30, 2020.\nWe use a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Step one, recognition, requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, no benefits of the position are recognized. If we determine that a position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained, then we proceed to step two, measurement, which is based on the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized on effective settlement. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. If actual results differ from our estimates, our net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be materially impacted.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $273.3 million.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus, a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and the world. This has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including quarantines, shelter-in-place\u201d and stay-at-home\u201d orders, travel restrictions, and temporary closures of non-essential businesses. We have taken proactive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers by closing our offices, requiring employees to work from home and suspending travel, in-person meetings and visits with our customers. We expect to continue these measures until the pandemic is adequately contained as determined by authorities.\n\nCapitalized software costs decreased $2.7 million for 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in third-party software of $1.9 million and a decrease in the amount of internally-developed software of $0.8 million.\nCapitalized software costs decreased $0.6 million for 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in the amount of internally-developed software of $0.9 million offset by an increase in third-party software of $0.4 million.\nWe calculate the expected credit losses on a pool basis for those trade receivables that have similar risk characteristics. For those trade receivables that do not share similar risk characteristics, the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics relevant to our accounts receivable include revenue billing model and aging status.\n(7)The excluded amount represents an impairment charge on our ROU assets associated with certain of our existing office locations. We consider these charges to be unrelated to our underlying results of operations and believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons.\n\u2022Remote paperwork processing\n\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Non-GAAP net (loss) income for each of the periods presented:\nInterest Income\nThe results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nAverage Monthly Unique Visitors\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the year that includes the enactment date. We determine deferred tax assets including net operating losses and liabilities, based on temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We have a full valuation allowance, and have concluded, based on the weight of all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized, primarily due to our historical net operating losses.\nThe number of units decreased 23.2% to 766,413 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 998,495 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The unit decrease is primarily due to COVID-19, which was declared by the World Health Organization as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, as well as the wind-down of our partnership with USAA that ended on September 30, 2020. With COVID-19, social distancing was encouraged with many government authorities issuing shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders, the closing of non-essential businesses, and temporary shutdowns of OEM production facilities. In 2021, we expect total units to be impacted by the continued effects of COVID-19 as well as the termination of the USAA partnership.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets resulting from business combinations, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss equals to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. Fair value is determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows. When measuring the recoverability of these assets, we make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. During the year December 31, 2020, we recorded a ROU asset impairment charge of $2.1 million related to an operating lease. See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairment charges recorded on long-lived assets.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in our business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations, or a decline in our stock price and market capitalization.\nCash provided by financing activities of $16.7 million for 2018 reflects $19.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by taxes paid for the net share settlement of certain equity awards of $3.0 million.\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting guidance on measuring credit losses on our trade accounts receivable. The new credit loss guidance replaces the old model for measuring the allowance for credit losses with a model that is based on the expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new credit loss model, lifetime expected credit losses are measured and recognized at each reporting date based on historical, current and forecast information.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in our revenues of $56.4 million, or 16.8%, in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflected a decrease in our dealer revenue offset by an increase in other revenue. Dealer revenue, OEM incentives revenue, and other revenue comprised 90.8%, 6.0%, and 3.2%, respectively, of revenues for 2020 as compared to 94.9%, 4.9%, and 0.2%, respectively, for 2019. The decrease of $65.0 million in dealer revenue for 2020 reflected a decrease in our Auto Buying Program revenue of $65.8 million primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and concessions we provided to certain subscription arrangements as well as the wind-down of our partnership with USAA, offset by increases within newer revenue streams of $0.8 million. These decreases were offset by an increase of $8.4 million in other revenue primarily driven by fees earned related to the USAA transition services agreement for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods indicated.\nPay-Per-Introduction. Under fee arrangements based on a pay-per-introduction billing model, revenue for the Auto Buying Program is recognized when introductions are delivered.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nCash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $16.1 million. This was primarily due to a loss from continuing operations of $31.7 million, which adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense of $35.6 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $17.8 million. Net cash provided by operating activities also included a $7.7 million decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $7.7 million decrease primarily reflected a $9.0 million decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of cash collections, a $3.6 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to an increase in prepaid marketing costs, offset by a $7.5 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to an increase in marketing fees payable to our affinity group partners and advertisers.\n \nUnder the new guidance, we consider the need to adjust historical information to reflect the extent to which we expect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to differ from the conditions that existed for the period over which historical information was evaluated. The primary current and future economic indicators that we use to develop our current estimate of expected losses included the current and forecast U.S. Gross Domestic Product ( GDP\u201d).\n(8)For periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, there was no income tax impact related to the adjustments made to calculate Non-GAAP net (loss) income because of our available net operating loss carryforwards and the full valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company experienced a decline in its enterprise market capitalization. Additionally, as a result of the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the Company's announcement that it had entered into a short-term agreement to extend its partnership with USAA Federal Savings Bank to continue to power the USAA Car Buying Service through September 30, 2020, we concluded a triggering event had occurred. In light of these factors, we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020, in which we estimated the fair value of our single reporting unit by utilizing an income approach which uses a discounted cash flow analysis. Given the high degree of market volatility and lack of reliable market data as of March 31, 2020, we determined that the income approach provided the best approximation of fair value. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant assumptions and judgments, which are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy, including the revenue growth rates, workforce cost savings, long-term growth rates and the discount rate. Our assumptions were based on historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit, it is possible that a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if changes in macroeconomic conditions outside the control of management change such that it results in a significant negative impact on our estimated fair value, the fair value of our reporting unit may decrease below its net carrying value, which could result in further impairment of our goodwill.\n\nWe have the option to assess goodwill for possible impairment by performing a qualitative analysis to determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or perform the first step in an impairment test. The first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. Interest income decreased $0.3 million, or 11.1%, for 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to lower interest rates.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $2.9 million, or 16.1%, for 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase is primarily due to a $2.4 million increase related to intangible assets acquired from the acquisition of DealerScience in December 2018 and a $0.6 million net increase associated with the reclassification of certain build-to-suit assets to leasehold improvements upon adoption of the new lease guidance in January 2019.\nSoftware and Website Development Costs\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our board of directors authorized an open market stock repurchase program (the Program\u201d) of up to $75 million to allow for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through September 30, 2022. The timing and amount of any repurchases is determined by us based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Repurchases of our common stock may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws, open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate us to purchase any minimum number of shares. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased and retired a total of 9.3 million shares under the Program for $42.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, we have a remaining authorization of $32.8 million for future share repurchases.\nCertain of our subscription arrangements are charged based on volume of introductions provided while other introduction-based subscription arrangements operate under a guaranteed-introductions model. Under guaranteed-introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on a periodically-updated formula that considers, among other things, the introductions anticipated to be provided to the dealer. To the extent that the number of actual introductions is less than the number of guaranteed introductions, we provide a credit to the dealer. If the actual number of introductions provided exceeds the number guaranteed, we are not entitled to any additional fees.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, increased $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a gain on sale of $92.5 million recognized on the ALG divestiture. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for more information.\nMonetization\n(7)The excluded amount represents an impairment charge on our ROU assets associated with certain of our existing office locations. We consider these charges to be unrelated to our underlying results of operations and believe that their exclusion is appropriate to facilitate period-to-period operating performance comparisons.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cost of revenue of $6.3 million, or 22.6%, for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to a $2.6 million decrease in data and licensing costs, a $1.8 million decrease in employee-related costs related to reduced headcount following the restructuring undertaken in the second quarter of 2020, a $0.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation, and a $0.6 million decrease in conference and travel-related expenses.\n(8)Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nInvesting Activities of Continuing Operations\n(2)Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) are not measures of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income (loss), or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss), see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nInterest Income. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nContractual Obligations\nOur subsidiary, TCDS, provides our TrueCar Trade and Payments products. Our Trade solution gives consumers information on the value of their trade-in vehicles and enables them to obtain a guaranteed trade-in price before setting foot in the dealership. This valuation is, in turn, backed by a third-party guarantee to dealers that the vehicles will be repurchased at the indicated price if the dealer does not want to keep them. Our Payments solution leverages the digital retailing technology of our DealerScience subsidiary, acquired in December 2018, to help consumers calculate accurate monthly payments.\nWe are party to a credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank that provides for advances of up to $35.0 million. This credit facility provides a $10.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit and contains an increase option permitting us, subject to the lender's consent, to increase the revolving credit facility by up to $15.0 million, to an aggregate maximum of $50.0 million. The credit facility has a three-year term and matures on February 18, 2021. Prior to the expiration of the credit facility, we extended the maturity date to April 19, 2021. No amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2020. The amount available under the credit facility at December 31, 2020 was $32.2 million, reduced for the letters of credit issued and outstanding under the subfacility of $2.8 million. See Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements herein for more information about our amended credit facility.\n\u2022Verified vehicle sanitization\nIncome from Discontinued Operations\n(2)The excluded amounts relate to legal costs incurred in connection with complaints filed by non-TrueCar dealers against TrueCar and consumer class action lawsuits. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the excluded amount also includes a $2.0 million payment received from one of our insurance carriers in settlement of a lawsuit we brought in the fourth quarter of 2017 to recover insured legal fees. We believe the exclusion of these costs and recovery is appropriate to facilitate comparisons of our core operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Based on the nature of the specific claims underlying the excluded litigation matters, once these matters are resolved, we do not believe our operations are likely to entail defending against the types of claims raised by these matters.\nYears ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The benefit from income taxes for 2020 of less than $0.1 million primarily arose in connection with the impairment of goodwill, resulting in reduction of indefinite-lived deferred\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n \n(3)The excluded amounts include $4.6 million in executive severance costs, as well as related recruiting fees of $0.5 million, associated with the separation of our former chief executive officer and the termination of executive-level employees in connection with the change in chief executive officer in the second quarter of 2019. We believe excluding the impact of these terminations and the associated chief executive officer recruiting fees is consistent with our use of these non-GAAP measures as we do not believe they are a useful indicator of our ongoing operating results.\nGoodwill\nOther Income\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in technology and development expenses of $11.2 million, or 19.9%, for 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflected a $6.2 million decrease, net of severance costs, in salaries and employee-related expenses due to reduced headcount following the restructuring undertaken in the second quarter of 2020, a $3.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation, and a $1.2 million decrease in conference and travel-related expenses.\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations of $6.4 million in 2019 includes net cash provided by operating activities of $7.5 million, offset by cash used in investing activities of $1.1 million for purchases of property and equipment.\nWe offer additional add-on products to eligible dealers as part of the Auto Buying Program to increase traffic and retarget in-market consumers. These products include TrueCar Sponsored Listings and TrueCar Reach. TrueCar Sponsor Listings enables a\nSee Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements included herein for more information about our provision for income taxes.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for an acquisition and allocate the purchase price to the respective net tangible and intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, and selection of discount rates. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in arriving at fair value measurements in connection with fair values of assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Cost of revenue includes expenses related to the fulfillment of our services, consisting primarily of data costs and licensing fees paid to third-party service providers and expenses related to operating our website and mobile applications, including data center costs; hosting fees; data processing costs required to deliver introductions to our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers; employee costs related to certain dealer operations and sales matching; and facilities costs. Cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization of software costs and other hosting and data infrastructure equipment used to operate our platforms, which are included in the depreciation and amortization line item on our statements of comprehensive loss.\nOEM Incentives Revenue\nWe define units as the number of automobiles purchased from TrueCar Certified Dealers that are matched to users of TrueCar.com, our TrueCar-branded mobile applications or the car-buying sites and mobile applications we maintain for our affinity group marketing partners. A unit is counted after we have matched the sale to a TrueCar user with one of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We view units as a key indicator of the health of our business, the effectiveness of our product and the size and geographic coverage of our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nUnder guaranteed-sales subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on the number of guaranteed sales multiplied by a fixed amount per vehicle. To the extent that the actual number of vehicles sold by the dealers to users of our platform is less than the number of guaranteed sales, we provide a credit to the dealer. If the actual number of vehicles sold exceeds the number of guaranteed sales, we are not entitled to any additional fees. As of January 1, 2019, we no longer offer guaranteed sales subscription arrangements in California, and we transferred all California dealers from this billing method to flat-rate subscription arrangements before that date.\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.\nUnder flat-rate subscription arrangements, fees are charged at a monthly flat rate regardless of the number of introductions made to users of our platform by the dealer.\nComponents of Operating Results\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairment charges recorded on our goodwill. We elected to conduct a quantitative assessment using a market approach, which is based on the market capitalization by using our share price in the NASDAQ Global Market and an appropriate control premium. As our market capitalization without consideration for any control premium exceeded the carrying value, we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nOperating Activities of Continuing Operations\nOur Auto Buying Program revenue includes fees paid by customers participating in the Company's dealer network with which the Company has an agreement ( TrueCar Certified Dealers\u201d or Dealers\u201d). TrueCar Certified Dealers pay us fees in one of three ways: on a per-vehicle basis for sales to Auto Buying Program users, on a per-introduction basis for sales to Auto Buying Program users or under a subscription arrangement. Additionally, certain Dealers pay an incremental subscription fee for add-on products within our Auto Buying Program. Contracts are cancellable by the Dealer or us at any time. We do not provide significant dealer financing terms.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense decreased $2.6 million to zero in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to our exit from our San Francisco leased office space as of December 31, 2018, and with the adoption of the new leasing standard and the de-recognition of our lease financing obligation for our Santa Monica leased office space.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts\nWe had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $269.2 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $215.1 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, we also had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $13.0 million and $10.2 million, respectively. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code impose substantial restrictions on the use of net operating losses and other tax attributes in the event of a cumulative ownership change\u201d of a corporation of more than 50% over a three-year period. We experienced a cumulative ownership change as of December 31, 2019 within the meanings of Sections 382 and 383. During the second quarter of 2020, we estimated that up to $86.8 million and $2.5 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, may expire unused. This limitation resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets of $18.4 million and was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance, with no net tax provision impact. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our Section 382 and 383 limitation to account for the divestiture of ALG's net assets. We estimate that up to $15.2 million and $0.5 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, may expire unused. The Section 382 limitation resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets of $3.2 million and was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance, with no net tax provision impact. Additionally, pending finalization of the 2011-2020 research and development tax credit study, we anticipate that certain federal research and development credit carryforwards may expire unused.\nCosts incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages of development and maintenance of our platform are expensed as incurred. Certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a new product or projects to provide significant additional functionality to existing products are capitalized if certain criteria are met. Maintenance and enhancement costs are typically expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are estimated to be three years. Amortization expense is included in depreciation and amortization in the statements of comprehensive loss.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2020 was $29.9 million. This was primarily due to a loss from continuing operations of $19.8 million, which adjusted for non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense of $23.1 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $20.4 million, goodwill impairment of $8.3 million, amortization of lease right-of-use assets of $5.4 million, bad debt expense of $3.0 million, and asset impairment and write-off of $2.4 million primarily due to a ROU asset impairment of $2.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities also included a $14.2 million decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $14.2 million decrease primarily reflected a decrease of $8.2 million in accounts payable primarily due to a decrease in marketing fees payable to our affinity group partners and advertisers, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $6.3 million and a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.1 million driven by reduced accrued legal fees, offset by an increase of $2.3 million in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of cash collections, an increase of $1.3 million in prepaid expense and other assets primarily due to a decrease in prepaid marketing costs.\nOur investing activities consist primarily of cash paid for equity method investment, the acquisition of DealerScience and capital expenditures for capitalized software development costs and property and equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of $8.3 million, which represents the amount that our carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value at March 31, 2020. For further details, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code impose substantial restrictions on the use of net operating losses and other tax attributes in the event of a cumulative ownership change\u201d of a corporation of more than 50% over a three-year period. We experienced a cumulative ownership change as of December 31, 2019 within the meanings of Sections 382 and 383. During the second quarter of 2020, we estimated that up to $86.8 million and $2.5 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, may expire unused. This limitation resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets of $18.4 million and was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in its valuation allowance, with no net tax provision impact.

Additionally, pending finalization of the 2011-2020 research and development tax credit study, we anticipate that certain federal research and development credit carryforwards may expire unused.\nFor guaranteed-sales and guaranteed-introductions subscription arrangements, fees are charged based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of sales generated or introductions delivered through our platform during the subscription period multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction or (ii) the guaranteed number of sales or introductions multiplied by the contracted price per sale/introduction.", "item_7_tables": "Table 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

TrueCar provides an automotive digital marketplace that connects car buyers with Certified Dealers. Revenues come from dealer fees, OEM incentives, and other sources.\n\n- Revenues decreased 16.8% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower dealer revenue as a result of COVID-19 and the wind-down of the USAA partnership. Other revenue increased due to fees from a USAA transition services agreement.\n\n- Net income was $76.5 million in 2020 compared to a net loss of $54.9 million in 2019, mainly due to a $96.4 million gain on the sale of the ALG subsidiary. Excluding this, there was a loss from continuing operations in 2020.\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA was $28.1 million in 2020 compared to $13.6 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to lower operating expenses.\n\n- Units decreased 23.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, also attributed to COVID-19 and the USAA partnership wind-down. Average monthly unique visitors increased due to search engine optimization. \n\n- Cash provided by operating activities was $29.9 million in 2020 compared to $12.8 million in 2019. Cash from investing activities was used mainly for software investments. Cash from financing activities included share repurchases.\n\n- The report discusses the impact of COVID-19, including its effect on revenues, units, and dealer count. It also provides updates on key strategic initiatives like digital retailing tools.\n\nIn summary, TrueCar's results in 2020 were significantly affected by COVID-19 and the end of the USAA partnership, but the company saw some offsetting increases in areas like monthly visitors and adjusted EBITDA. Performance is expected to continue to be impacted by the pandemic in 2021."}
