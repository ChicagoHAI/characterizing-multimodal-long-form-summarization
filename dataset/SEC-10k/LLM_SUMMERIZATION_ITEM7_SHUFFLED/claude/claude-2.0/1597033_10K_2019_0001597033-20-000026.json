MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a comparison of our Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and our Cash Flow discussion for the year ended December 31, 2017, see \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC on February 15, 2019.\nOverview\nWe connect people and places with technology that reimagines the business of travel. We operate through three business segments: (i) Travel Network, our global business-to-business travel marketplace for travel suppliers and travel buyers, (ii) Airline Solutions, a broad portfolio of software technology products and solutions primarily for airlines, and (iii) Hospitality Solutions, an extensive suite of leading software solutions for hoteliers. Collectively, these offerings enable travel suppliers to better serve their customers across the entire travel lifecycle, from route planning to post-trip business intelligence and analytics.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated through transaction based fees that we charge to our customers. For Travel Network, this fee is in the form of a transaction fee for bookings on our GDS; for Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions, this fee is a recurring usage-based fee for the use of our SaaS and hosted systems, as well as upfront fees and professional service fees. Items that are not allocated to our business segments are identified as corporate and primarily include stock-based compensation expense, litigation costs, corporate headcount-related costs and other items that are not identifiable with either one of our segments.\nRecent Developments Affecting our Results of Operations\nThe travel industry continues to be adversely affected by the global health crisis due to the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, especially as it relates to air travel to and from Asia. We expect a material impact to our consolidated financial results in the first quarter of 2020. Given the uncertainties surrounding the duration of the outbreak and its impact on global travel, we cannot reasonably estimate the related financial impact to our full-year 2020 financial results; however, we expect the impact will be material.\nIn 2019, we substantially completed our transition to utilizing the agile development methodology. This method is characterized by a more dynamic development process with iterative activities that involve planning, designing, coding and testing. The agile approach results in more frequent and incremental revisions to software and releases with shorter development cycles that may be less likely to meet the criteria for capitalization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). In addition, we continue to focus our resources on re-platforming efforts as we continue to move to open source and cloud-based solutions. As expected, these continued investments have reduced our capitalization of certain costs, with a corresponding increase in technology operating expenses.\nIn April 2019, a customer of Travel Network and Airline Solutions, Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (\"Jet Airways\"), suspended flight operations and is now in insolvency proceedings. Our revenue was negatively impacted in 2019, and this negative impact will continue in 2020. This insolvency, coupled with the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and channel shift related to certain European carriers, has negatively impacted our revenue growth and contributed to reduced growth rates in the GDS industry. We expect this trend to persist into 2020. In addition, our revenue was negatively impacted in 2019 from the effects of the 737 MAX incident on one particular carrier, and we expect this negative impact will continue in 2020. Finally, for Airline Solutions, Pakistan International Airlines Corporation, Bangkok Airways Public Company Limited, and Philippine Airlines, Inc. (the \"Transitioned Customers\"), previously made decisions in 2018 to transition from our services, which will dilute our growth rates on a year-over-year basis. Pakistan International Airlines, Philippine Airlines, and Bangkok Airways Public Company Limited transitioned in September 2018, March 2019, and August 2019, respectively.\nOn October 15, 2019, we acquired Radixx, a leading airline retailing software provider for $110 million, utilizing cash on hand. Radixx is being integrated and is managed as a part of our Airline Solutions segment.\nWe announced on November 14, 2018 that we have entered into an agreement to purchase Farelogix, a travel industry innovator in the airline information technology and distribution landscape for $360 million, which will be funded at closing by cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolver. On August 20, 2019, the DOJ filed a complaint seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the acquisition. The trial concluded on February 6, 2020 and the trial court has not yet issued its decision. In addition, the CMA has referred its review of the acquisition for a Phase 2 investigation and has published its provisional findings of competition concerns. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. There can be no assurance that the acquisition will occur on these terms or at all. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant fees associated with this acquisition, including for the items discussed above, which are included in general and administrative expense.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the comprehensive update to revenue recognition guidance for Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\"), which replaced the previous standard (\"ASC 605\"), using the modified retrospective approach. Under the updated standard, revenue is recognized when a company transfers the promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods and services. See Note 2.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, to our consolidated financial statements for more information on impacts of ASC 606 to our various streams of revenue recognition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded final adjustments to our provisional amounts recognized related to the TCJA, resulting in a decrease in our provision for income taxes from continuing operations of $27 million for deferred tax assets and foreign tax effects (see Note 7. Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements).\nFactors Affecting our Results\nThe following is a discussion of trends that we believe are the most significant opportunities and challenges currently impacting our business and industry. The discussion also includes management's assessment of the effects these trends have had and are expected to have on our results of continuing operations. This information is not an exhaustive list of all of the factors that could affect our results and should be read in conjunction with the factors referred to in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTechnology transformation and change in mix of technology spend\nWe expect to further enable our technology transformation with incremental investments of approximately $150 million in 2020 and continued investment over the next few years which will have a material impact on our financial results. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our re-platforming efforts to open source and cloud-based solutions, as previously disclosed, with the goal of modernizing our architecture, driving efficiency in development and ongoing technology costs, further enhancing the stability and security of our network, and complying with data privacy regulations, and in next-generation retailing capabilities, including NDC and personalized offers, LCC, and full-service hotel PMS offerings. In 2020, we expect total capital expenditures to range from $80 million to $120 million.\nUpon completion of our technology transformation in 2024, we expect to benefit from lower cloud infrastructure costs and higher margins. We believe that continued investment in our technology will help to provide us the necessary framework and infrastructure for a secure and stable architecture for our customers, grow our addressable market, provide new revenue opportunities, reduce costs and will help to improve sales of our software solutions. However, there are various risks associated with our technology transformation efforts, including not achieving the amount of anticipated cost savings, not completing the steps during their current projected time frame, or changing the approach leading to, among other things, additional changes in our mix of technology spend between operating expense and capitalization.\nIncreasing travel agency incentive consideration\nTravel agency incentive consideration is a large portion of Travel Network expenses. The vast majority of incentive consideration is tied to absolute booking volumes based on transactions such as flight segments booked. Incentive consideration, which often increases once a certain volume or percentage of bookings is met, is provided in two ways, according to the terms of the agreement: (i) on a periodic basis over the term of the contract and (ii) in some instances, up front at the inception or modification of contracts, which is capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the contract.\nThis consideration grew in the double digits on a per booking basis in 2017 and 2018 due to higher incentives in certain geographical markets and from new customer conversions and reverted to single-digit growth in 2019. We expect continued single-digit growth in the near term due to our focus on managing incentive consideration. Although incentive rate increases may continue to impact margins, we expect these increases to be more than offset by growth in Travel Network revenue. This expectation is based in part on our continuing to offer value added services and content to travel buyers, such as the Sabre Red Workspace, a SaaS product that provides a simplified interface and enhanced travel agency workflow and productivity tools.\nShift to SaaS and hosted solutions by airlines and hotels to manage their daily operations\nHistorically, large travel suppliers built custom in-house software and applications for their business process needs. In response to a desire for more flexible systems given increasingly complex and constantly changing technological requirements, reduced IT budgets and increased focus on cost efficiency, many travel suppliers turned to third party solutions providers for many of their key technologies and began to license software from software providers. We believe that significant revenue opportunity remains in this outsourcing trend, as legacy in-house systems continue to migrate and upgrade to third party systems. The shift from a model with initial license fees to one with recurring monthly fees associated with our SaaS and hosted solutions, has resulted in an ongoing revenue stream based on the number of passengers boarded. However, under the SaaS and hosted solutions revenue model, revenue recognition may be delayed due to longer implementation schedules for larger suppliers. The SaaS and hosted models' centralized deployment also allows us to save time and money by reducing maintenance and implementation tasks and lowering operating costs.\nRecent insolvencies of certain Airline Solutions customers\nIn April 2019, a customer of Travel Network and Airline Solutions, Jet Airways suspended flight operations and is now in insolvency proceedings. Our revenue was negatively impacted in 2019 which will continue in 2020.\nIn addition, future revenues may be negatively impacted by, among other things, reduced sales of our software solutions and lower growth in Passengers Boarded due to delayed or uncertain implementations and insolvencies of airline carriers, such as Alitalia Compagnia Aerea Italiana S.p.A. operating as Alitalia ( Alitalia\u201d), that implemented our services in the fourth quarter of\n2016. See Risk Factors-Our travel supplier customers may experience financial instability or consolidation, pursue cost reductions, change their distribution model or undergo other changes.\u201d\nGrowing demand for continued technology improvements in the fragmented hotel market\nMost of the hotel market is highly fragmented. Independent hotels and small to medium sized chains (groups of less than 300 properties) comprise a majority of hotel properties and available hotel rooms, with global and regional chains comprising the balance. Hotels use a number of different technology systems to distribute and market their products and operate efficiently. We offer technology solutions to all segments of the hospitality market. Our SynXis Enterprise Platform integrates critical hospitality systems to optimize distribution, operations, retailing and guest experience via one scalable, flexible and intelligent platform. As these markets continue to grow, we believe both independent and enterprise hotel owners and operators will continue to seek increased connectivity and integrated solutions to ensure access to global travelers. We anticipate that this will contribute to the continued growth of Hospitality Solutions, which is ultimately dependent upon these hoteliers accepting and utilizing our products and services.\nImpact of customer consolidation in Hospitality Solutions\nGrowth through acquisition and brand consolidation is emerging as a strategy for enterprise hoteliers. This has resulted, and may continue to result, in customer de-migration as larger hotel chains consolidate acquired brands onto their existing technology platforms. Certain of our Hospitality Solutions customers are in the process of being acquired by larger hoteliers, and it is possible that additional customer consolidations could occur in the future. We expect these consolidations to adversely impact revenue growth for the Hospitality Solutions business.\nGeographic mix of Travel Network\nThere are structural differences between the geographies in which we operate. Due to our geographic concentration, our results of operations are particularly sensitive to factors affecting North America. For example, booking fees per transaction in North America have traditionally been lower than those in Europe. By growing internationally with our TMCs and OTAs customers and expanding the travel content available on our GDS to target regional traveler preferences, we anticipate that we will grow share in North America, Europe and Latin America. We invest for sustainable share growth, and in certain parts of Asia-Pacific and Latin America, our share may be impacted by travel agency deals we have declined to pursue due to credit risk and unfavorable economics. The geographic mix of our Direct Billable Bookings is summarized below:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct Billable Bookings (1):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America </td> <td>55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>APAC </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Direct Billable Bookings\u201d is the primary metric utilized by Travel Network to measure operating performance and includes bookings made through our GDS and through our joint venture partners in cases where we are paid directly by the travel supplier.\nTravel buyers can shift their bookings to or from our Travel Network business\nOur Travel Network business relies on relationships with several large travel buyers, including TMCs and OTAs, to drive a large portion of its revenue. Although our contracts with larger travel agencies often increase the amount of the incentive consideration when the travel agency processes a certain volume or percentage of its bookings through our GDS, travel buyers are not contractually required to book exclusively through our GDS during the contract term. Travel buyers may shift bookings to other distribution intermediaries for many reasons, including to avoid becoming overly dependent on a single source of travel content and increase their bargaining power with the GDS providers. For example, certain travel agencies have adopted a dual GDS provider strategy and shifted a sizeable portion of their business from our GDS to a competitor GDS, while other agencies have shifted a sizable portion their business to our GDS.\nIncreasing importance of LCC/hybrids\nLow-cost carriers and hybrid carriers (\"LCC/hybrids\") have become a significant segment of the air travel market, stimulating demand for air travel through low fares. LCC/hybrids have traditionally relied on direct distribution for the majority of their bookings. However, as these LCC/hybrids are evolving, many are increasing their distribution through indirect channels to expand their offering into higher yield markets and to higher yield customers, such as business and international travelers. Other LCC/hybrids, especially start up carriers, may choose not to distribute through the GDS until wider distribution is desired. On October 15, 2019, we acquired Radixx, an airline retailing software provider whose signature products are a LCC passenger service system and internet booking engine. We expect to make additional investments to address the LCC space.\nContinued focus by travel suppliers on cost cutting and exerting influence over distribution\nTravel suppliers continue to look for ways to decrease their costs and to increase their control over distribution. Airline consolidations, pricing pressure during contract renegotiations and the use of direct distribution may continue to subject our business to challenges. The shift from indirect distribution channels, such as our GDS, to direct distribution channels, may result from increased content availability on supplier operated websites or from increased participation of meta search engines, such as Kayak and Google, which direct consumers to supplier operated websites. This trend may adversely affect our Travel Network contract renegotiations with suppliers that use alternative distribution channels. For example, airlines may withhold part of their content for distribution exclusively through their own direct distribution channels or offer more attractive terms for content available through those direct channels. This occurred in 2018 when certain European carriers began to withhold part of their content from our GDS to make use of alternative distribution channels, which may adversely affect our future revenue growth. However, in North America, which is our largest region, the rate at which bookings have shifted from indirect to direct distribution channels has been relatively consistent for a number of reasons, including the increased participation of LCC/hybrids in direct channels. Over the last several years, notable carriers that previously only distributed directly, including JetBlue, Norwegian and Interjet, have adopted our GDS. Other carriers such as EVA Airways, and Virgin Australia have further increased their participation in a GDS. Conversely, Air India, Ltd. fully migrated from our GDS during 2019.\nThese trends have impacted the revenue of Travel Network, which recognizes revenue for airline ticket sales based on transaction volumes. Simultaneously, this focus on cost cutting and direct distribution has also presented opportunities for Airline Solutions. Many airlines have turned to outside providers for key systems, process and industry expertise and other products that assist in their cost cutting initiatives in order to focus on their primary revenue generating activities.\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\nRevenues\nTravel Network primarily generates revenues from Direct Billable Bookings processed on our GDS as well as the sale of aggregated bookings data to carriers. Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions primarily generate revenue through upfront solution fees and recurring usage-based fees for the use of our software solutions hosted on secure platforms or deployed through our SaaS and through other professional service fees including Digital Experience (\"DX\"). Certain professional service fees are discrete sales opportunities that may have a high degree of variability from period to period, and we cannot guarantee that we will have such fees in the future consistent with prior periods. Airline Solutions also generates revenue through software licensing and maintenance fees. Recognition of license fees upon delivery has previously resulted and will continue to result in periodic fluctuations in revenue recognized.\nIn connection with the adoption of ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018, Airline Solutions license fees are recognized upon delivery, while ongoing maintenance services are recognized ratably over the life of the contract. In addition, the allocation of contract revenues among various products and solutions, and the timing of the recognition of those revenues, may be impacted by agreements with tiered pricing or variable rate structures that do not correspond with the goods or services delivered to the customer. See Note 2. Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to our consolidated financial statements, and \"-Recent Developments Affecting our Results of Operations\" above. Revenue may occasionally include amounts from transactions that were partially or fully satisfied in previous periods, but recognized upon the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the amounts involved or changes in estimates.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue incurred by Travel Network, Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions consists of expenses related to technology operations including hosting, third-party software and expensed research and development labor costs, other salaries and benefits, and allocated overhead such as facilities and other support costs. Cost of revenue for Travel Network also includes incentive consideration expense representing payments or other consideration to travel agencies for reservations made on our GDS which accrue on a monthly basis.\nCorporate cost of revenue includes expenses associated with our technology organization such as corporate systems and risk and security. Corporate cost of revenue also includes certain expenses such as stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, legal reserves and other items not identifiable with one of our segments.\nDepreciation and amortization included in cost of revenue is associated with property and equipment, amortization of capitalized implementation costs which relates to Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions, intangible assets for technology purchased through acquisitions or established with our take private transaction in 2007, and software developed for internal use that supports our revenue, businesses and systems. Cost of revenue also includes amortization of upfront incentive consideration representing upfront payments or other consideration provided to travel agencies for reservations made on our GDS which are capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the contract.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that sell our services to new customers and administratively support the business, information technology and communication costs, professional service fees, certain settlement charges or reimbursements, costs to defend legal disputes, bad debt expense, depreciation and amortization and other overhead costs.\nIntersegment Transactions\nWe account for significant intersegment transactions as if the transactions were with third parties, that is, at estimated current market prices. Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions pay fees to Travel Network for airline trips and hotel stays booked through our GDS.\nKey Metrics\nDirect Billable Bookings\u201d and Passengers Boarded\u201d are the primary metrics utilized by Travel Network and Airline Solutions, respectively, to measure operating performance. Travel Network generates fees for each Direct Billable Booking which include bookings made through our GDS (e.g., Air, and Lodging, Ground and Sea (\"LGS\")) and through our joint venture partners in cases where we are paid directly by the travel supplier. Passengers Boarded ( PBs\u201d) is the primary metric used by Airline Solutions to recognize SaaS and hosted revenue from recurring usage-based fees. The primary metric utilized by Hospitality Solutions is booking transactions processed through the SynXis Central Reservations System. These key metrics allow management to analyze customer volume over time for each of our three business segments to monitor industry trends and analyze performance. We believe that these key metrics are useful for investors and other third parties as indicators of our financial performance and industry trends. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our transaction counts for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges associated with their measurement. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of these metrics, and these estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology.\nThe following table sets forth these key metrics for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The increase in revenue primarily resulted from a 1% increase in Direct Billable Bookings to 566 million and growth in the average booking fee rate during the year ended December 31, 2019 due to a discrete shift in the distribution pricing structure for specific European carriers and favorable mix primarily resulting from growth in hotel bookings which have a higher rate.\nAirline Solutions-Revenue increased $18 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The $18 million increase in revenue primarily resulted from:\n\u2022a $13 million increase in AirVision and AirCentre commercial and operations solutions revenue primarily driven by license fee revenue from new implementations recognized upon delivery to the customer as well as an increase in revenue related to services and new implementations; and\n\u2022a $5 million increase in Reservation revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily driven by the acquisition of Radixx and organic growth in our existing customer base. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the volume of Passengers Boarded, which declined 2% to 741 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by the demigration of the Transitioned Customers as well as the impact of Jet Airways' insolvency and the impact of the 737 Max incident on a particular customer.\nHospitality Solutions-Revenue increased $20 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by growth in SynXis Software and Services Revenue of $17 million, or 7%, due to an increase in transaction volumes of 22% to 108 million, which includes the migration of certain brands of Wyndham Hotels over the first half of 2018 and early 2019. The migration of these enterprise hotel brands reduced the average rate of our transaction revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 versus the prior year. Additionally, DX service revenue increased $3 million.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel Network </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,865,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,708,142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Airline Solutions </td> <td>513,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>467,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,061 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hospitality Solutions </td> <td>228,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,291 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations </td> <td>(40,879) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,065) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,814) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment cost of revenue </td> <td>2,566,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,330,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td>44,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>340,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>341,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(764) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of upfront incentive consideration </td> <td>82,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,035,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,791,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTravel Network-Cost of revenue increased $158 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, partially as a result of a $71 million increase in incentive consideration primarily due to volume growth in North America bookings as well as rate increases across all regions. The increase is also driven by a $69 million increase in labor costs and a $19 million increase in technology expenditures, both driven by the execution of our technology strategy, including cloud migration, mainframe offload and utilization of agile development methods, which increases the expensed portion of our total technology spend.\nAirline Solutions-Cost of revenue increased $46 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily a result of a $62 million increase in labor costs and a $7 million increase in technology expenditures, both driven by the execution of our technology strategy, including cloud migration, mainframe offload and utilization of agile development methods, which increases the expensed portion of our total technology spend. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in non-development labor costs and benefits-related costs of $23 million.\nHospitality Solutions-Cost of revenue increased $38 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a $28 million increase in labor costs and a $4 million increase in technology expenditures, both driven by the execution of our technology strategy, including cloud migration, mainframe offload and utilization of agile development methods, which increases the expensed portion of our total technology spend. Additionally, transaction-related costs increased by $14 million to support the growth of our business. These increases were partially offset by an $8 million reduction in non-development labor costs.\nCorporate-Cost of revenue associated with corporate costs increased $3 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in labor costs resulting from the shift to open source and cloud-based solutions as well as an increase in non-development headcount-related expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization-Depreciation and amortization decreased $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to customer implementations that became fully amortized during the year, partially offset by additional depreciation related to the completion of software developed for internal use.\nAmortization of upfront incentive consideration-Amortization of upfront incentive consideration increased $5 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in upfront consideration provided to travel agencies.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>$ </td> <td>576,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>513,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $63 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in our legal costs associated with the potential acquisition of Farelogix of $41 million, an increase in labor costs of $24 million, an increase in technology costs of $14 million related to strategic investments in cybersecurity and corporate systems, an increase in bad debt expense of $13 million, and an increase in other antitrust litigation expenses of $3 million. The increase was partially offset by the reversal of our previously accrued loss related to the US Airways legal matter for $32 million. See Note 16.

The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to the impact of 2018 adjustments related to the enactment of the TCJA for deferred taxes and foreign tax effects of $27 million and, in 2019, an unfavorable impact of our geographic mix of taxable income, partially offset by an increase in net favorable U.S. tax permanent differences and certain tax credits and incentives.\nThe differences between our effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily resulted from our geographic mix of taxable income in various tax jurisdictions, tax permanent differences and tax credits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are: (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) cash and cash equivalents and (iii) borrowings under our $400 million Revolver (see -Senior Secured Credit Facilities \u201d). Borrowing availability under our Revolver is reduced by our outstanding letters of credit and restricted cash collateral. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our cash and cash equivalents, Revolver and outstanding letters of credit were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>436,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>509,265 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available balance under the Revolver </td> <td>388,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>385,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reductions to the Revolver: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver outstanding balance </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding letters of credit </td> <td>11,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,665 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe consider cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash. Securities with contractual maturities of three months or less, when purchased, are considered cash equivalents. We record changes in a book overdraft position, in which our bank account is not overdrawn but recently issued and outstanding checks result in a negative general ledger balance, as cash flows from financing activities. We invest in a money market fund which is classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows. We held no short-term investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAs a result of the enactment of the TCJA, we recorded a one-time transition tax on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We do not consider these undistributed earnings to be indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2019, with certain limited exceptions. We consider the undistributed capital investments in our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2019, and have not provided deferred taxes on any outside basis differences. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries are available to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.\nLiquidity Outlook\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, share repurchases, and dividends will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. See Risk Factors-We may require more cash than we generate in our operating activities, and additional funding on reasonable terms or at all may not be available.\u201d\nWe utilize cash and cash equivalents, supplemented by our Revolver, primarily to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, invest in our information technology infrastructure, products and offerings, pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, make payments under the TRA, pay taxes, and service our debt and other long-term liabilities. On October 15, 2019, we acquired Radixx for $110 million utilizing cash on hand. In addition, we have entered into an agreement to purchase Farelogix for $360 million, which will be funded at closing by cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolver. Under the acquisition agreement, as amended, we have agreed to advance certain attorneys' fees incurred by Farelogix in responding to certain governmental reviews of the acquisition and in defending against certain antitrust proceedings, which have totaled $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These advances will be applied against the purchase price upon closing. The acquisition agreement, as amended, contains certain customary termination rights, including the right of either party to terminate the acquisition agreement if the acquisition has not occurred by April 30, 2020. We could be obligated to pay Farelogix up to an additional $25 million, either in the form of additional advances or in the form of a termination fee depending on the circumstances.\nFurthermore, on an ongoing basis, we will evaluate and consider strategic acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, repurchasing shares of our common stock (including pursuant to our multi-year $500 million share repurchase program (the \"Share Repurchase Program\")) or our outstanding debt obligations in open market or in privately negotiated transactions, as well as other transactions we believe may create stockholder value or enhance financial performance. These transactions may require cash expenditures or generate proceeds and, to the extent they require cash expenditures, may be funded through a combination of cash on hand, debt or equity offerings, or utilization of our Revolver.\nWe believe that cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand and our Revolver provide adequate liquidity for our operational and capital expenditures and other obligations over the next twelve months, as well as funding our acquisition of Farelogix. We are reviewing opportunities to refinance Term Loan A, Term Loan B, and our Revolver, depending on market conditions. This refinancing may include a debt issuance, a reallocation between Term Loan A and Term Loan B and an extension of the maturity date of Term Loan A and our revolver. We may supplement our current liquidity through debt or equity offerings to support future strategic investments, or to pay down debt including debt offerings to pay down a portion of our outstanding debt. We funded TRA payments of $72 million, $74 million, and $60 million, including interest, due in January 2020, January 2019 and January 2018, respectively, with cash on hand.\nAs of December 31, 2018 we have utilized substantially all of our U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and a portion of our available U.S. federal tax credits. As a result, we expect an increase in the amount of our cash taxes in future years, beginning in 2020.\nDividends\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock totaling $154 million and expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends thereafter. Our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.14 per share of our common stock, which will be paid on March 30, 2020 to stockholders of record as of March 20, 2020. We funded the 2019 dividends, and intend to fund any future dividends, from cash generated from our operations. Future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and the amount of cash dividends per share will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions, number of shares of common stock outstanding and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant. The timing and amount of future dividend payments will be at the discretion of our board of directors. See Risk Factors-Our ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of Delaware law.\u201d\nRecent Events Impacting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\nTerm Facility Amendment\nOn March 2, 2018, Sabre GLBL entered into a Fifth Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to refinance and modify the terms of the Term Loan B, resulting in a reduction of the applicable margins for the Term Loan B to 2.00% per annum for Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.00% per annum for base rate loans. We incurred no additional indebtedness as a result of this transaction and incurred $2 million in financing fees recorded within Other, net and a $1 million loss extinguishment of debt in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSecondary Public Offerings\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, certain of our stockholders sold an aggregate of 69,304,636 shares of our common stock through secondary public offerings. We did not offer any shares or receive any proceeds from these secondary public offerings. Following the secondary public offering of approximately 23,304,636 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter of 2018, stockholders affiliated with TPG Global, LLC (\"TPG\") and Silver Lake Management Company II, L.L.C. (\"Silver Lake\") no longer held any shares of our common stock.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn February 2017, our Board approved a $500 million multi-year Share Repurchase Program. Repurchases under the program may take place in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Approximately $287 million remains authorized for repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 3,673,768 shares totaling $78 million pursuant to this Share Repurchase Program. There were no shares repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nIn February 2013, Sabre GLBL entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The agreement replaced (i) the existing term loans with new classes of term loans of $1,775 million (the 2013 Term Loan B\u201d) and $425 million (the 2013 Term Loan C\u201d) and (ii) the existing revolving credit facility with a new revolving credit facility of $352 million (the 2013 Revolver\u201d). In September 2013, Sabre GLBL entered into an agreement to amend the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to add a new class of term loans in the amount of $350 million (the 2013 Incremental Term Loan Facility\u201d).\nIn July 2016, Sabre GLBL entered into a series of amendments (the Credit Agreement Amendments\u201d) to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to provide for an incremental term loan under a new class with an aggregate principal amount of $600 million (the 2016 Term Loan A\u201d) and to replace the 2013 Revolver with a new revolving credit facility totaling $400 million (the 2016 Revolver\u201d). The proceeds of $597 million, net of $3 million discount, from the 2016 Term Loan A were used to repay $350 million of outstanding principal on our 2013 Term Loan B and 2013 Incremental Term Loan Facility, on a pro rata basis, repay the $120 million then-outstanding balance on the 2016 Revolver, and pay $11 million in associated financing fees. We recognized a $4 million loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with these transactions during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn February 22, 2017, Sabre GLBL entered into a Third Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2017 Term Facility Amendment\u201d). The new agreement replaced the 2013 Term Loan B, 2013 Term Loan C, and 2013 Incremental Term Loan Facility with a single class of term loan (the \"2017 Term Loan B\") with an aggregate principal amount of $1,900 million maturing on February 22, 2024. The proceeds of $1,898 million, net of $2 million discount on the 2017 Term Loan B, were used to pay off approximately $1,761 million of all existing classes of outstanding term loans (other than the 2016 Term Loan A), pay related accrued interest and pay $12 million in associated financing fees, which were recorded as debt modification costs in Other, net in the consolidated statement of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The remaining proceeds of the 2017 Term Loan B were used to pay off approximately $80 million of Sabre's outstanding mortgage on its corporate headquarters on March 31, 2017 and for other general corporate purposes. Unamortized debt issuance costs and discount related to existing classes of outstanding term loans prior to the 2017 Term\nFacility Amendment of $9 million and $3 million, respectively, will continue to be amortized over the remaining term of the 2017 Term Loan B along with the Term Loan B discount of $2 million. See Note 9. Derivatives, to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the discontinuation of hedge accounting related to our existing interest rate swaps as a result of the 2017 Term Facility Amendment.\nOn August 23, 2017, Sabre GLBL entered into a Fourth Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, Term Loan A Refinancing Amendment to the Credit Agreement, and Second Revolving Facility Refinancing Amendment to the Credit Agreement to refinance and modify the terms of the 2017 Term Loan B, the 2016 Term Loan A, and the 2016 Revolver, resulting in a reduction of the applicable margins for each of these instruments and approximately a one-year extension of the maturity of the 2016 Term Loan A and 2016 Revolver (the 2017 Refinancing\u201d). We incurred no additional indebtedness as a result of the 2017 Refinancing. The 2017 Refinancing included a $400 million revolving credit facility (\"Revolver\") that replaced the 2016 Revolver, as well as the application of the proceeds of the approximately $1,891 million incremental Term Loan B facility ( Term Loan B\u201d) and $570 million Term Loan A facility ( Term Loan A\u201d) to replace the 2017 Term Loan B and the 2016 Term Loan A. The maturity of the Revolver and the Term Loan A was extended from July 18, 2021 to July 1, 2022. The applicable margins for the Term Loan B were reduced to 2.25% per annum for Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.25% per annum for base rate loans. The applicable margins for the Term Loan A and the Revolver were reduced to (i) between 2.50% and 1.75% per annum for Eurocurrency rate loans and (ii) between 1.50% and 0.75% per annum for base rate loans, in each case with the applicable margin for any quarter reduced by 25 basis points (up to 75 basis points total) if the Senior Secured First-Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) is less than 3.75 to 1.0, 3.00 to 1.0, or 2.25 to 1.0, respectively. The Eurocurrency rate is based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. If a published U.S. dollar LIBOR rate is unavailable, the interest rates on our debt indexed to LIBOR will be determined using various alternative methods set forth in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, any of which could result in interest obligations that are more than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on this debt if U.S. dollar LIBOR were available in its current form. See Risk Factors-We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations.\u201d We anticipate amending our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement prior to the phaseout of LIBOR to provide for a Eurocurrency rate alternative to LIBOR.\nOn March 2, 2018, Sabre GLBL entered into a Fifth Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to refinance and modify the terms of the Term Loan B as discussed above. See \"-Recent Events Impacting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" above.\nWe had no balance outstanding under the Revolver as of December 31, 2019 and as of December 31, 2018. We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $12 million and $15 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which reduced our overall credit capacity under the Revolver.\nUnder the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the loan parties are subject to certain customary non-financial covenants, including certain restrictions on incurring certain types of indebtedness, creation of liens on certain assets, making of certain investments, and payment of dividends, as well as a maximum leverage ratio. Pursuant to Credit Agreement Amendments, effective July 18, 2016, the maximum leverage ratio has been adjusted to be based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) and we are required, at all times (no longer solely when a threshold amount of revolving loans or letters of credit were outstanding), to maintain a Total Net Leverage Ratio of less than 4.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2019 we are in compliance with all covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nWe are also required to pay down the term loans by an amount equal to 50% of annual excess cash flow, as defined in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. This percentage requirement may decrease or be eliminated if certain leverage ratios are achieved. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2018, we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment in 2019, and no excess cash flow payment was required in 2020 with respect to our results for the year ended December 31, 2019. We are further required to pay down the term loan with proceeds from certain asset sales or borrowings as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nImmediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering, we entered into the TRA that provides the stockholders and equity award holders that were our stockholders and equity award holders, respectively, immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering (collectively, the \"Pre-IPO Existing Stockholders\") the right to receive future payments from us equal to 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal income tax that we and our subsidiaries realize as a result of the utilization of certain tax assets attributable to periods prior to our initial public offerings, including NOLs, capital losses and the ability to realize tax amortization of certain intangible assets (collectively, the \"Pre-IPO Tax Assets\"). In connection with the TRA, we made payments, including interest, of $72 million in January 2020, $30 million in April 2019, and $74 million, $60 million and $101 million in January 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In December 2019, we exercised our right under the terms of the TRA to accelerate our remaining payments under the TRA and make an early termination payment of $1 million, to the Pre-IPO Existing Shareholders, which was included in the January 2020 payment of $72 million described above. As a result, no future payments are required to be made to the Pre-IPO Existing Stockholders under the TRA.\nTechnology Expenditures\nWe maintain and make enhancements to our products, services, technologies and systems in response to technological developments, industry standards, trends, and customer demands. We deploy resources in research and development in order to help maintain a competitive advantage and deliver innovation to the marketplace. Software developed for internal use includes costs incurred to enhance our infrastructure, software applications, and reservation systems. Additionally, we rely on other third-party providers, including DXC, Amazon Web Services, Inc., Google Cloud, and Microsoft Corporation, to operate computer data centers and network systems and provide hosting services. The aggregation of these costs represents our total technology expenditures of $1,034 million, $999 million, and $940 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. These amounts include hosting, third-party software and expensed research and development costs of $945 million, $744 million, and $675 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and capitalized software development expenditures of $89 million, $256 million, and $264 million for these respective periods. This definition of total technology expenditures does not include computer equipment or other property, plant, and equipment. See \"Factors Affecting Our Results-Technology transformation and change in mix of technology spend.\"\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $581 million and consisted of net income from continuing operations of $164 million, adjustments for non-cash and other items of $568 million and a decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $151 million. The adjustments for non-cash and other items consist primarily of $415 million of depreciation and amortization, $83 million in amortization of upfront incentive consideration, $67 million of stock-based compensation expense, $23 million of deferred income taxes, and $21 million allowance for doubtful accounts. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $151 million was primarily the result of $71 million used for upfront incentive consideration, $34 million increase in accounts receivable, $29 million used for capitalized implementation costs, $27 million decrease in accounts payable, $17 million decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits, and a $12 million decrease in deferred revenues. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease of $39 million in other assets and a decrease of $1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $725 million and consisted of net income from continuing operations of $341 million, adjustments for non-cash and other items of $607 million and a decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $223 million. The adjustments for non-cash and other items consist primarily of $413 million of depreciation and amortization, $78 million in amortization of upfront incentive consideration, $57 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $43 million of deferred income taxes. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $223 million was primarily the result of $89 million used for upfront incentive consideration, a $75 million increase in accounts receivable, $39 million used for capitalized implementation costs, a $30 million increase in other assets, a $27 million decrease in accounts payable, and a $15 million decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits. These decreases were partially offset by the receipt of $29 million from an insurance settlement, an increase of $8 million in deferred revenues, and a decrease of $14 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash of $243 million in investing activities, including $107 million used in the acquisition of Radixx, net of cash acquired, and $89 million related to software developed for internal use. Additionally, we used cash of $20 million as an advance of purchase price to Farelogix for certain attorneys' fees. See \"-Liquidity Outlook\" above for additional information on the Farelogix acquisition agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we used cash of $284 million on capital expenditures, which includes capitalized software development of $256 million, consisting of $252 million related to software developed for internal use and $4 million for development of on-premise licensed products.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we used $410 million for financing activities. Significant highlights of our financing activities included:\n\u2022payment of $154 million in dividends on our common stock;\n\u2022payment of $45 million on our revolving credit facility and $62 million on our Term Loan A and Term Loan B, offset by proceeds of $45 million from borrowings on our revolving credit facility;\n\u2022annual payment on the TRA liability for $101 million, excluding interest;\n\u2022repurchase of 3,673,768 shares of our common stock outstanding totaling $78 million; and\n\u2022net payments of $6 million from the settlement of employee stock-based awards, including $7 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, net of payments for $13 million in income tax withholdings associated with the settlement of employee stock-based awards.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we used $307 million for financing activities. Significant highlights of our financing activities included:\n\u2022payment of $154 million in dividends on our common stock;\n\u2022second annual payment in January 2018 on the TRA liability for $59 million, excluding interest;\n\u2022payment of $47 million on our Term Loan A and Term Loan B and $2 million in debt issuance and modification costs;\n\u2022repurchase of 1,075,255 shares of our common stock outstanding totaling $26 million; and\n\u2022receipt of net proceeds totaling $2 million from the settlement of employee stock-option awards, including a payment of $10 million in income tax withholdings associated with the settlement of employee restricted-stock awards.\nDiscontinued Travelocity Business\nCash flows used in discontinued operating activities were $2 million, $2 million, and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cash flows used by discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, primarily resulted from expenses associated with legal contingencies related to hotel occupancy taxes.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>228,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>218,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>515,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,154,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,777,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,895,435 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>26,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124,003 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IT outsourcing agreement(3)\n</td> <td>139,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,500,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,230,607 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(4)\n</td> <td>187,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>347,038 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit(5)\n</td> <td>7,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,604 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits(6)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,933 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax Receivable Agreement(7)\n</td> <td>71,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,958 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations(8)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>661,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>417,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>680,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,546,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,806,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,648,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,761,578 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________\n(1)Includes all interest and principal of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, senior secured notes due 2023 and finance lease obligations. Under certain circumstances, we are required to pay a percentage of the excess cash flow, if any, generated each year to our lenders which obligation is not reflected in the table above. Interest on the term loan is based on the LIBOR rate plus a base margin and includes the effect of interest rate swaps. For purposes of this table, we have used projected LIBOR rates for all future periods. See Note 8. Debt, to our consolidated financial statements.\n(2)We lease approximately 1.6 million square feet of office space in 93 locations in 48 countries. Lease payment escalations are based on fixed annual increases, local consumer price index changes or market rental reviews. We have renewal options of various term lengths in approximately 50 leases. We have no purchase options and no restrictions imposed by our leases concerning dividends or additional debt. Also includes future minimum payment obligations for an operating lease commencing in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 11. Leases to our consolidated financial statements.\n(3)Represents minimum amounts due to DXC under the terms of an outsourcing agreement through which DXC manages a significant portion of our information technology systems. Also reflects minimum amounts due under an information technology agreement entered into during the first quarter of 2020. Actual payments may vary significantly from the minimum amounts presented.\n(4)Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of December 31, 2019. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.\n(5)Our letters of credit consist of stand-by letters of credit, underwritten by a group of lenders, which we primarily issue in the normal course of business. The contractual expiration dates of these letters of credit are shown in the table above. There were no claims made against any standby letters of credit during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n(6)Unrecognized tax benefits include associated interest and penalties. The timing of related cash payments for substantially all of these liabilities is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control.\n(7)We made payments, including interest, of $72 million in January 2020. See Note 7. Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources-Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d\n(8)Excludes pension obligations, see Note 15. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans, to our consolidated financial statements.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation related to Recent Accounting Pronouncements is included in Note 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates, and our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary under different assumptions and conditions. In addition, our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard.\nOur accounting policies that include significant estimates and assumptions include: (i) estimation for revenue recognition and multiple performance obligation arrangements, (ii) determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, (iii) the evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and goodwill, (iv) assumptions utilized to test recoverability of capitalized implementation costs, (v) judgments in capitalization of software developed for internal use, and (vi) the evaluation of uncertainties surrounding the calculation of our tax assets and liabilities. We regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate\u201d if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation and if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur and could have a material effect on the presentation of financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe have included below a discussion of the accounting policies involving material estimates and assumptions that we believe are most critical to the preparation of our financial statements, how we apply such policies and how results differing from our estimates and assumptions would affect the amounts presented in our financial statements. We have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these accounting policies with our Audit Committee. Although we believe these policies to be the most critical, other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements and certain of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions. For further information about our significant accounting policies, see Note 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Multiple Performance Obligation Arrangements\nOur agreements with customers of our Airline Solutions business may have multiple performance obligations which generally include software solutions through SaaS and hosted delivery, professional service fees and implementation services. In addition, from time to time, we enter into agreements with customers to provide access to Travel Network's GDS and, at or near the same time, enter into a separate agreement to provide software solutions through SaaS and hosted delivery. These multiple performance obligation arrangements involve judgments, including estimates of the selling prices of goods and services, attribution of variable consideration, assessments of the likelihood of nonpayment and estimates of total costs and costs to complete a project.\nRevenue recognition from our Airline Solutions business requires significant judgments such as identifying distinct performance obligations including material rights within an agreement, estimating the total contract consideration and allocating amounts to each distinct performance obligation, determining whether variable pricing within a contract meets the allocation objective, and forecasting future volumes. For a small subset of our contracts, we are required to forecast volumes as a result of pricing variability within the contract in order to calculate the rate for revenue recognition. Any changes in these judgments and estimates could have an impact on the revenue recognized in future periods.\nThe professional and implementation services are generally performed in the early stages of the agreements. Access to our GDS is provided over the full term of the contract. Software solutions through SaaS and hosted delivery are often not provided until implementation services are completed. We evaluate revenue recognition for agreements with customers which generally are represented by individual contracts but could include groups of contracts if the contracts are executed at or near the same time. Typically, access to our GDS and our professional service fees are separated from the implementation and software hosting services. We account for separate performance obligations on an individual basis with value assigned to each performance obligation based on our best estimate of relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\"). Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. SSP is assessed annually using a historical analysis of contracts with customers executed in the most recently completed calendar year to determine the range of selling prices applicable to a distinct good or service. In making these judgments, we analyze various factors, including discounting practices, price lists, contract prices, value differentiators, customer segmentation and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers. As our market strategies evolve, we may modify pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to SSP.\nDeferred customer advances and discounts are amortized against revenue in future periods as the related revenue is earned. Our contract assets include revenue recognized for services already transferred to a customer, for which the fulfillment of another contractual performance obligation is required, before we have the unconditional right to bill and collect based on contract terms. Contract assets are reviewed for recoverability on a periodic basis based on a review of impairment indicators. Deferred customer advances and discounts are reviewed for recoverability based on future contracted revenues and estimated direct costs of the contract when a significant event occurs that could impact the recoverability of the assets, such as a significant contract modification or early renewal of contract terms. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not impair any of these assets as a result of the related contracts becoming uncollectable, modified or canceled. See Note 4. Impairment and Related Charges regarding 2017 impairments. Contracts are priced to generate total revenues over the life of the contract that exceed any discounts or advances provided and any upfront costs incurred to implement the customer contract.\nAir Booking Cancellation Reserve\nTransaction revenue for airline travel reservations is recognized by Travel Network at the time of the booking of the reservation, net of estimated future cancellations. Cancellations prior to the day of departure are estimated based on the historical level of cancellation rates, adjusted to take into account any recent factors which could cause a change in those rates. In circumstances where expected cancellation rates or booking behavior changes, our estimates are revised, and in these circumstances, future cancellation rates could vary materially, with a corresponding variation in revenue net of estimated future cancellations. Factors that could have a significant effect on our estimates include global security issues, epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters, general economic conditions, the financial condition of travel suppliers, and travel related accidents.\nBusiness Combinations\nAuthoritative guidance for business combinations requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies, contingent consideration, where applicable, and previously-held investment interests. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to: future expected cash flows, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents; the acquired company's brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nFor a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nDepending on the circumstances, the fair value of contingent consideration is determined based on management's best estimate of fair value given the specific facts and circumstances of the contractual arrangement, considering the likelihood of payment, payment terms and management's best estimates of future performance results on the acquisition date, if applicable.\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance's or contingency's estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill was assigned to each reporting unit based on that reporting unit's percentage of enterprise value as of the date of the acquisition of Sabre Corporation by TPG and Silver Lake plus goodwill associated with acquisitions since that time. We have three reporting units associated with our continuing operations: Travel Network, Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions. Goodwill related to our reporting units totaled $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2019.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when impairment indicators exist. We begin our evaluation with a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value before applying a quantitative assessment. If it is determined through the evaluation of events or circumstances that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we perform a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit. If the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of that reporting unit, the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill is reduced to its fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance, resulting in an impairment charge.\nWe did not record any goodwill impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The determination of fair value requires us to make significant judgments and estimates including cash flow projections and assumptions related to market participants, the principal markets, and the highest and best use of the reporting units. Changes in the assumptions used in our impairment testing may result in future impairment losses which could have a material impact on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each of our three reporting units by more than 10%.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are assigned depreciable lives of two to thirty years, depending on classification, and are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of definite-lived intangible assets used in combination to generate cash flows largely independent of other assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist for definite-lived intangible assets, the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the expected service potential of the assets are compared to the carrying value of the assets. If our projection of undiscounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the intangible assets, no impairment charge is recorded. If our projection of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, the intangible assets are then measured at fair value and an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value of the assets over its fair value. We also evaluate the need for additional impairment disclosures based on our Level 3 inputs. For fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we disclose the valuation processes used by the reporting entity. We did not record material intangible asset impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nThe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing include: (i) the discount rate, (ii) the expected long-term growth rate and (iii) annual cash flow projections. See Note 10. Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements.\nCapitalized Implementation Costs\nCapitalized implementation costs represents upfront costs to implement new customer contracts under our SaaS and hosted revenue model. Capitalized implementation costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contract term, ranging from three to ten years, as they are recoverable through deferred or future revenues associated with the relevant contract. These assets are reviewed for recoverability on a periodic basis or when an event occurs that could impact the recoverability of the assets, such as a significant contract modification or early renewal of contract terms. Recoverability is measured based on the future estimated revenue and direct costs of the contract compared to the capitalized implementation costs. We record an impairment charge for the portion of the asset considered unrecoverable in the period identified, while considering the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts and judgments made in estimating revenue and direct costs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $2 million in impairments associated with unrecoverable amounts in capitalized implementation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $4 million in impairments associated with unrecoverable amounts in capitalized implementation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, given the substantial amount of uncertainty of reaching an agreement regarding the implementation of services pursuant to the contract with a customer in our Airline Solutions business, we assessed recoverability of all balances with the customer which resulted in an impairment charge totaling $81 million, which included related capitalized implementation costs. See Note 4. Impairment and Related Charges, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCapitalized Software Developed for Internal Use\nWe capitalize certain costs related to our infrastructure, software applications and reservation systems under authoritative guidance on software developed for internal use during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary and post project development activities are expensed as incurred. When determining whether applicable costs qualify for capitalization, we use judgment in distinguishing between the preliminary project and application development stages of the project and in determining whether these costs result in additional functionality for existing internal use software. In 2019, our development teams substantially completed the transition to utilizing the agile development methodology, which is characterized by a more dynamic development process with iterative activities that involve planning, design, coding and testing. This methodology requires additional review of the stages to ensure the applicable criteria are met for capitalization and may be less likely to meet the criteria for capitalization. As we expected, this transition towards implementing this methodology reduced our capitalization of certain costs with a corresponding increase in our product and technology operating expenses. Costs that cannot be separated\nbetween maintenance of, and relatively minor upgrades and enhancements to, internal use software are also expensed as incurred.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we capitalized $89 million, $252 million, and $251 million, respectively, related to software developed for internal use.\nIncome and Non-Income Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review deferred tax assets by jurisdiction to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized. In performing this review, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. A change in these assumptions could cause an increase or decrease to the valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in the effective tax rate, which could materially impact our results of operations. At year end, we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances.\nWe believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we established and maintain a valuation allowance on the non-U.S. deferred tax assets of our lastminute.com and other non-US subsidiaries of $33 million and $55 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Also it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain U.S. state deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we established and maintain a valuation allowance on these U.S. state deferred tax assets of $5 million and $4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We reassess these assumptions regularly, which could cause an increase or decrease to the valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in the effective tax rate, and could materially impact our results of operations.\nWe operate in numerous countries where our income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities. Because we operate globally, the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change, and the amounts at issue can be substantial. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a liability, including interest and penalty, of $81 million and $93 million, respectively, for unrecognized tax benefits, of which $63 million and $74 million, respectively, would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the provision for income taxes from continuing operations.\nLoss Contingencies\nWhile certain legal proceedings and related indemnification obligations and certain tax matters to which we are a party specify the amounts claimed, these claims may not represent reasonably possible losses. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation and tax claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted, nor can the amount of possible loss or range of loss, if any, be reasonably estimated, except in circumstances where an aggregate litigation accrual has been recorded for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter.

Because we operate globally, the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change, and the amounts at issue can be substantial. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a liability, including interest and penalty, of $81 million and $93 million, respectively, for unrecognized tax benefits, of which $63 million and $74 million, respectively, would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the provision for income taxes from continuing operations.\nIn April 2019, a customer of Travel Network and Airline Solutions, Jet Airways suspended flight operations and is now in insolvency proceedings. Our revenue was negatively impacted in 2019 which will continue in 2020.\nAs a result of the enactment of the TCJA, we recorded a one-time transition tax on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We do not consider these undistributed earnings to be indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2019, with certain limited exceptions. We consider the undistributed capital investments in our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2019, and have not provided deferred taxes on any outside basis differences. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries are available to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.\nContinued focus by travel suppliers on cost cutting and exerting influence over distribution\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when impairment indicators exist. We begin our evaluation with a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value before applying a quantitative assessment. If it is determined through the evaluation of events or circumstances that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we perform a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit. If the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of that reporting unit, the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill is reduced to its fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance, resulting in an impairment charge.\nLoss Contingencies\nThere are structural differences between the geographies in which we operate. Due to our geographic concentration, our results of operations are particularly sensitive to factors affecting North America. For example, booking fees per transaction in North America have traditionally been lower than those in Europe. By growing internationally with our TMCs and OTAs customers and expanding the travel content available on our GDS to target regional traveler preferences, we anticipate that we will grow share in North America, Europe and Latin America. We invest for sustainable share growth, and in certain parts of Asia-Pacific and Latin America, our share may be impacted by travel agency deals we have declined to pursue due to credit risk and unfavorable economics.

In September 2013, Sabre GLBL entered into an agreement to amend the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to add a new class of term loans in the amount of $350 million (the 2013 Incremental Term Loan Facility\u201d).\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,974,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,866,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,598,484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue </td> <td>3,035,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,791,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,513,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>576,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>513,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>510,075 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment and related charges </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,112 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>363,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>562,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>493,440 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>(156,391) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(157,017) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(153,925) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(633) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,012) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Joint venture equity income </td> <td>2,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,580 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net </td> <td>(9,432) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,509) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,530 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income taxes </td> <td>199,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>398,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>377,613 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td>35,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128,037 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>164,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>340,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>249,576 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 23, 2017, Sabre GLBL entered into a Fourth Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, Term Loan A Refinancing Amendment to the Credit Agreement, and Second Revolving Facility Refinancing Amendment to the Credit Agreement to refinance and modify the terms of the 2017 Term Loan B, the 2016 Term Loan A, and the 2016 Revolver, resulting in a reduction of the applicable margins for each of these instruments and approximately a one-year extension of the maturity of the 2016 Term Loan A and 2016 Revolver (the 2017 Refinancing\u201d). We incurred no additional indebtedness as a result of the 2017 Refinancing. The 2017 Refinancing included a $400 million revolving credit facility (\"Revolver\") that replaced the 2016 Revolver, as well as the application of the proceeds of the approximately $1,891 million incremental Term Loan B facility ( Term Loan B\u201d) and $570 million Term Loan A facility ( Term Loan A\u201d) to replace the 2017 Term Loan B and the 2016 Term Loan A. The maturity of the Revolver and the Term Loan A was extended from July 18, 2021 to July 1, 2022. The applicable margins for the Term Loan B were reduced to 2.25% per annum for Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.25% per annum for base rate loans. The applicable margins for the Term Loan A and the Revolver were reduced to (i) between 2.50% and 1.75% per annum for Eurocurrency rate loans and (ii) between 1.50% and 0.75% per annum for base rate loans, in each case with the applicable margin for any quarter reduced by 25 basis points (up to 75 basis points total) if the Senior Secured First-Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) is less than 3.75 to 1.0, 3.00 to 1.0, or 2.25 to 1.0, respectively. The Eurocurrency rate is based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. If a published U.S. dollar LIBOR rate is unavailable, the interest rates on our debt indexed to LIBOR will be determined using various alternative methods set forth in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, any of which could result in interest obligations that are more than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on this debt if U.S. dollar LIBOR were available in its current form. See Risk Factors-We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations.\u201d We anticipate amending our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement prior to the phaseout of LIBOR to provide for a Eurocurrency rate alternative to LIBOR.\n\u2022receipt of net proceeds totaling $2 million from the settlement of employee stock-option awards, including a payment of $10 million in income tax withholdings associated with the settlement of employee restricted-stock awards.\n(3)Represents minimum amounts due to DXC under the terms of an outsourcing agreement through which DXC manages a significant portion of our information technology systems. Also reflects minimum amounts due under an information technology agreement entered into during the first quarter of 2020. Actual payments may vary significantly from the minimum amounts presented.\nIncome and Non-Income Taxes\nDirect Billable Bookings\u201d and Passengers Boarded\u201d are the primary metrics utilized by Travel Network and Airline Solutions, respectively, to measure operating performance. Travel Network generates fees for each Direct Billable Booking which include bookings made through our GDS (e.g., Air, and Lodging, Ground and Sea (\"LGS\")) and through our joint venture partners in cases where we are paid directly by the travel supplier. Passengers Boarded ( PBs\u201d) is the primary metric used by Airline Solutions to recognize SaaS and hosted revenue from recurring usage-based fees. The primary metric utilized by Hospitality Solutions is booking transactions processed through the SynXis Central Reservations System. These key metrics allow management to analyze customer volume over time for each of our three business segments to monitor industry trends and analyze performance. We believe that these key metrics are useful for investors and other third parties as indicators of our financial performance and industry trends. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our transaction counts for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges associated with their measurement. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of these metrics, and these estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology.\nWe believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we established and maintain a valuation allowance on the non-U.S. deferred tax assets of our lastminute.com and other non-US subsidiaries of $33 million and $55 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Also it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain U.S. state deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we established and maintain a valuation allowance on these U.S. state deferred tax assets of $5 million and $4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We reassess these assumptions regularly, which could cause an increase or decrease to the valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in the effective tax rate, and could materially impact our results of operations.\nWe had no balance outstanding under the Revolver as of December 31, 2019 and as of December 31, 2018. We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $12 million and $15 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which reduced our overall credit capacity under the Revolver.\n2016. See Risk Factors-Our travel supplier customers may experience financial instability or consolidation, pursue cost reductions, change their distribution model or undergo other changes.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2018 we have utilized substantially all of our U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and a portion of our available U.S. federal tax credits. As a result, we expect an increase in the amount of our cash taxes in future years, beginning in 2020.\nGoodwill was assigned to each reporting unit based on that reporting unit's percentage of enterprise value as of the date of the acquisition of Sabre Corporation by TPG and Silver Lake plus goodwill associated with acquisitions since that time. We have three reporting units associated with our continuing operations: Travel Network, Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions. Goodwill related to our reporting units totaled $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2019.\nTerm Facility Amendment\n\u2022a $5 million increase in Reservation revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily driven by the acquisition of Radixx and organic growth in our existing customer base. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the volume of Passengers Boarded, which declined 2% to 741 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by the demigration of the Transitioned Customers as well as the impact of Jet Airways' insolvency and the impact of the 737 Max incident on a particular customer.\nShare Repurchase Program\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, to our consolidated financial statements for more information on impacts of ASC 606 to our various streams of revenue recognition.\nbetween maintenance of, and relatively minor upgrades and enhancements to, internal use software are also expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nIn February 2017, our Board approved a $500 million multi-year Share Repurchase Program. Repurchases under the program may take place in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Approximately $287 million remains authorized for repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 3,673,768 shares totaling $78 million pursuant to this Share Repurchase Program. There were no shares repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFor a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 17.7% and 14.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to the impact of 2018 adjustments related to the enactment of the TCJA for deferred taxes and foreign tax effects of $27 million and, in 2019, an unfavorable impact of our geographic mix of taxable income, partially offset by an increase in net favorable U.S. tax permanent differences and certain tax credits and incentives.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are: (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) cash and cash equivalents and (iii) borrowings under our $400 million Revolver (see -Senior Secured Credit Facilities \u201d). Borrowing availability under our Revolver is reduced by our outstanding letters of credit and restricted cash collateral. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our cash and cash equivalents, Revolver and outstanding letters of credit were as follows (in thousands):\nWe consider cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash. Securities with contractual maturities of three months or less, when purchased, are considered cash equivalents. We record changes in a book overdraft position, in which our bank account is not overdrawn but recently issued and outstanding checks result in a negative general ledger balance, as cash flows from financing activities. We invest in a money market fund which is classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows. We held no short-term investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following is a discussion of trends that we believe are the most significant opportunities and challenges currently impacting our business and industry. The discussion also includes management's assessment of the effects these trends have had and are expected to have on our results of continuing operations. This information is not an exhaustive list of all of the factors that could affect our results and should be read in conjunction with the factors referred to in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncreasing travel agency incentive consideration\n\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $725 million and consisted of net income from continuing operations of $341 million, adjustments for non-cash and other items of $607 million and a decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $223 million. The adjustments for non-cash and other items consist primarily of $413 million of depreciation and amortization, $78 million in amortization of upfront incentive consideration, $57 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $43 million of deferred income taxes. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $223 million was primarily the result of $89 million used for upfront incentive consideration, a $75 million increase in accounts receivable, $39 million used for capitalized implementation costs, a $30 million increase in other assets, a $27 million decrease in accounts payable, and a $15 million decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits. These decreases were partially offset by the receipt of $29 million from an insurance settlement, an increase of $8 million in deferred revenues, and a decrease of $14 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nKey Metrics\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, share repurchases, and dividends will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. See Risk Factors-We may require more cash than we generate in our operating activities, and additional funding on reasonable terms or at all may not be available.\u201d\nWe are also required to pay down the term loans by an amount equal to 50% of annual excess cash flow, as defined in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. This percentage requirement may decrease or be eliminated if certain leverage ratios are achieved. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2018, we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment in 2019, and no excess cash flow payment was required in 2020 with respect to our results for the year ended December 31, 2019. We are further required to pay down the term loan with proceeds from certain asset sales or borrowings as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nFurthermore, on an ongoing basis, we will evaluate and consider strategic acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, repurchasing shares of our common stock (including pursuant to our multi-year $500 million share repurchase program (the \"Share Repurchase Program\")) or our outstanding debt obligations in open market or in privately negotiated transactions, as well as other transactions we believe may create stockholder value or enhance financial performance. These transactions may require cash expenditures or generate proceeds and, to the extent they require cash expenditures, may be funded through a combination of cash on hand, debt or equity offerings, or utilization of our Revolver.\nHistorically, large travel suppliers built custom in-house software and applications for their business process needs. In response to a desire for more flexible systems given increasingly complex and constantly changing technological requirements, reduced IT budgets and increased focus on cost efficiency, many travel suppliers turned to third party solutions providers for many of their key technologies and began to license software from software providers. We believe that significant revenue opportunity remains in this outsourcing trend, as legacy in-house systems continue to migrate and upgrade to third party systems. The shift from a model with initial license fees to one with recurring monthly fees associated with our SaaS and hosted solutions, has resulted in an ongoing revenue stream based on the number of passengers boarded. However, under the SaaS and hosted solutions revenue model, revenue recognition may be delayed due to longer implementation schedules for larger suppliers. The SaaS and hosted models' centralized deployment also allows us to save time and money by reducing maintenance and implementation tasks and lowering operating costs.\nOverview\nOn March 2, 2018, Sabre GLBL entered into a Fifth Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to refinance and modify the terms of the Term Loan B as discussed above. See \"-Recent Events Impacting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" above.\nCash Flows\nGrowing demand for continued technology improvements in the fragmented hotel market\n\u2022annual payment on the TRA liability for $101 million, excluding interest;\nThis consideration grew in the double digits on a per booking basis in 2017 and 2018 due to higher incentives in certain geographical markets and from new customer conversions and reverted to single-digit growth in 2019. We expect continued single-digit growth in the near term due to our focus on managing incentive consideration. Although incentive rate increases may continue to impact margins, we expect these increases to be more than offset by growth in Travel Network revenue. This expectation is based in part on our continuing to offer value added services and content to travel buyers, such as the Sabre Red Workspace, a SaaS product that provides a simplified interface and enhanced travel agency workflow and productivity tools.\nWe did not record any goodwill impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The determination of fair value requires us to make significant judgments and estimates including cash flow projections and assumptions related to market participants, the principal markets, and the highest and best use of the reporting units. Changes in the assumptions used in our impairment testing may result in future impairment losses which could have a material impact on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each of our three reporting units by more than 10%.\nAir Booking Cancellation Reserve\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a comparison of our Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and our Cash Flow discussion for the year ended December 31, 2017, see \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC on February 15, 2019.\nRecent Developments Affecting our Results of Operations\nCash flows used in discontinued operating activities were $2 million, $2 million, and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cash flows used by discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, primarily resulted from expenses associated with legal contingencies related to hotel occupancy taxes.\n(8)Excludes pension obligations, see Note 15. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans, to our consolidated financial statements.\nOn March 2, 2018, Sabre GLBL entered into a Fifth Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to refinance and modify the terms of the Term Loan B, resulting in a reduction of the applicable margins for the Term Loan B to 2.00% per annum for Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.00% per annum for base rate loans. We incurred no additional indebtedness as a result of this transaction and incurred $2 million in financing fees recorded within Other, net and a $1 million loss extinguishment of debt in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCost of revenue\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe believe that cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand and our Revolver provide adequate liquidity for our operational and capital expenditures and other obligations over the next twelve months, as well as funding our acquisition of Farelogix. We are reviewing opportunities to refinance Term Loan A, Term Loan B, and our Revolver, depending on market conditions. This refinancing may include a debt issuance, a reallocation between Term Loan A and Term Loan B and an extension of the maturity date of Term Loan A and our revolver. We may supplement our current liquidity through debt or equity offerings to support future strategic investments, or to pay down debt including debt offerings to pay down a portion of our outstanding debt. We funded TRA payments of $72 million, $74 million, and $60 million, including interest, due in January 2020, January 2019 and January 2018, respectively, with cash on hand.\nRevenues\nDepreciation and amortization-Depreciation and amortization decreased $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to customer implementations that became fully amortized during the year, partially offset by additional depreciation related to the completion of software developed for internal use.\nThe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing include: (i) the discount rate, (ii) the expected long-term growth rate and (iii) annual cash flow projections. See Note 10. Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements.\nTravel Network-Cost of revenue increased $158 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, partially as a result of a $71 million increase in incentive consideration primarily due to volume growth in North America bookings as well as rate increases across all regions. The increase is also driven by a $69 million increase in labor costs and a $19 million increase in technology expenditures, both driven by the execution of our technology strategy, including cloud migration, mainframe offload and utilization of agile development methods, which increases the expensed portion of our total technology spend.\nOn October 15, 2019, we acquired Radixx, a leading airline retailing software provider for $110 million, utilizing cash on hand. Radixx is being integrated and is managed as a part of our Airline Solutions segment.\nOur accounting policies that include significant estimates and assumptions include: (i) estimation for revenue recognition and multiple performance obligation arrangements, (ii) determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, (iii) the evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and goodwill, (iv) assumptions utilized to test recoverability of capitalized implementation costs, (v) judgments in capitalization of software developed for internal use, and (vi) the evaluation of uncertainties surrounding the calculation of our tax assets and liabilities. We regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate\u201d if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation and if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur and could have a material effect on the presentation of financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies, contingent consideration, where applicable, and previously-held investment interests. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nTravel Network primarily generates revenues from Direct Billable Bookings processed on our GDS as well as the sale of aggregated bookings data to carriers. Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions primarily generate revenue through upfront solution fees and recurring usage-based fees for the use of our software solutions hosted on secure platforms or deployed through our SaaS and through other professional service fees including Digital Experience (\"DX\"). Certain professional service fees are discrete sales opportunities that may have a high degree of variability from period to period, and we cannot guarantee that we will have such fees in the future consistent with prior periods. Airline Solutions also generates revenue through software licensing and maintenance fees. Recognition of license fees upon delivery has previously resulted and will continue to result in periodic fluctuations in revenue recognized.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that sell our services to new customers and administratively support the business, information technology and communication costs, professional service fees, certain settlement charges or reimbursements, costs to defend legal disputes, bad debt expense, depreciation and amortization and other overhead costs.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated through transaction based fees that we charge to our customers. For Travel Network, this fee is in the form of a transaction fee for bookings on our GDS; for Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions, this fee is a recurring usage-based fee for the use of our SaaS and hosted systems, as well as upfront fees and professional service fees. Items that are not allocated to our business segments are identified as corporate and primarily include stock-based compensation expense, litigation costs, corporate headcount-related costs and other items that are not identifiable with either one of our segments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded final adjustments to our provisional amounts recognized related to the TCJA, resulting in a decrease in our provision for income taxes from continuing operations of $27 million for deferred tax assets and foreign tax effects (see Note 7. Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements).\nDividends\nContractual Obligations\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates, and our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary under different assumptions and conditions. In addition, our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard.\nAuthoritative guidance for business combinations requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\n(7)We made payments, including interest, of $72 million in January 2020. See Note 7. Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources-Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d\nTravel agency incentive consideration is a large portion of Travel Network expenses. The vast majority of incentive consideration is tied to absolute booking volumes based on transactions such as flight segments booked. Incentive consideration, which often increases once a certain volume or percentage of bookings is met, is provided in two ways, according to the terms of the agreement: (i) on a periodic basis over the term of the contract and (ii) in some instances, up front at the inception or modification of contracts, which is capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the contract.\nWhile certain legal proceedings and related indemnification obligations and certain tax matters to which we are a party specify the amounts claimed, these claims may not represent reasonably possible losses. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation and tax claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted, nor can the amount of possible loss or range of loss, if any, be reasonably estimated, except in circumstances where an aggregate litigation accrual has been recorded for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new information or developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations.\n\nDepreciation and amortization included in cost of revenue is associated with property and equipment, amortization of capitalized implementation costs which relates to Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions, intangible assets for technology purchased through acquisitions or established with our take private transaction in 2007, and software developed for internal use that supports our revenue, businesses and systems. Cost of revenue also includes amortization of upfront incentive consideration representing upfront payments or other consideration provided to travel agencies for reservations made on our GDS which are capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the contract.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\n________________________________________________________________________________________\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\n\u2022payment of $154 million in dividends on our common stock;\nOn February 22, 2017, Sabre GLBL entered into a Third Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2017 Term Facility Amendment\u201d). The new agreement replaced the 2013 Term Loan B, 2013 Term Loan C, and 2013 Incremental Term Loan Facility with a single class of term loan (the \"2017 Term Loan B\") with an aggregate principal amount of $1,900 million maturing on February 22, 2024. The proceeds of $1,898 million, net of $2 million discount on the 2017 Term Loan B, were used to pay off approximately $1,761 million of all existing classes of outstanding term loans (other than the 2016 Term Loan A), pay related accrued interest and pay $12 million in associated financing fees, which were recorded as debt modification costs in Other, net in the consolidated statement of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The remaining proceeds of the 2017 Term Loan B were used to pay off approximately $80 million of Sabre's outstanding mortgage on its corporate headquarters on March 31, 2017 and for other general corporate purposes. Unamortized debt issuance costs and discount related to existing classes of outstanding term loans prior to the 2017 Term\nImmediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering, we entered into the TRA that provides the stockholders and equity award holders that were our stockholders and equity award holders, respectively, immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering (collectively, the \"Pre-IPO Existing Stockholders\") the right to receive future payments from us equal to 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal income tax that we and our subsidiaries realize as a result of the utilization of certain tax assets attributable to periods prior to our initial public offerings, including NOLs, capital losses and the ability to realize tax amortization of certain intangible assets (collectively, the \"Pre-IPO Tax Assets\"). In connection with the TRA, we made payments, including interest, of $72 million in January 2020, $30 million in April 2019, and $74 million, $60 million and $101 million in January 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In December 2019, we exercised our right under the terms of the TRA to accelerate our remaining payments under the TRA and make an early termination payment of $1 million, to the Pre-IPO Existing Shareholders, which was included in the January 2020 payment of $72 million described above. As a result, no future payments are required to be made to the Pre-IPO Existing Stockholders under the TRA.\nTravel Network-Revenue increased $76 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in transaction-based revenue of $75 million to $2,709 million. The increase in revenue primarily resulted from a 1% increase in Direct Billable Bookings to 566 million and growth in the average booking fee rate during the year ended December 31, 2019 due to a discrete shift in the distribution pricing structure for specific European carriers and favorable mix primarily resulting from growth in hotel bookings which have a higher rate.\nOperating Activities\nThe professional and implementation services are generally performed in the early stages of the agreements. Access to our GDS is provided over the full term of the contract. Software solutions through SaaS and hosted delivery are often not provided until implementation services are completed. We evaluate revenue recognition for agreements with customers which generally are represented by individual contracts but could include groups of contracts if the contracts are executed at or near the same time. Typically, access to our GDS and our professional service fees are separated from the implementation and software hosting services. We account for separate performance obligations on an individual basis with value assigned to each performance obligation based on our best estimate of relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\"). Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. SSP is assessed annually using a historical analysis of contracts with customers executed in the most recently completed calendar year to determine the range of selling prices applicable to a distinct good or service. In making these judgments, we analyze various factors, including discounting practices, price lists, contract prices, value differentiators, customer segmentation and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers. As our market strategies evolve, we may modify pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to SSP.\n\nImpact of customer consolidation in Hospitality Solutions\nIntersegment Transactions\nDepending on the circumstances, the fair value of contingent consideration is determined based on management's best estimate of fair value given the specific facts and circumstances of the contractual arrangement, considering the likelihood of payment, payment terms and management's best estimates of future performance results on the acquisition date, if applicable.\nWe have included below a discussion of the accounting policies involving material estimates and assumptions that we believe are most critical to the preparation of our financial statements, how we apply such policies and how results differing from our estimates and assumptions would affect the amounts presented in our financial statements. We have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these accounting policies with our Audit Committee. Although we believe these policies to be the most critical, other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements and certain of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions. For further information about our significant accounting policies, see Note 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements.\nCapitalized implementation costs represents upfront costs to implement new customer contracts under our SaaS and hosted revenue model. Capitalized implementation costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contract term, ranging from three to ten years, as they are recoverable through deferred or future revenues associated with the relevant contract. These assets are reviewed for recoverability on a periodic basis or when an event occurs that could impact the recoverability of the assets, such as a significant contract modification or early renewal of contract terms. Recoverability is measured based on the future estimated revenue and direct costs of the contract compared to the capitalized implementation costs. We record an impairment charge for the portion of the asset considered unrecoverable in the period identified, while considering the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts and judgments made in estimating revenue and direct costs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $2 million in impairments associated with unrecoverable amounts in capitalized implementation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $4 million in impairments associated with unrecoverable amounts in capitalized implementation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, given the substantial amount of uncertainty of reaching an agreement regarding the implementation of services pursuant to the contract with a customer in our Airline Solutions business, we assessed recoverability of all balances with the customer which resulted in an impairment charge totaling $81 million, which included related capitalized implementation costs. See Note 4. Impairment and Related Charges, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDeferred customer advances and discounts are amortized against revenue in future periods as the related revenue is earned. Our contract assets include revenue recognized for services already transferred to a customer, for which the fulfillment of another contractual performance obligation is required, before we have the unconditional right to bill and collect based on contract terms. Contract assets are reviewed for recoverability on a periodic basis based on a review of impairment indicators. Deferred customer advances and discounts are reviewed for recoverability based on future contracted revenues and estimated direct costs of the contract when a significant event occurs that could impact the recoverability of the assets, such as a significant contract modification or early renewal of contract terms. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not impair any of these assets as a result of the related contracts becoming uncollectable, modified or canceled. See Note 4. Impairment and Related Charges regarding 2017 impairments. Contracts are priced to generate total revenues over the life of the contract that exceed any discounts or advances provided and any upfront costs incurred to implement the customer contract.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance's or contingency's estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur agreements with customers of our Airline Solutions business may have multiple performance obligations which generally include software solutions through SaaS and hosted delivery, professional service fees and implementation services. In addition, from time to time, we enter into agreements with customers to provide access to Travel Network's GDS and, at or near the same time, enter into a separate agreement to provide software solutions through SaaS and hosted delivery. These multiple performance obligation arrangements involve judgments, including estimates of the selling prices of goods and services, attribution of variable consideration, assessments of the likelihood of nonpayment and estimates of total costs and costs to complete a project.\n_______________________\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are assigned depreciable lives of two to thirty years, depending on classification, and are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of definite-lived intangible assets used in combination to generate cash flows largely independent of other assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist for definite-lived intangible assets, the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the expected service potential of the assets are compared to the carrying value of the assets. If our projection of undiscounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the intangible assets, no impairment charge is recorded. If our projection of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, the intangible assets are then measured at fair value and an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value of the assets over its fair value. We also evaluate the need for additional impairment disclosures based on our Level 3 inputs. For fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we disclose the valuation processes used by the reporting entity. We did not record material intangible asset impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n(6)Unrecognized tax benefits include associated interest and penalties. The timing of related cash payments for substantially all of these liabilities is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control.\nAirline Solutions-Cost of revenue increased $46 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily a result of a $62 million increase in labor costs and a $7 million increase in technology expenditures, both driven by the execution of our technology strategy, including cloud migration, mainframe offload and utilization of agile development methods, which increases the expensed portion of our total technology spend. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in non-development labor costs and benefits-related costs of $23 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations were as follows (in thousands):\nFactors Affecting our Results\nIn addition, future revenues may be negatively impacted by, among other things, reduced sales of our software solutions and lower growth in Passengers Boarded due to delayed or uncertain implementations and insolvencies of airline carriers, such as Alitalia Compagnia Aerea Italiana S.p.A. operating as Alitalia ( Alitalia\u201d), that implemented our services in the fourth quarter of\nShift to SaaS and hosted solutions by airlines and hotels to manage their daily operations\nThe differences between our effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily resulted from our geographic mix of taxable income in various tax jurisdictions, tax permanent differences and tax credits.\nIn July 2016, Sabre GLBL entered into a series of amendments (the Credit Agreement Amendments\u201d) to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to provide for an incremental term loan under a new class with an aggregate principal amount of $600 million (the 2016 Term Loan A\u201d) and to replace the 2013 Revolver with a new revolving credit facility totaling $400 million (the 2016 Revolver\u201d). The proceeds of $597 million, net of $3 million discount, from the 2016 Term Loan A were used to repay $350 million of outstanding principal on our 2013 Term Loan B and 2013 Incremental Term Loan Facility, on a pro rata basis, repay the $120 million then-outstanding balance on the 2016 Revolver, and pay $11 million in associated financing fees. We recognized a $4 million loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with these transactions during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nUnder the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the loan parties are subject to certain customary non-financial covenants, including certain restrictions on incurring certain types of indebtedness, creation of liens on certain assets, making of certain investments, and payment of dividends, as well as a maximum leverage ratio. Pursuant to Credit Agreement Amendments, effective July 18, 2016, the maximum leverage ratio has been adjusted to be based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) and we are required, at all times (no longer solely when a threshold amount of revolving loans or letters of credit were outstanding), to maintain a Total Net Leverage Ratio of less than 4.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2019 we are in compliance with all covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nTravel suppliers continue to look for ways to decrease their costs and to increase their control over distribution. Airline consolidations, pricing pressure during contract renegotiations and the use of direct distribution may continue to subject our business to challenges. The shift from indirect distribution channels, such as our GDS, to direct distribution channels, may result from increased content availability on supplier operated websites or from increased participation of meta search engines, such as Kayak and Google, which direct consumers to supplier operated websites. This trend may adversely affect our Travel Network contract renegotiations with suppliers that use alternative distribution channels. For example, airlines may withhold part of their content for distribution exclusively through their own direct distribution channels or offer more attractive terms for content available through those direct channels. This occurred in 2018 when certain European carriers began to withhold part of their content from our GDS to make use of alternative distribution channels, which may adversely affect our future revenue growth. However, in North America, which is our largest region, the rate at which bookings have shifted from indirect to direct distribution channels has been relatively consistent for a number of reasons, including the increased participation of LCC/hybrids in direct channels. Over the last several years, notable carriers that previously only distributed directly, including JetBlue, Norwegian and Interjet, have adopted our GDS. Other carriers such as EVA Airways, and Virgin Australia have further increased their participation in a GDS. Conversely, Air India, Ltd. fully migrated from our GDS during 2019.\nWe announced on November 14, 2018 that we have entered into an agreement to purchase Farelogix, a travel industry innovator in the airline information technology and distribution landscape for $360 million, which will be funded at closing by cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolver. On August 20, 2019, the DOJ filed a complaint seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the acquisition. The trial concluded on February 6, 2020 and the trial court has not yet issued its decision. In addition, the CMA has referred its review of the acquisition for a Phase 2 investigation and has published its provisional findings of competition concerns. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. There can be no assurance that the acquisition will occur on these terms or at all. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant fees associated with this acquisition, including for the items discussed above, which are included in general and administrative expense.\n\nUpon completion of our technology transformation in 2024, we expect to benefit from lower cloud infrastructure costs and higher margins. We believe that continued investment in our technology will help to provide us the necessary framework and infrastructure for a secure and stable architecture for our customers, grow our addressable market, provide new revenue opportunities, reduce costs and will help to improve sales of our software solutions. However, there are various risks associated with our technology transformation efforts, including not achieving the amount of anticipated cost savings, not completing the steps during their current projected time frame, or changing the approach leading to, among other things, additional changes in our mix of technology spend between operating expense and capitalization.\n(1) Direct Billable Bookings\u201d is the primary metric utilized by Travel Network to measure operating performance and includes bookings made through our GDS and through our joint venture partners in cases where we are paid directly by the travel supplier.\nTravel buyers can shift their bookings to or from our Travel Network business\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the comprehensive update to revenue recognition guidance for Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\"), which replaced the previous standard (\"ASC 605\"), using the modified retrospective approach. Under the updated standard, revenue is recognized when a company transfers the promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods and services. See Note 2.\n(4)Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of December 31, 2019. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.\n\u2022repurchase of 3,673,768 shares of our common stock outstanding totaling $78 million; and\nRevenue recognition from our Airline Solutions business requires significant judgments such as identifying distinct performance obligations including material rights within an agreement, estimating the total contract consideration and allocating amounts to each distinct performance obligation, determining whether variable pricing within a contract meets the allocation objective, and forecasting future volumes. For a small subset of our contracts, we are required to forecast volumes as a result of pricing variability within the contract in order to calculate the rate for revenue recognition. Any changes in these judgments and estimates could have an impact on the revenue recognized in future periods.\nWe expect to further enable our technology transformation with incremental investments of approximately $150 million in 2020 and continued investment over the next few years which will have a material impact on our financial results. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our re-platforming efforts to open source and cloud-based solutions, as previously disclosed, with the goal of modernizing our architecture, driving efficiency in development and ongoing technology costs, further enhancing the stability and security of our network, and complying with data privacy regulations, and in next-generation retailing capabilities, including NDC and personalized offers, LCC, and full-service hotel PMS offerings. In 2020, we expect total capital expenditures to range from $80 million to $120 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we capitalized $89 million, $252 million, and $251 million, respectively, related to software developed for internal use.\nCost of revenue incurred by Travel Network, Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions consists of expenses related to technology operations including hosting, third-party software and expensed research and development labor costs, other salaries and benefits, and allocated overhead such as facilities and other support costs. Cost of revenue for Travel Network also includes incentive consideration expense representing payments or other consideration to travel agencies for reservations made on our GDS which accrue on a monthly basis.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review deferred tax assets by jurisdiction to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized. In performing this review, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. A change in these assumptions could cause an increase or decrease to the valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in the effective tax rate, which could materially impact our results of operations. At year end, we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances.\nCorporate cost of revenue includes expenses associated with our technology organization such as corporate systems and risk and security. Corporate cost of revenue also includes certain expenses such as stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, legal reserves and other items not identifiable with one of our segments.\nTechnology Expenditures\nIn April 2019, a customer of Travel Network and Airline Solutions, Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (\"Jet Airways\"), suspended flight operations and is now in insolvency proceedings. Our revenue was negatively impacted in 2019, and this negative impact will continue in 2020. This insolvency, coupled with the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and channel shift related to certain European carriers, has negatively impacted our revenue growth and contributed to reduced growth rates in the GDS industry. We expect this trend to persist into 2020. In addition, our revenue was negatively impacted in 2019 from the effects of the 737 MAX incident on one particular carrier, and we expect this negative impact will continue in 2020. Finally, for Airline Solutions, Pakistan International Airlines Corporation, Bangkok Airways Public Company Limited, and Philippine Airlines, Inc. (the \"Transitioned Customers\"), previously made decisions in 2018 to transition from our services, which will dilute our growth rates on a year-over-year basis. Pakistan International Airlines, Philippine Airlines, and Bangkok Airways Public Company Limited transitioned in September 2018, March 2019, and August 2019, respectively.\nLiquidity Outlook\nThese trends have impacted the revenue of Travel Network, which recognizes revenue for airline ticket sales based on transaction volumes. Simultaneously, this focus on cost cutting and direct distribution has also presented opportunities for Airline Solutions. Many airlines have turned to outside providers for key systems, process and industry expertise and other products that assist in their cost cutting initiatives in order to focus on their primary revenue generating activities.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $581 million and consisted of net income from continuing operations of $164 million, adjustments for non-cash and other items of $568 million and a decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $151 million. The adjustments for non-cash and other items consist primarily of $415 million of depreciation and amortization, $83 million in amortization of upfront incentive consideration, $67 million of stock-based compensation expense, $23 million of deferred income taxes, and $21 million allowance for doubtful accounts. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $151 million was primarily the result of $71 million used for upfront incentive consideration, $34 million increase in accounts receivable, $29 million used for capitalized implementation costs, $27 million decrease in accounts payable, $17 million decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits, and a $12 million decrease in deferred revenues. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease of $39 million in other assets and a decrease of $1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nAmortization of upfront incentive consideration-Amortization of upfront incentive consideration increased $5 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in upfront consideration provided to travel agencies.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $63 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in our legal costs associated with the potential acquisition of Farelogix of $41 million, an increase in labor costs of $24 million, an increase in technology costs of $14 million related to strategic investments in cybersecurity and corporate systems, an increase in bad debt expense of $13 million, and an increase in other antitrust litigation expenses of $3 million. The increase was partially offset by the reversal of our previously accrued loss related to the US Airways legal matter for $32 million. See Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nSecondary Public Offerings\nCapitalized Implementation Costs\nWe connect people and places with technology that reimagines the business of travel. We operate through three business segments: (i) Travel Network, our global business-to-business travel marketplace for travel suppliers and travel buyers, (ii) Airline Solutions, a broad portfolio of software technology products and solutions primarily for airlines, and (iii) Hospitality Solutions, an extensive suite of leading software solutions for hoteliers. Collectively, these offerings enable travel suppliers to better serve their customers across the entire travel lifecycle, from route planning to post-trip business intelligence and analytics.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for each of the periods presented (in thousands):\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\u2022payment of $154 million in dividends on our common stock;\nFacility Amendment of $9 million and $3 million, respectively, will continue to be amortized over the remaining term of the 2017 Term Loan B along with the Term Loan B discount of $2 million. See Note 9. Derivatives, to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the discontinuation of hedge accounting related to our existing interest rate swaps as a result of the 2017 Term Facility Amendment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock totaling $154 million and expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends thereafter. Our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.14 per share of our common stock, which will be paid on March 30, 2020 to stockholders of record as of March 20, 2020. We funded the 2019 dividends, and intend to fund any future dividends, from cash generated from our operations. Future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and the amount of cash dividends per share will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions, number of shares of common stock outstanding and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant. The timing and amount of future dividend payments will be at the discretion of our board of directors. See Risk Factors-Our ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of Delaware law.\u201d\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we used $307 million for financing activities. Significant highlights of our financing activities included:\nWe maintain and make enhancements to our products, services, technologies and systems in response to technological developments, industry standards, trends, and customer demands. We deploy resources in research and development in order to help maintain a competitive advantage and deliver innovation to the marketplace. Software developed for internal use includes costs incurred to enhance our infrastructure, software applications, and reservation systems. Additionally, we rely on other third-party providers, including DXC, Amazon Web Services, Inc., Google Cloud, and Microsoft Corporation, to operate computer data centers and network systems and provide hosting services. The aggregation of these costs represents our total technology expenditures of $1,034 million, $999 million, and $940 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. These amounts include hosting, third-party software and expensed research and development costs of $945 million, $744 million, and $675 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and capitalized software development expenditures of $89 million, $256 million, and $264 million for these respective periods. This definition of total technology expenditures does not include computer equipment or other property, plant, and equipment. See \"Factors Affecting Our Results-Technology transformation and change in mix of technology spend.\"\nDiscontinued Travelocity Business\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, certain of our stockholders sold an aggregate of 69,304,636 shares of our common stock through secondary public offerings. We did not offer any shares or receive any proceeds from these secondary public offerings. Following the secondary public offering of approximately 23,304,636 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter of 2018, stockholders affiliated with TPG Global, LLC (\"TPG\") and Silver Lake Management Company II, L.L.C. (\"Silver Lake\") no longer held any shares of our common stock.\nInvesting Activities\n(1)Includes all interest and principal of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, senior secured notes due 2023 and finance lease obligations. Under certain circumstances, we are required to pay a percentage of the excess cash flow, if any, generated each year to our lenders which obligation is not reflected in the table above. Interest on the term loan is based on the LIBOR rate plus a base margin and includes the effect of interest rate swaps. For purposes of this table, we have used projected LIBOR rates for all future periods. See Note 8. Debt, to our consolidated financial statements.\n(5)Our letters of credit consist of stand-by letters of credit, underwritten by a group of lenders, which we primarily issue in the normal course of business. The contractual expiration dates of these letters of credit are shown in the table above. There were no claims made against any standby letters of credit during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nResults of Operations\nHospitality Solutions-Revenue increased $20 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by growth in SynXis Software and Services Revenue of $17 million, or 7%, due to an increase in transaction volumes of 22% to 108 million, which includes the migration of certain brands of Wyndham Hotels over the first half of 2018 and early 2019. The migration of these enterprise hotel brands reduced the average rate of our transaction revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 versus the prior year. Additionally, DX service revenue increased $3 million.\nWe capitalize certain costs related to our infrastructure, software applications and reservation systems under authoritative guidance on software developed for internal use during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary and post project development activities are expensed as incurred. When determining whether applicable costs qualify for capitalization, we use judgment in distinguishing between the preliminary project and application development stages of the project and in determining whether these costs result in additional functionality for existing internal use software. In 2019, our development teams substantially completed the transition to utilizing the agile development methodology, which is characterized by a more dynamic development process with iterative activities that involve planning, design, coding and testing. This methodology requires additional review of the stages to ensure the applicable criteria are met for capitalization and may be less likely to meet the criteria for capitalization. As we expected, this transition towards implementing this methodology reduced our capitalization of certain costs with a corresponding increase in our product and technology operating expenses. Costs that cannot be separated\nWe account for significant intersegment transactions as if the transactions were with third parties, that is, at estimated current market prices. Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions pay fees to Travel Network for airline trips and hotel stays booked through our GDS.\n\n\u2022second annual payment in January 2018 on the TRA liability for $59 million, excluding interest;\nWe utilize cash and cash equivalents, supplemented by our Revolver, primarily to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, invest in our information technology infrastructure, products and offerings, pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, make payments under the TRA, pay taxes, and service our debt and other long-term liabilities. On October 15, 2019, we acquired Radixx for $110 million utilizing cash on hand. In addition, we have entered into an agreement to purchase Farelogix for $360 million, which will be funded at closing by cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolver. Under the acquisition agreement, as amended, we have agreed to advance certain attorneys' fees incurred by Farelogix in responding to certain governmental reviews of the acquisition and in defending against certain antitrust proceedings, which have totaled $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These advances will be applied against the purchase price upon closing. The acquisition agreement, as amended, contains certain customary termination rights, including the right of either party to terminate the acquisition agreement if the acquisition has not occurred by April 30, 2020. We could be obligated to pay Farelogix up to an additional $25 million, either in the form of additional advances or in the form of a termination fee depending on the circumstances.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash of $243 million in investing activities, including $107 million used in the acquisition of Radixx, net of cash acquired, and $89 million related to software developed for internal use. Additionally, we used cash of $20 million as an advance of purchase price to Farelogix for certain attorneys' fees. See \"-Liquidity Outlook\" above for additional information on the Farelogix acquisition agreement.\n(2)We lease approximately 1.6 million square feet of office space in 93 locations in 48 countries. Lease payment escalations are based on fixed annual increases, local consumer price index changes or market rental reviews. We have renewal options of various term lengths in approximately 50 leases. We have no purchase options and no restrictions imposed by our leases concerning dividends or additional debt. Also includes future minimum payment obligations for an operating lease commencing in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 11. Leases to our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn 2019, we substantially completed our transition to utilizing the agile development methodology. This method is characterized by a more dynamic development process with iterative activities that involve planning, designing, coding and testing. The agile approach results in more frequent and incremental revisions to software and releases with shorter development cycles that may be less likely to meet the criteria for capitalization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). In addition, we continue to focus our resources on re-platforming efforts as we continue to move to open source and cloud-based solutions. As expected, these continued investments have reduced our capitalization of certain costs, with a corresponding increase in technology operating expenses.\nIn connection with the adoption of ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018, Airline Solutions license fees are recognized upon delivery, while ongoing maintenance services are recognized ratably over the life of the contract. In addition, the allocation of contract revenues among various products and solutions, and the timing of the recognition of those revenues, may be impacted by agreements with tiered pricing or variable rate structures that do not correspond with the goods or services delivered to the customer. See Note 2. Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to our consolidated financial statements, and \"-Recent Developments Affecting our Results of Operations\" above. Revenue may occasionally include amounts from transactions that were partially or fully satisfied in previous periods, but recognized upon the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the amounts involved or changes in estimates.\nOur Travel Network business relies on relationships with several large travel buyers, including TMCs and OTAs, to drive a large portion of its revenue. Although our contracts with larger travel agencies often increase the amount of the incentive consideration when the travel agency processes a certain volume or percentage of its bookings through our GDS, travel buyers are not contractually required to book exclusively through our GDS during the contract term. Travel buyers may shift bookings to other distribution intermediaries for many reasons, including to avoid becoming overly dependent on a single source of travel content and increase their bargaining power with the GDS providers. For example, certain travel agencies have adopted a dual GDS provider strategy and shifted a sizeable portion of their business from our GDS to a competitor GDS, while other agencies have shifted a sizable portion their business to our GDS.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we used cash of $284 million on capital expenditures, which includes capitalized software development of $256 million, consisting of $252 million related to software developed for internal use and $4 million for development of on-premise licensed products.\nGrowth through acquisition and brand consolidation is emerging as a strategy for enterprise hoteliers. This has resulted, and may continue to result, in customer de-migration as larger hotel chains consolidate acquired brands onto their existing technology platforms. Certain of our Hospitality Solutions customers are in the process of being acquired by larger hoteliers, and it is possible that additional customer consolidations could occur in the future. We expect these consolidations to adversely impact revenue growth for the Hospitality Solutions business.\nThe travel industry continues to be adversely affected by the global health crisis due to the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, especially as it relates to air travel to and from Asia. We expect a material impact to our consolidated financial results in the first quarter of 2020. Given the uncertainties surrounding the duration of the outbreak and its impact on global travel, we cannot reasonably estimate the related financial impact to our full-year 2020 financial results; however, we expect the impact will be material.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to: future expected cash flows, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents; the acquired company's brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nRevenue Recognition and Multiple Performance Obligation Arrangements\nRecent insolvencies of certain Airline Solutions customers\n\nMost of the hotel market is highly fragmented. Independent hotels and small to medium sized chains (groups of less than 300 properties) comprise a majority of hotel properties and available hotel rooms, with global and regional chains comprising the balance. Hotels use a number of different technology systems to distribute and market their products and operate efficiently. We offer technology solutions to all segments of the hospitality market. Our SynXis Enterprise Platform integrates critical hospitality systems to optimize distribution, operations, retailing and guest experience via one scalable, flexible and intelligent platform. As these markets continue to grow, we believe both independent and enterprise hotel owners and operators will continue to seek increased connectivity and integrated solutions to ensure access to global travelers. We anticipate that this will contribute to the continued growth of Hospitality Solutions, which is ultimately dependent upon these hoteliers accepting and utilizing our products and services.\nIncreasing importance of LCC/hybrids\n\u2022payment of $45 million on our revolving credit facility and $62 million on our Term Loan A and Term Loan B, offset by proceeds of $45 million from borrowings on our revolving credit facility;\nProvision for Income Taxes\nAirline Solutions-Revenue increased $18 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The $18 million increase in revenue primarily resulted from:\nHospitality Solutions-Cost of revenue increased $38 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a $28 million increase in labor costs and a $4 million increase in technology expenditures, both driven by the execution of our technology strategy, including cloud migration, mainframe offload and utilization of agile development methods, which increases the expensed portion of our total technology spend. Additionally, transaction-related costs increased by $14 million to support the growth of our business. These increases were partially offset by an $8 million reduction in non-development labor costs.\nYears Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nWe had no off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nCapitalized Software Developed for Internal Use\nTransaction revenue for airline travel reservations is recognized by Travel Network at the time of the booking of the reservation, net of estimated future cancellations. Cancellations prior to the day of departure are estimated based on the historical level of cancellation rates, adjusted to take into account any recent factors which could cause a change in those rates. In circumstances where expected cancellation rates or booking behavior changes, our estimates are revised, and in these circumstances, future cancellation rates could vary materially, with a corresponding variation in revenue net of estimated future cancellations. Factors that could have a significant effect on our estimates include global security issues, epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters, general economic conditions, the financial condition of travel suppliers, and travel related accidents.\nLow-cost carriers and hybrid carriers (\"LCC/hybrids\") have become a significant segment of the air travel market, stimulating demand for air travel through low fares. LCC/hybrids have traditionally relied on direct distribution for the majority of their bookings. However, as these LCC/hybrids are evolving, many are increasing their distribution through indirect channels to expand their offering into higher yield markets and to higher yield customers, such as business and international travelers. Other LCC/hybrids, especially start up carriers, may choose not to distribute through the GDS until wider distribution is desired. On October 15, 2019, we acquired Radixx, an airline retailing software provider whose signature products are a LCC passenger service system and internet booking engine. We expect to make additional investments to address the LCC space.", "item_7_text": "\u2022net payments of $6 million from the settlement of employee stock-based awards, including $7 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, net of payments for $13 million in income tax withholdings associated with the settlement of employee stock-based awards.\n\u2022payment of $47 million on our Term Loan A and Term Loan B and $2 million in debt issuance and modification costs;\nRecent Events Impacting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\nGeographic mix of Travel Network\nWe operate in numerous countries where our income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities. Because we operate globally, the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change, and the amounts at issue can be substantial. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a liability, including interest and penalty, of $81 million and $93 million, respectively, for unrecognized tax benefits, of which $63 million and $74 million, respectively, would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the provision for income taxes from continuing operations.\nIn April 2019, a customer of Travel Network and Airline Solutions, Jet Airways suspended flight operations and is now in insolvency proceedings. Our revenue was negatively impacted in 2019 which will continue in 2020.\nAs a result of the enactment of the TCJA, we recorded a one-time transition tax on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We do not consider these undistributed earnings to be indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2019, with certain limited exceptions. We consider the undistributed capital investments in our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2019, and have not provided deferred taxes on any outside basis differences. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries are available to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.\nContinued focus by travel suppliers on cost cutting and exerting influence over distribution\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when impairment indicators exist. We begin our evaluation with a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value before applying a quantitative assessment. If it is determined through the evaluation of events or circumstances that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we perform a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit. If the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of that reporting unit, the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill is reduced to its fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance, resulting in an impairment charge.\nLoss Contingencies\nThere are structural differences between the geographies in which we operate. Due to our geographic concentration, our results of operations are particularly sensitive to factors affecting North America. For example, booking fees per transaction in North America have traditionally been lower than those in Europe. By growing internationally with our TMCs and OTAs customers and expanding the travel content available on our GDS to target regional traveler preferences, we anticipate that we will grow share in North America, Europe and Latin America. We invest for sustainable share growth, and in certain parts of Asia-Pacific and Latin America, our share may be impacted by travel agency deals we have declined to pursue due to credit risk and unfavorable economics. The geographic mix of our Direct Billable Bookings is summarized below:\n\u2022a $13 million increase in AirVision and AirCentre commercial and operations solutions revenue primarily driven by license fee revenue from new implementations recognized upon delivery to the customer as well as an increase in revenue related to services and new implementations; and\nThe following table sets forth these key metrics for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nInformation related to Recent Accounting Pronouncements is included in Note 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nRevenue\nCorporate-Cost of revenue associated with corporate costs increased $3 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in labor costs resulting from the shift to open source and cloud-based solutions as well as an increase in non-development headcount-related expenses.\n\nCost of Revenue\n\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we used $410 million for financing activities. Significant highlights of our financing activities included:\n\u2022repurchase of 1,075,255 shares of our common stock outstanding totaling $26 million; and\nTechnology transformation and change in mix of technology spend\nIn February 2013, Sabre GLBL entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The agreement replaced (i) the existing term loans with new classes of term loans of $1,775 million (the 2013 Term Loan B\u201d) and $425 million (the 2013 Term Loan C\u201d) and (ii) the existing revolving credit facility with a new revolving credit facility of $352 million (the 2013 Revolver\u201d). In September 2013, Sabre GLBL entered into an agreement to amend the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to add a new class of term loans in the amount of $350 million (the 2013 Incremental Term Loan Facility\u201d).\nOn August 23, 2017, Sabre GLBL entered into a Fourth Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, Term Loan A Refinancing Amendment to the Credit Agreement, and Second Revolving Facility Refinancing Amendment to the Credit Agreement to refinance and modify the terms of the 2017 Term Loan B, the 2016 Term Loan A, and the 2016 Revolver, resulting in a reduction of the applicable margins for each of these instruments and approximately a one-year extension of the maturity of the 2016 Term Loan A and 2016 Revolver (the 2017 Refinancing\u201d). We incurred no additional indebtedness as a result of the 2017 Refinancing. The 2017 Refinancing included a $400 million revolving credit facility (\"Revolver\") that replaced the 2016 Revolver, as well as the application of the proceeds of the approximately $1,891 million incremental Term Loan B facility ( Term Loan B\u201d) and $570 million Term Loan A facility ( Term Loan A\u201d) to replace the 2017 Term Loan B and the 2016 Term Loan A. The maturity of the Revolver and the Term Loan A was extended from July 18, 2021 to July 1, 2022. The applicable margins for the Term Loan B were reduced to 2.25% per annum for Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.25% per annum for base rate loans. The applicable margins for the Term Loan A and the Revolver were reduced to (i) between 2.50% and 1.75% per annum for Eurocurrency rate loans and (ii) between 1.50% and 0.75% per annum for base rate loans, in each case with the applicable margin for any quarter reduced by 25 basis points (up to 75 basis points total) if the Senior Secured First-Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) is less than 3.75 to 1.0, 3.00 to 1.0, or 2.25 to 1.0, respectively. The Eurocurrency rate is based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. If a published U.S. dollar LIBOR rate is unavailable, the interest rates on our debt indexed to LIBOR will be determined using various alternative methods set forth in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, any of which could result in interest obligations that are more than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on this debt if U.S. dollar LIBOR were available in its current form. See Risk Factors-We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations.\u201d We anticipate amending our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement prior to the phaseout of LIBOR to provide for a Eurocurrency rate alternative to LIBOR.\n\u2022receipt of net proceeds totaling $2 million from the settlement of employee stock-option awards, including a payment of $10 million in income tax withholdings associated with the settlement of employee restricted-stock awards.\n(3)Represents minimum amounts due to DXC under the terms of an outsourcing agreement through which DXC manages a significant portion of our information technology systems. Also reflects minimum amounts due under an information technology agreement entered into during the first quarter of 2020. Actual payments may vary significantly from the minimum amounts presented.\nIncome and Non-Income Taxes\nDirect Billable Bookings\u201d and Passengers Boarded\u201d are the primary metrics utilized by Travel Network and Airline Solutions, respectively, to measure operating performance. Travel Network generates fees for each Direct Billable Booking which include bookings made through our GDS (e.g., Air, and Lodging, Ground and Sea (\"LGS\")) and through our joint venture partners in cases where we are paid directly by the travel supplier. Passengers Boarded ( PBs\u201d) is the primary metric used by Airline Solutions to recognize SaaS and hosted revenue from recurring usage-based fees. The primary metric utilized by Hospitality Solutions is booking transactions processed through the SynXis Central Reservations System. These key metrics allow management to analyze customer volume over time for each of our three business segments to monitor industry trends and analyze performance. We believe that these key metrics are useful for investors and other third parties as indicators of our financial performance and industry trends. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our transaction counts for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges associated with their measurement. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of these metrics, and these estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology.\nWe believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we established and maintain a valuation allowance on the non-U.S. deferred tax assets of our lastminute.com and other non-US subsidiaries of $33 million and $55 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Also it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain U.S. state deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we established and maintain a valuation allowance on these U.S. state deferred tax assets of $5 million and $4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We reassess these assumptions regularly, which could cause an increase or decrease to the valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in the effective tax rate, and could materially impact our results of operations.\nWe had no balance outstanding under the Revolver as of December 31, 2019 and as of December 31, 2018. We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $12 million and $15 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which reduced our overall credit capacity under the Revolver.\n2016. See Risk Factors-Our travel supplier customers may experience financial instability or consolidation, pursue cost reductions, change their distribution model or undergo other changes.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2018 we have utilized substantially all of our U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and a portion of our available U.S. federal tax credits. As a result, we expect an increase in the amount of our cash taxes in future years, beginning in 2020.\nGoodwill was assigned to each reporting unit based on that reporting unit's percentage of enterprise value as of the date of the acquisition of Sabre Corporation by TPG and Silver Lake plus goodwill associated with acquisitions since that time. We have three reporting units associated with our continuing operations: Travel Network, Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions. Goodwill related to our reporting units totaled $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2019.\nTerm Facility Amendment\n\u2022a $5 million increase in Reservation revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily driven by the acquisition of Radixx and organic growth in our existing customer base. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the volume of Passengers Boarded, which declined 2% to 741 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by the demigration of the Transitioned Customers as well as the impact of Jet Airways' insolvency and the impact of the 737 Max incident on a particular customer.\nShare Repurchase Program\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, to our consolidated financial statements for more information on impacts of ASC 606 to our various streams of revenue recognition.\nbetween maintenance of, and relatively minor upgrades and enhancements to, internal use software are also expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nIn February 2017, our Board approved a $500 million multi-year Share Repurchase Program. Repurchases under the program may take place in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Approximately $287 million remains authorized for repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 3,673,768 shares totaling $78 million pursuant to this Share Repurchase Program. There were no shares repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFor a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 17.7% and 14.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to the impact of 2018 adjustments related to the enactment of the TCJA for deferred taxes and foreign tax effects of $27 million and, in 2019, an unfavorable impact of our geographic mix of taxable income, partially offset by an increase in net favorable U.S. tax permanent differences and certain tax credits and incentives.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are: (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) cash and cash equivalents and (iii) borrowings under our $400 million Revolver (see -Senior Secured Credit Facilities \u201d). Borrowing availability under our Revolver is reduced by our outstanding letters of credit and restricted cash collateral. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our cash and cash equivalents, Revolver and outstanding letters of credit were as follows (in thousands):\nWe consider cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash. Securities with contractual maturities of three months or less, when purchased, are considered cash equivalents. We record changes in a book overdraft position, in which our bank account is not overdrawn but recently issued and outstanding checks result in a negative general ledger balance, as cash flows from financing activities. We invest in a money market fund which is classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows. We held no short-term investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following is a discussion of trends that we believe are the most significant opportunities and challenges currently impacting our business and industry. The discussion also includes management's assessment of the effects these trends have had and are expected to have on our results of continuing operations. This information is not an exhaustive list of all of the factors that could affect our results and should be read in conjunction with the factors referred to in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncreasing travel agency incentive consideration\n\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $725 million and consisted of net income from continuing operations of $341 million, adjustments for non-cash and other items of $607 million and a decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $223 million. The adjustments for non-cash and other items consist primarily of $413 million of depreciation and amortization, $78 million in amortization of upfront incentive consideration, $57 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $43 million of deferred income taxes. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $223 million was primarily the result of $89 million used for upfront incentive consideration, a $75 million increase in accounts receivable, $39 million used for capitalized implementation costs, a $30 million increase in other assets, a $27 million decrease in accounts payable, and a $15 million decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits. These decreases were partially offset by the receipt of $29 million from an insurance settlement, an increase of $8 million in deferred revenues, and a decrease of $14 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nKey Metrics\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, share repurchases, and dividends will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. See Risk Factors-We may require more cash than we generate in our operating activities, and additional funding on reasonable terms or at all may not be available.\u201d\nWe are also required to pay down the term loans by an amount equal to 50% of annual excess cash flow, as defined in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. This percentage requirement may decrease or be eliminated if certain leverage ratios are achieved. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2018, we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment in 2019, and no excess cash flow payment was required in 2020 with respect to our results for the year ended December 31, 2019. We are further required to pay down the term loan with proceeds from certain asset sales or borrowings as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nFurthermore, on an ongoing basis, we will evaluate and consider strategic acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, repurchasing shares of our common stock (including pursuant to our multi-year $500 million share repurchase program (the \"Share Repurchase Program\")) or our outstanding debt obligations in open market or in privately negotiated transactions, as well as other transactions we believe may create stockholder value or enhance financial performance. These transactions may require cash expenditures or generate proceeds and, to the extent they require cash expenditures, may be funded through a combination of cash on hand, debt or equity offerings, or utilization of our Revolver.\nHistorically, large travel suppliers built custom in-house software and applications for their business process needs. In response to a desire for more flexible systems given increasingly complex and constantly changing technological requirements, reduced IT budgets and increased focus on cost efficiency, many travel suppliers turned to third party solutions providers for many of their key technologies and began to license software from software providers. We believe that significant revenue opportunity remains in this outsourcing trend, as legacy in-house systems continue to migrate and upgrade to third party systems. The shift from a model with initial license fees to one with recurring monthly fees associated with our SaaS and hosted solutions, has resulted in an ongoing revenue stream based on the number of passengers boarded. However, under the SaaS and hosted solutions revenue model, revenue recognition may be delayed due to longer implementation schedules for larger suppliers. The SaaS and hosted models' centralized deployment also allows us to save time and money by reducing maintenance and implementation tasks and lowering operating costs.\nOverview\nOn March 2, 2018, Sabre GLBL entered into a Fifth Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to refinance and modify the terms of the Term Loan B as discussed above. See \"-Recent Events Impacting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" above.\nCash Flows\nGrowing demand for continued technology improvements in the fragmented hotel market\n\u2022annual payment on the TRA liability for $101 million, excluding interest;\nThis consideration grew in the double digits on a per booking basis in 2017 and 2018 due to higher incentives in certain geographical markets and from new customer conversions and reverted to single-digit growth in 2019. We expect continued single-digit growth in the near term due to our focus on managing incentive consideration. Although incentive rate increases may continue to impact margins, we expect these increases to be more than offset by growth in Travel Network revenue. This expectation is based in part on our continuing to offer value added services and content to travel buyers, such as the Sabre Red Workspace, a SaaS product that provides a simplified interface and enhanced travel agency workflow and productivity tools.\nWe did not record any goodwill impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The determination of fair value requires us to make significant judgments and estimates including cash flow projections and assumptions related to market participants, the principal markets, and the highest and best use of the reporting units. Changes in the assumptions used in our impairment testing may result in future impairment losses which could have a material impact on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each of our three reporting units by more than 10%.\nAir Booking Cancellation Reserve\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a comparison of our Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and our Cash Flow discussion for the year ended December 31, 2017, see \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC on February 15, 2019.\nRecent Developments Affecting our Results of Operations\nCash flows used in discontinued operating activities were $2 million, $2 million, and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cash flows used by discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, primarily resulted from expenses associated with legal contingencies related to hotel occupancy taxes.\n(8)Excludes pension obligations, see Note 15. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans, to our consolidated financial statements.\nOn March 2, 2018, Sabre GLBL entered into a Fifth Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to refinance and modify the terms of the Term Loan B, resulting in a reduction of the applicable margins for the Term Loan B to 2.00% per annum for Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.00% per annum for base rate loans. We incurred no additional indebtedness as a result of this transaction and incurred $2 million in financing fees recorded within Other, net and a $1 million loss extinguishment of debt in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCost of revenue\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe believe that cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand and our Revolver provide adequate liquidity for our operational and capital expenditures and other obligations over the next twelve months, as well as funding our acquisition of Farelogix. We are reviewing opportunities to refinance Term Loan A, Term Loan B, and our Revolver, depending on market conditions. This refinancing may include a debt issuance, a reallocation between Term Loan A and Term Loan B and an extension of the maturity date of Term Loan A and our revolver. We may supplement our current liquidity through debt or equity offerings to support future strategic investments, or to pay down debt including debt offerings to pay down a portion of our outstanding debt. We funded TRA payments of $72 million, $74 million, and $60 million, including interest, due in January 2020, January 2019 and January 2018, respectively, with cash on hand.\nRevenues\nDepreciation and amortization-Depreciation and amortization decreased $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to customer implementations that became fully amortized during the year, partially offset by additional depreciation related to the completion of software developed for internal use.\nThe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing include: (i) the discount rate, (ii) the expected long-term growth rate and (iii) annual cash flow projections. See Note 10. Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements.\nTravel Network-Cost of revenue increased $158 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, partially as a result of a $71 million increase in incentive consideration primarily due to volume growth in North America bookings as well as rate increases across all regions. The increase is also driven by a $69 million increase in labor costs and a $19 million increase in technology expenditures, both driven by the execution of our technology strategy, including cloud migration, mainframe offload and utilization of agile development methods, which increases the expensed portion of our total technology spend.\nOn October 15, 2019, we acquired Radixx, a leading airline retailing software provider for $110 million, utilizing cash on hand. Radixx is being integrated and is managed as a part of our Airline Solutions segment.\nOur accounting policies that include significant estimates and assumptions include: (i) estimation for revenue recognition and multiple performance obligation arrangements, (ii) determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, (iii) the evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and goodwill, (iv) assumptions utilized to test recoverability of capitalized implementation costs, (v) judgments in capitalization of software developed for internal use, and (vi) the evaluation of uncertainties surrounding the calculation of our tax assets and liabilities. We regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate\u201d if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation and if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur and could have a material effect on the presentation of financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies, contingent consideration, where applicable, and previously-held investment interests. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nTravel Network primarily generates revenues from Direct Billable Bookings processed on our GDS as well as the sale of aggregated bookings data to carriers. Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions primarily generate revenue through upfront solution fees and recurring usage-based fees for the use of our software solutions hosted on secure platforms or deployed through our SaaS and through other professional service fees including Digital Experience (\"DX\"). Certain professional service fees are discrete sales opportunities that may have a high degree of variability from period to period, and we cannot guarantee that we will have such fees in the future consistent with prior periods. Airline Solutions also generates revenue through software licensing and maintenance fees. Recognition of license fees upon delivery has previously resulted and will continue to result in periodic fluctuations in revenue recognized.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that sell our services to new customers and administratively support the business, information technology and communication costs, professional service fees, certain settlement charges or reimbursements, costs to defend legal disputes, bad debt expense, depreciation and amortization and other overhead costs.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated through transaction based fees that we charge to our customers. For Travel Network, this fee is in the form of a transaction fee for bookings on our GDS; for Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions, this fee is a recurring usage-based fee for the use of our SaaS and hosted systems, as well as upfront fees and professional service fees. Items that are not allocated to our business segments are identified as corporate and primarily include stock-based compensation expense, litigation costs, corporate headcount-related costs and other items that are not identifiable with either one of our segments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded final adjustments to our provisional amounts recognized related to the TCJA, resulting in a decrease in our provision for income taxes from continuing operations of $27 million for deferred tax assets and foreign tax effects (see Note 7. Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements).\nDividends\nContractual Obligations\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates, and our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary under different assumptions and conditions. In addition, our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard.\nAuthoritative guidance for business combinations requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\n(7)We made payments, including interest, of $72 million in January 2020. See Note 7. Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources-Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d\nTravel agency incentive consideration is a large portion of Travel Network expenses. The vast majority of incentive consideration is tied to absolute booking volumes based on transactions such as flight segments booked. Incentive consideration, which often increases once a certain volume or percentage of bookings is met, is provided in two ways, according to the terms of the agreement: (i) on a periodic basis over the term of the contract and (ii) in some instances, up front at the inception or modification of contracts, which is capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the contract.\nWhile certain legal proceedings and related indemnification obligations and certain tax matters to which we are a party specify the amounts claimed, these claims may not represent reasonably possible losses. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation and tax claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted, nor can the amount of possible loss or range of loss, if any, be reasonably estimated, except in circumstances where an aggregate litigation accrual has been recorded for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new information or developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations.\n\nDepreciation and amortization included in cost of revenue is associated with property and equipment, amortization of capitalized implementation costs which relates to Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions, intangible assets for technology purchased through acquisitions or established with our take private transaction in 2007, and software developed for internal use that supports our revenue, businesses and systems. Cost of revenue also includes amortization of upfront incentive consideration representing upfront payments or other consideration provided to travel agencies for reservations made on our GDS which are capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the contract.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\n________________________________________________________________________________________\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\n\u2022payment of $154 million in dividends on our common stock;\nOn February 22, 2017, Sabre GLBL entered into a Third Incremental Term Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2017 Term Facility Amendment\u201d). The new agreement replaced the 2013 Term Loan B, 2013 Term Loan C, and 2013 Incremental Term Loan Facility with a single class of term loan (the \"2017 Term Loan B\") with an aggregate principal amount of $1,900 million maturing on February 22, 2024. The proceeds of $1,898 million, net of $2 million discount on the 2017 Term Loan B, were used to pay off approximately $1,761 million of all existing classes of outstanding term loans (other than the 2016 Term Loan A), pay related accrued interest and pay $12 million in associated financing fees, which were recorded as debt modification costs in Other, net in the consolidated statement of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The remaining proceeds of the 2017 Term Loan B were used to pay off approximately $80 million of Sabre's outstanding mortgage on its corporate headquarters on March 31, 2017 and for other general corporate purposes. Unamortized debt issuance costs and discount related to existing classes of outstanding term loans prior to the 2017 Term\nImmediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering, we entered into the TRA that provides the stockholders and equity award holders that were our stockholders and equity award holders, respectively, immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering (collectively, the \"Pre-IPO Existing Stockholders\") the right to receive future payments from us equal to 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal income tax that we and our subsidiaries realize as a result of the utilization of certain tax assets attributable to periods prior to our initial public offerings, including NOLs, capital losses and the ability to realize tax amortization of certain intangible assets (collectively, the \"Pre-IPO Tax Assets\"). In connection with the TRA, we made payments, including interest, of $72 million in January 2020, $30 million in April 2019, and $74 million, $60 million and $101 million in January 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In December 2019, we exercised our right under the terms of the TRA to accelerate our remaining payments under the TRA and make an early termination payment of $1 million, to the Pre-IPO Existing Shareholders, which was included in the January 2020 payment of $72 million described above. As a result, no future payments are required to be made to the Pre-IPO Existing Stockholders under the TRA.\nTravel Network-Revenue increased $76 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in transaction-based revenue of $75 million to $2,709 million. The increase in revenue primarily resulted from a 1% increase in Direct Billable Bookings to 566 million and growth in the average booking fee rate during the year ended December 31, 2019 due to a discrete shift in the distribution pricing structure for specific European carriers and favorable mix primarily resulting from growth in hotel bookings which have a higher rate.\nOperating Activities\nThe professional and implementation services are generally performed in the early stages of the agreements. Access to our GDS is provided over the full term of the contract. Software solutions through SaaS and hosted delivery are often not provided until implementation services are completed. We evaluate revenue recognition for agreements with customers which generally are represented by individual contracts but could include groups of contracts if the contracts are executed at or near the same time. Typically, access to our GDS and our professional service fees are separated from the implementation and software hosting services. We account for separate performance obligations on an individual basis with value assigned to each performance obligation based on our best estimate of relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\"). Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. SSP is assessed annually using a historical analysis of contracts with customers executed in the most recently completed calendar year to determine the range of selling prices applicable to a distinct good or service. In making these judgments, we analyze various factors, including discounting practices, price lists, contract prices, value differentiators, customer segmentation and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers. As our market strategies evolve, we may modify pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to SSP.\n\nImpact of customer consolidation in Hospitality Solutions\nIntersegment Transactions\nDepending on the circumstances, the fair value of contingent consideration is determined based on management's best estimate of fair value given the specific facts and circumstances of the contractual arrangement, considering the likelihood of payment, payment terms and management's best estimates of future performance results on the acquisition date, if applicable.\nWe have included below a discussion of the accounting policies involving material estimates and assumptions that we believe are most critical to the preparation of our financial statements, how we apply such policies and how results differing from our estimates and assumptions would affect the amounts presented in our financial statements. We have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these accounting policies with our Audit Committee. Although we believe these policies to be the most critical, other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements and certain of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions. For further information about our significant accounting policies, see Note 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements.\nCapitalized implementation costs represents upfront costs to implement new customer contracts under our SaaS and hosted revenue model. Capitalized implementation costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contract term, ranging from three to ten years, as they are recoverable through deferred or future revenues associated with the relevant contract. These assets are reviewed for recoverability on a periodic basis or when an event occurs that could impact the recoverability of the assets, such as a significant contract modification or early renewal of contract terms. Recoverability is measured based on the future estimated revenue and direct costs of the contract compared to the capitalized implementation costs. We record an impairment charge for the portion of the asset considered unrecoverable in the period identified, while considering the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts and judgments made in estimating revenue and direct costs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $2 million in impairments associated with unrecoverable amounts in capitalized implementation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $4 million in impairments associated with unrecoverable amounts in capitalized implementation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, given the substantial amount of uncertainty of reaching an agreement regarding the implementation of services pursuant to the contract with a customer in our Airline Solutions business, we assessed recoverability of all balances with the customer which resulted in an impairment charge totaling $81 million, which included related capitalized implementation costs. See Note 4. Impairment and Related Charges, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDeferred customer advances and discounts are amortized against revenue in future periods as the related revenue is earned. Our contract assets include revenue recognized for services already transferred to a customer, for which the fulfillment of another contractual performance obligation is required, before we have the unconditional right to bill and collect based on contract terms. Contract assets are reviewed for recoverability on a periodic basis based on a review of impairment indicators. Deferred customer advances and discounts are reviewed for recoverability based on future contracted revenues and estimated direct costs of the contract when a significant event occurs that could impact the recoverability of the assets, such as a significant contract modification or early renewal of contract terms. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not impair any of these assets as a result of the related contracts becoming uncollectable, modified or canceled. See Note 4. Impairment and Related Charges regarding 2017 impairments. Contracts are priced to generate total revenues over the life of the contract that exceed any discounts or advances provided and any upfront costs incurred to implement the customer contract.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance's or contingency's estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur agreements with customers of our Airline Solutions business may have multiple performance obligations which generally include software solutions through SaaS and hosted delivery, professional service fees and implementation services. In addition, from time to time, we enter into agreements with customers to provide access to Travel Network's GDS and, at or near the same time, enter into a separate agreement to provide software solutions through SaaS and hosted delivery. These multiple performance obligation arrangements involve judgments, including estimates of the selling prices of goods and services, attribution of variable consideration, assessments of the likelihood of nonpayment and estimates of total costs and costs to complete a project.\n_______________________\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are assigned depreciable lives of two to thirty years, depending on classification, and are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of definite-lived intangible assets used in combination to generate cash flows largely independent of other assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist for definite-lived intangible assets, the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the expected service potential of the assets are compared to the carrying value of the assets. If our projection of undiscounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the intangible assets, no impairment charge is recorded. If our projection of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, the intangible assets are then measured at fair value and an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value of the assets over its fair value. We also evaluate the need for additional impairment disclosures based on our Level 3 inputs. For fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we disclose the valuation processes used by the reporting entity. We did not record material intangible asset impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n(6)Unrecognized tax benefits include associated interest and penalties. The timing of related cash payments for substantially all of these liabilities is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control.\nAirline Solutions-Cost of revenue increased $46 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily a result of a $62 million increase in labor costs and a $7 million increase in technology expenditures, both driven by the execution of our technology strategy, including cloud migration, mainframe offload and utilization of agile development methods, which increases the expensed portion of our total technology spend. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in non-development labor costs and benefits-related costs of $23 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations were as follows (in thousands):\nFactors Affecting our Results\nIn addition, future revenues may be negatively impacted by, among other things, reduced sales of our software solutions and lower growth in Passengers Boarded due to delayed or uncertain implementations and insolvencies of airline carriers, such as Alitalia Compagnia Aerea Italiana S.p.A. operating as Alitalia ( Alitalia\u201d), that implemented our services in the fourth quarter of\nShift to SaaS and hosted solutions by airlines and hotels to manage their daily operations\nThe differences between our effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily resulted from our geographic mix of taxable income in various tax jurisdictions, tax permanent differences and tax credits.\nIn July 2016, Sabre GLBL entered into a series of amendments (the Credit Agreement Amendments\u201d) to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to provide for an incremental term loan under a new class with an aggregate principal amount of $600 million (the 2016 Term Loan A\u201d) and to replace the 2013 Revolver with a new revolving credit facility totaling $400 million (the 2016 Revolver\u201d). The proceeds of $597 million, net of $3 million discount, from the 2016 Term Loan A were used to repay $350 million of outstanding principal on our 2013 Term Loan B and 2013 Incremental Term Loan Facility, on a pro rata basis, repay the $120 million then-outstanding balance on the 2016 Revolver, and pay $11 million in associated financing fees. We recognized a $4 million loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with these transactions during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nUnder the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the loan parties are subject to certain customary non-financial covenants, including certain restrictions on incurring certain types of indebtedness, creation of liens on certain assets, making of certain investments, and payment of dividends, as well as a maximum leverage ratio. Pursuant to Credit Agreement Amendments, effective July 18, 2016, the maximum leverage ratio has been adjusted to be based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) and we are required, at all times (no longer solely when a threshold amount of revolving loans or letters of credit were outstanding), to maintain a Total Net Leverage Ratio of less than 4.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2019 we are in compliance with all covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nTravel suppliers continue to look for ways to decrease their costs and to increase their control over distribution. Airline consolidations, pricing pressure during contract renegotiations and the use of direct distribution may continue to subject our business to challenges. The shift from indirect distribution channels, such as our GDS, to direct distribution channels, may result from increased content availability on supplier operated websites or from increased participation of meta search engines, such as Kayak and Google, which direct consumers to supplier operated websites. This trend may adversely affect our Travel Network contract renegotiations with suppliers that use alternative distribution channels. For example, airlines may withhold part of their content for distribution exclusively through their own direct distribution channels or offer more attractive terms for content available through those direct channels. This occurred in 2018 when certain European carriers began to withhold part of their content from our GDS to make use of alternative distribution channels, which may adversely affect our future revenue growth. However, in North America, which is our largest region, the rate at which bookings have shifted from indirect to direct distribution channels has been relatively consistent for a number of reasons, including the increased participation of LCC/hybrids in direct channels. Over the last several years, notable carriers that previously only distributed directly, including JetBlue, Norwegian and Interjet, have adopted our GDS. Other carriers such as EVA Airways, and Virgin Australia have further increased their participation in a GDS. Conversely, Air India, Ltd. fully migrated from our GDS during 2019.\nWe announced on November 14, 2018 that we have entered into an agreement to purchase Farelogix, a travel industry innovator in the airline information technology and distribution landscape for $360 million, which will be funded at closing by cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolver. On August 20, 2019, the DOJ filed a complaint seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the acquisition. The trial concluded on February 6, 2020 and the trial court has not yet issued its decision. In addition, the CMA has referred its review of the acquisition for a Phase 2 investigation and has published its provisional findings of competition concerns. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. There can be no assurance that the acquisition will occur on these terms or at all. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant fees associated with this acquisition, including for the items discussed above, which are included in general and administrative expense.\n\nUpon completion of our technology transformation in 2024, we expect to benefit from lower cloud infrastructure costs and higher margins. We believe that continued investment in our technology will help to provide us the necessary framework and infrastructure for a secure and stable architecture for our customers, grow our addressable market, provide new revenue opportunities, reduce costs and will help to improve sales of our software solutions. However, there are various risks associated with our technology transformation efforts, including not achieving the amount of anticipated cost savings, not completing the steps during their current projected time frame, or changing the approach leading to, among other things, additional changes in our mix of technology spend between operating expense and capitalization.\n(1) Direct Billable Bookings\u201d is the primary metric utilized by Travel Network to measure operating performance and includes bookings made through our GDS and through our joint venture partners in cases where we are paid directly by the travel supplier.\nTravel buyers can shift their bookings to or from our Travel Network business\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the comprehensive update to revenue recognition guidance for Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\"), which replaced the previous standard (\"ASC 605\"), using the modified retrospective approach. Under the updated standard, revenue is recognized when a company transfers the promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods and services. See Note 2.\n(4)Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of December 31, 2019. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.\n\u2022repurchase of 3,673,768 shares of our common stock outstanding totaling $78 million; and\nRevenue recognition from our Airline Solutions business requires significant judgments such as identifying distinct performance obligations including material rights within an agreement, estimating the total contract consideration and allocating amounts to each distinct performance obligation, determining whether variable pricing within a contract meets the allocation objective, and forecasting future volumes. For a small subset of our contracts, we are required to forecast volumes as a result of pricing variability within the contract in order to calculate the rate for revenue recognition. Any changes in these judgments and estimates could have an impact on the revenue recognized in future periods.\nWe expect to further enable our technology transformation with incremental investments of approximately $150 million in 2020 and continued investment over the next few years which will have a material impact on our financial results. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our re-platforming efforts to open source and cloud-based solutions, as previously disclosed, with the goal of modernizing our architecture, driving efficiency in development and ongoing technology costs, further enhancing the stability and security of our network, and complying with data privacy regulations, and in next-generation retailing capabilities, including NDC and personalized offers, LCC, and full-service hotel PMS offerings. In 2020, we expect total capital expenditures to range from $80 million to $120 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we capitalized $89 million, $252 million, and $251 million, respectively, related to software developed for internal use.\nCost of revenue incurred by Travel Network, Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions consists of expenses related to technology operations including hosting, third-party software and expensed research and development labor costs, other salaries and benefits, and allocated overhead such as facilities and other support costs. Cost of revenue for Travel Network also includes incentive consideration expense representing payments or other consideration to travel agencies for reservations made on our GDS which accrue on a monthly basis.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review deferred tax assets by jurisdiction to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized. In performing this review, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. A change in these assumptions could cause an increase or decrease to the valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in the effective tax rate, which could materially impact our results of operations. At year end, we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances.\nCorporate cost of revenue includes expenses associated with our technology organization such as corporate systems and risk and security. Corporate cost of revenue also includes certain expenses such as stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, legal reserves and other items not identifiable with one of our segments.\nTechnology Expenditures\nIn April 2019, a customer of Travel Network and Airline Solutions, Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (\"Jet Airways\"), suspended flight operations and is now in insolvency proceedings. Our revenue was negatively impacted in 2019, and this negative impact will continue in 2020. This insolvency, coupled with the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and channel shift related to certain European carriers, has negatively impacted our revenue growth and contributed to reduced growth rates in the GDS industry. We expect this trend to persist into 2020. In addition, our revenue was negatively impacted in 2019 from the effects of the 737 MAX incident on one particular carrier, and we expect this negative impact will continue in 2020. Finally, for Airline Solutions, Pakistan International Airlines Corporation, Bangkok Airways Public Company Limited, and Philippine Airlines, Inc. (the \"Transitioned Customers\"), previously made decisions in 2018 to transition from our services, which will dilute our growth rates on a year-over-year basis. Pakistan International Airlines, Philippine Airlines, and Bangkok Airways Public Company Limited transitioned in September 2018, March 2019, and August 2019, respectively.\nLiquidity Outlook\nThese trends have impacted the revenue of Travel Network, which recognizes revenue for airline ticket sales based on transaction volumes. Simultaneously, this focus on cost cutting and direct distribution has also presented opportunities for Airline Solutions. Many airlines have turned to outside providers for key systems, process and industry expertise and other products that assist in their cost cutting initiatives in order to focus on their primary revenue generating activities.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $581 million and consisted of net income from continuing operations of $164 million, adjustments for non-cash and other items of $568 million and a decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $151 million. The adjustments for non-cash and other items consist primarily of $415 million of depreciation and amortization, $83 million in amortization of upfront incentive consideration, $67 million of stock-based compensation expense, $23 million of deferred income taxes, and $21 million allowance for doubtful accounts. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $151 million was primarily the result of $71 million used for upfront incentive consideration, $34 million increase in accounts receivable, $29 million used for capitalized implementation costs, $27 million decrease in accounts payable, $17 million decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits, and a $12 million decrease in deferred revenues. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease of $39 million in other assets and a decrease of $1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nAmortization of upfront incentive consideration-Amortization of upfront incentive consideration increased $5 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in upfront consideration provided to travel agencies.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $63 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in our legal costs associated with the potential acquisition of Farelogix of $41 million, an increase in labor costs of $24 million, an increase in technology costs of $14 million related to strategic investments in cybersecurity and corporate systems, an increase in bad debt expense of $13 million, and an increase in other antitrust litigation expenses of $3 million. The increase was partially offset by the reversal of our previously accrued loss related to the US Airways legal matter for $32 million. See Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nSecondary Public Offerings\nCapitalized Implementation Costs\nWe connect people and places with technology that reimagines the business of travel. We operate through three business segments: (i) Travel Network, our global business-to-business travel marketplace for travel suppliers and travel buyers, (ii) Airline Solutions, a broad portfolio of software technology products and solutions primarily for airlines, and (iii) Hospitality Solutions, an extensive suite of leading software solutions for hoteliers. Collectively, these offerings enable travel suppliers to better serve their customers across the entire travel lifecycle, from route planning to post-trip business intelligence and analytics.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for each of the periods presented (in thousands):\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\u2022payment of $154 million in dividends on our common stock;\nFacility Amendment of $9 million and $3 million, respectively, will continue to be amortized over the remaining term of the 2017 Term Loan B along with the Term Loan B discount of $2 million. See Note 9. Derivatives, to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the discontinuation of hedge accounting related to our existing interest rate swaps as a result of the 2017 Term Facility Amendment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock totaling $154 million and expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends thereafter. Our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.14 per share of our common stock, which will be paid on March 30, 2020 to stockholders of record as of March 20, 2020. We funded the 2019 dividends, and intend to fund any future dividends, from cash generated from our operations. Future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and the amount of cash dividends per share will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions, number of shares of common stock outstanding and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant. The timing and amount of future dividend payments will be at the discretion of our board of directors. See Risk Factors-Our ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of Delaware law.\u201d\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we used $307 million for financing activities. Significant highlights of our financing activities included:\nWe maintain and make enhancements to our products, services, technologies and systems in response to technological developments, industry standards, trends, and customer demands. We deploy resources in research and development in order to help maintain a competitive advantage and deliver innovation to the marketplace. Software developed for internal use includes costs incurred to enhance our infrastructure, software applications, and reservation systems. Additionally, we rely on other third-party providers, including DXC, Amazon Web Services, Inc., Google Cloud, and Microsoft Corporation, to operate computer data centers and network systems and provide hosting services. The aggregation of these costs represents our total technology expenditures of $1,034 million, $999 million, and $940 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. These amounts include hosting, third-party software and expensed research and development costs of $945 million, $744 million, and $675 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and capitalized software development expenditures of $89 million, $256 million, and $264 million for these respective periods. This definition of total technology expenditures does not include computer equipment or other property, plant, and equipment. See \"Factors Affecting Our Results-Technology transformation and change in mix of technology spend.\"\nDiscontinued Travelocity Business\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, certain of our stockholders sold an aggregate of 69,304,636 shares of our common stock through secondary public offerings. We did not offer any shares or receive any proceeds from these secondary public offerings. Following the secondary public offering of approximately 23,304,636 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter of 2018, stockholders affiliated with TPG Global, LLC (\"TPG\") and Silver Lake Management Company II, L.L.C. (\"Silver Lake\") no longer held any shares of our common stock.\nInvesting Activities\n(1)Includes all interest and principal of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, senior secured notes due 2023 and finance lease obligations. Under certain circumstances, we are required to pay a percentage of the excess cash flow, if any, generated each year to our lenders which obligation is not reflected in the table above. Interest on the term loan is based on the LIBOR rate plus a base margin and includes the effect of interest rate swaps. For purposes of this table, we have used projected LIBOR rates for all future periods. See Note 8. Debt, to our consolidated financial statements.\n(5)Our letters of credit consist of stand-by letters of credit, underwritten by a group of lenders, which we primarily issue in the normal course of business. The contractual expiration dates of these letters of credit are shown in the table above. There were no claims made against any standby letters of credit during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nResults of Operations\nHospitality Solutions-Revenue increased $20 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by growth in SynXis Software and Services Revenue of $17 million, or 7%, due to an increase in transaction volumes of 22% to 108 million, which includes the migration of certain brands of Wyndham Hotels over the first half of 2018 and early 2019. The migration of these enterprise hotel brands reduced the average rate of our transaction revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 versus the prior year. Additionally, DX service revenue increased $3 million.\nWe capitalize certain costs related to our infrastructure, software applications and reservation systems under authoritative guidance on software developed for internal use during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary and post project development activities are expensed as incurred. When determining whether applicable costs qualify for capitalization, we use judgment in distinguishing between the preliminary project and application development stages of the project and in determining whether these costs result in additional functionality for existing internal use software. In 2019, our development teams substantially completed the transition to utilizing the agile development methodology, which is characterized by a more dynamic development process with iterative activities that involve planning, design, coding and testing. This methodology requires additional review of the stages to ensure the applicable criteria are met for capitalization and may be less likely to meet the criteria for capitalization. As we expected, this transition towards implementing this methodology reduced our capitalization of certain costs with a corresponding increase in our product and technology operating expenses. Costs that cannot be separated\nWe account for significant intersegment transactions as if the transactions were with third parties, that is, at estimated current market prices. Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions pay fees to Travel Network for airline trips and hotel stays booked through our GDS.\n\n\u2022second annual payment in January 2018 on the TRA liability for $59 million, excluding interest;\nWe utilize cash and cash equivalents, supplemented by our Revolver, primarily to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, invest in our information technology infrastructure, products and offerings, pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, make payments under the TRA, pay taxes, and service our debt and other long-term liabilities. On October 15, 2019, we acquired Radixx for $110 million utilizing cash on hand. In addition, we have entered into an agreement to purchase Farelogix for $360 million, which will be funded at closing by cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolver. Under the acquisition agreement, as amended, we have agreed to advance certain attorneys' fees incurred by Farelogix in responding to certain governmental reviews of the acquisition and in defending against certain antitrust proceedings, which have totaled $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These advances will be applied against the purchase price upon closing. The acquisition agreement, as amended, contains certain customary termination rights, including the right of either party to terminate the acquisition agreement if the acquisition has not occurred by April 30, 2020. We could be obligated to pay Farelogix up to an additional $25 million, either in the form of additional advances or in the form of a termination fee depending on the circumstances.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash of $243 million in investing activities, including $107 million used in the acquisition of Radixx, net of cash acquired, and $89 million related to software developed for internal use. Additionally, we used cash of $20 million as an advance of purchase price to Farelogix for certain attorneys' fees. See \"-Liquidity Outlook\" above for additional information on the Farelogix acquisition agreement.\n(2)We lease approximately 1.6 million square feet of office space in 93 locations in 48 countries. Lease payment escalations are based on fixed annual increases, local consumer price index changes or market rental reviews. We have renewal options of various term lengths in approximately 50 leases. We have no purchase options and no restrictions imposed by our leases concerning dividends or additional debt. Also includes future minimum payment obligations for an operating lease commencing in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 11. Leases to our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn 2019, we substantially completed our transition to utilizing the agile development methodology. This method is characterized by a more dynamic development process with iterative activities that involve planning, designing, coding and testing. The agile approach results in more frequent and incremental revisions to software and releases with shorter development cycles that may be less likely to meet the criteria for capitalization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). In addition, we continue to focus our resources on re-platforming efforts as we continue to move to open source and cloud-based solutions. As expected, these continued investments have reduced our capitalization of certain costs, with a corresponding increase in technology operating expenses.\nIn connection with the adoption of ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018, Airline Solutions license fees are recognized upon delivery, while ongoing maintenance services are recognized ratably over the life of the contract. In addition, the allocation of contract revenues among various products and solutions, and the timing of the recognition of those revenues, may be impacted by agreements with tiered pricing or variable rate structures that do not correspond with the goods or services delivered to the customer. See Note 2. Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to our consolidated financial statements, and \"-Recent Developments Affecting our Results of Operations\" above. Revenue may occasionally include amounts from transactions that were partially or fully satisfied in previous periods, but recognized upon the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the amounts involved or changes in estimates.\nOur Travel Network business relies on relationships with several large travel buyers, including TMCs and OTAs, to drive a large portion of its revenue. Although our contracts with larger travel agencies often increase the amount of the incentive consideration when the travel agency processes a certain volume or percentage of its bookings through our GDS, travel buyers are not contractually required to book exclusively through our GDS during the contract term. Travel buyers may shift bookings to other distribution intermediaries for many reasons, including to avoid becoming overly dependent on a single source of travel content and increase their bargaining power with the GDS providers. For example, certain travel agencies have adopted a dual GDS provider strategy and shifted a sizeable portion of their business from our GDS to a competitor GDS, while other agencies have shifted a sizable portion their business to our GDS.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we used cash of $284 million on capital expenditures, which includes capitalized software development of $256 million, consisting of $252 million related to software developed for internal use and $4 million for development of on-premise licensed products.\nGrowth through acquisition and brand consolidation is emerging as a strategy for enterprise hoteliers. This has resulted, and may continue to result, in customer de-migration as larger hotel chains consolidate acquired brands onto their existing technology platforms. Certain of our Hospitality Solutions customers are in the process of being acquired by larger hoteliers, and it is possible that additional customer consolidations could occur in the future. We expect these consolidations to adversely impact revenue growth for the Hospitality Solutions business.\nThe travel industry continues to be adversely affected by the global health crisis due to the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, especially as it relates to air travel to and from Asia. We expect a material impact to our consolidated financial results in the first quarter of 2020. Given the uncertainties surrounding the duration of the outbreak and its impact on global travel, we cannot reasonably estimate the related financial impact to our full-year 2020 financial results; however, we expect the impact will be material.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to: future expected cash flows, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents; the acquired company's brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nRevenue Recognition and Multiple Performance Obligation Arrangements\nRecent insolvencies of certain Airline Solutions customers\n\nMost of the hotel market is highly fragmented. Independent hotels and small to medium sized chains (groups of less than 300 properties) comprise a majority of hotel properties and available hotel rooms, with global and regional chains comprising the balance. Hotels use a number of different technology systems to distribute and market their products and operate efficiently. We offer technology solutions to all segments of the hospitality market. Our SynXis Enterprise Platform integrates critical hospitality systems to optimize distribution, operations, retailing and guest experience via one scalable, flexible and intelligent platform. As these markets continue to grow, we believe both independent and enterprise hotel owners and operators will continue to seek increased connectivity and integrated solutions to ensure access to global travelers. We anticipate that this will contribute to the continued growth of Hospitality Solutions, which is ultimately dependent upon these hoteliers accepting and utilizing our products and services.\nIncreasing importance of LCC/hybrids\n\u2022payment of $45 million on our revolving credit facility and $62 million on our Term Loan A and Term Loan B, offset by proceeds of $45 million from borrowings on our revolving credit facility;\nProvision for Income Taxes\nAirline Solutions-Revenue increased $18 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The $18 million increase in revenue primarily resulted from:\nHospitality Solutions-Cost of revenue increased $38 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a $28 million increase in labor costs and a $4 million increase in technology expenditures, both driven by the execution of our technology strategy, including cloud migration, mainframe offload and utilization of agile development methods, which increases the expensed portion of our total technology spend. Additionally, transaction-related costs increased by $14 million to support the growth of our business. These increases were partially offset by an $8 million reduction in non-development labor costs.\nYears Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nWe had no off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nCapitalized Software Developed for Internal Use\nTransaction revenue for airline travel reservations is recognized by Travel Network at the time of the booking of the reservation, net of estimated future cancellations. Cancellations prior to the day of departure are estimated based on the historical level of cancellation rates, adjusted to take into account any recent factors which could cause a change in those rates. In circumstances where expected cancellation rates or booking behavior changes, our estimates are revised, and in these circumstances, future cancellation rates could vary materially, with a corresponding variation in revenue net of estimated future cancellations. Factors that could have a significant effect on our estimates include global security issues, epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters, general economic conditions, the financial condition of travel suppliers, and travel related accidents.\nLow-cost carriers and hybrid carriers (\"LCC/hybrids\") have become a significant segment of the air travel market, stimulating demand for air travel through low fares. LCC/hybrids have traditionally relied on direct distribution for the majority of their bookings. However, as these LCC/hybrids are evolving, many are increasing their distribution through indirect channels to expand their offering into higher yield markets and to higher yield customers, such as business and international travelers. Other LCC/hybrids, especially start up carriers, may choose not to distribute through the GDS until wider distribution is desired. On October 15, 2019, we acquired Radixx, an airline retailing software provider whose signature products are a LCC passenger service system and internet booking engine. We expect to make additional investments to address the LCC space.", "item_7_tables": "Table 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Net payments of $6 million were made from the settlement of employee stock-based awards. This included $7 million in proceeds from employee stock options exercises, offset by $13 million in income tax withholdings on settled awards.\n\n- $47 million was paid on Term Loan A and Term Loan B debt, along with $2 million in debt issuance and modification costs. \n\n- Key metrics: Travel Network had 566 million Direct Billable Bookings, up 1.4% year-over-year. Airline Solutions had 741 million Passengers Boarded, down 1.5%. Hospitality Solutions had 108 million Central Reservations System Transactions, up 22.4%.\n\n- Revenue was up 3% to $4 billion, driven by growth in Travel Network and Hospitality Solutions. Cost of revenue increased 9% to $3 billion, mostly due to higher incentive consideration costs. \n\n- Net income from continuing operations was $164 million, down from $341 million last year. The tax provision decreased to $35 million from $57 million.\n\n- The company used $410 million for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividend payments, and share repurchases. \n\n- Recent events like Jet Airways' insolvency are expected to negatively impact future revenue growth. The shift to direct distribution channels also remains a challenge.\n\n- The company continues to invest significantly in its technology transformation and move to open source and cloud-based solutions. This is driving an increase in expensed technology spend.\n\nIn summary, the company saw moderate revenue growth but faced challenges from airline industry dynamics. It continues to invest in long-term technology improvements while managing costs and debt obligations."}
