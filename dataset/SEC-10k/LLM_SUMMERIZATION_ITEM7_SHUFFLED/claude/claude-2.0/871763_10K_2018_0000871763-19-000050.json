Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFinancial Measures - Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency\nChanges in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and dispositions. We provide constant currency\u201d and organic constant currency\u201d calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage.\nWhen we use the term constant currency,\u201d it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated.\nWhen we use the term organic constant currency,\u201d it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business.\nThe constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our\nindustry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nConstant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are included on pages 38 and 39.\nResults of Operations - For Years of Operation Ending December 31, 2018 and 2017\nDuring 2018, the United States dollar was weaker, on average, relative to the currencies in Europe, having a favorable impact on our reported results. While our reported revenues from services increased 4.5% from 2017, our reported operating profit increased 0.9%, and our net earnings per share - diluted increased 6.5%, these results were impacted by the relative strength of other currencies against the United States dollar compared to 2017, and generally may overstate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 2.0% favorable impact on revenues from services, a 1.3% favorable impact on operating profit, and an approximately $0.08 per share favorable impact on net earnings per share - diluted. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results.\nIn 2018, we experienced uneven results as we saw constant currency revenue declines in the United States, Northern Europe, and Right Management, while we saw constant-currency revenue growth in Other Americas, France, Italy, Other Southern Europe and APME. Our consolidated revenues were up 2.5% in constant currency in 2018 compared to 2017.\nWe experienced increasing demand in the first half of the year while demand softened to a nearly flat consolidated growth rate in the second half of the year, primarily driven by lower growth rates or declines in constant currency in most of our European markets, most notably France, Italy and Germany. Our 2018 results reflect a slower growth environment during the second half of the year in certain markets within Southern and Northern Europe, which when combined represented approximately 67% of our total consolidated revenues. We expect the European economic slowdown experienced in the second half of 2018 to continue into at least the first quarter of 2019. Beyond that, we cannot predict if the trend will continue, reverse or intensify. The constant currency revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to a decrease in Germany resulting from challenges with the implementation of new systems and actions taken to optimize our delivery channels that caused some client disruption, as well as softer demand from the manufacturing sector in that market. We experienced better performance from our Southern Europe segment than from our Northern Europe segment, as discussed below under \"Segment Results\" due to the revenue increases in Italy, France, and certain other markets within Southern Europe. France experienced uneven but declining economic conditions with certain economic indicators and business confidence measures reaching their lowest point during the second half of 2018.\nOur ManpowerGroup Solutions business had strong growth in 2018 in addition to a 6.9% constant currency increase (8.4% as reported) in our permanent recruitment business. At Right Management, we experienced a constant currency revenue decline for both our outplacement services, due to the counter-cyclical nature of this business, and our talent management services.\nOur gross profit margin in 2018 decreased compared to 2017 primarily due to the decline in our staffing/interim gross profit margin. The staffing/interim gross profit margin decline is due to the decrease in the CICE payroll tax credit rate in France and the loss of the December 2018 CICE subsidy as a result of the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019, and business mix changes in various countries. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018, primarily in France and Japan. The margin also declined due to the decreased demand in our outplacement business at Right Management. These declines were partially offset by the increase in our permanent recruitment business. The CICE payroll tax credit is accounted for as a reduction of our cost of services in the period, and has had a favorable impact on our consolidated gross margin, as well as margins in France and Southern Europe since 2013. The CICE program was replaced with new subsidies starting in January 2019 and we expect this replacement to have a\nnegative impact on our gross profit margin. The new subsidies and their anticipated impact is discussed in the section, \"Legal Regulations,\" found in Item 1. \"Business.\"\nOur operating profit decreased in 2018, down 0.4% in constant currency (0.9% increase as reported) with operating profit margin down 20 basis points compared to 2017. Included in 2018 and 2017 were $39.3 million and $34.5 million, respectively, of restructuring costs primarily related to the integration of certain acquisitions and front-office, back-office and delivery-model optimization. Excluding the restructuring costs in both 2018 and 2017, our operating profit was down 0.2% in constant currency with operating profit margin down 10 basis points compared to 2017. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the growth in the business and enhance our productivity and technology and digital capabilities.\nConsolidated Results - 2018 compared to 2017\nThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2018 as compared to 2017.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reported\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance in\nConstant\nCurrency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance in\nOrganic Constant\nCurrency\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,991.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,034.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services\n</td> <td>18,412.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,549.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>3,579.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,484.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>2,782.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,695.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses as a % of revenues\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>796.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>789.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit margin\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest expense\n</td> <td>41.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>754.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>737.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>198.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>26.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>556.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>545.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings per share - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares - diluted\n</td> <td>65.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 4.5% (2.5% in constant currency and 2.2% in organic constant currency) was attributed to:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased demand for services in several of our markets within Southern Europe and Northern Europe, where revenues increased 8.3% (4.0% in constant currency) and 1.2% (-2.0% in constant currency), respectively.

Interest and other expenses were $42.0 million in 2018 compared to $51.9 million in 2017. Net interest expense decreased $3.6 million in 2018 to $41.0 million from $44.6 million in 2017 due to the lower interest rate on our \u20ac500.0 million notes offered and sold in June 2018 compared to the interest rate on the \u20ac350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018 that were repaid in June 2018. Foreign exchange losses in 2018 were $1.4 million compared to $0.8 million in 2017. The increase in foreign exchange losses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the $2.5 million translation loss in Argentina as a result of the highly-inflationary designation of its economy as of July 1, 2018, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units and translation gains resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States in 2018. Miscellaneous income was $0.4 million in 2018 compared to miscellaneous expense of $6.5 million in 2017. The variance is primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a decrease in gains on the sale of investments by our minority-owned Swiss Franchise.\nWe recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 26.2% in 2018, as compared to an effective rate of 26.0% in 2017. The 26.2% effective tax rate for 2018 was higher than the United States federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the French business tax. In 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to increase to approximately 34% due primarily to the transition of the French CICE subsidy, which was non-taxable, to new subsidies in January 2019 that are taxable.\nNet earnings per share - diluted was $8.56 in 2018 compared to $8.04 in 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.08 in 2018. Restructuring costs recorded in 2018 and 2017 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.46 and $0.41 per share, net of tax, for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The gain from the sale of the Netherlands' language translation business favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.06 per share, net of tax, for 2018. The translation loss from the Argentina highly-inflationary designation recorded in 2018 negatively impacted net earnings per share- diluted by approximately $0.04 per share, net of tax, for 2018. The net tax benefits related to the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") and the French tax reform positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.09 per share in 2017.\nWeighted average shares - diluted decreased 4.1% to 65.1 million in 2018 from 67.9 million in 2017. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2018 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2017, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards in 2018.\nConsolidated Results - 2017 compared to 2016\nThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2017 as compared to 2016.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reported\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance in\nConstant\nCurrency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance in\nOrganic\nConstant\nCurrency\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,034.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,654.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services\n</td> <td>17,549.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,320.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>3,484.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,333.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>2,695.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,588.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses as a % of revenues\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>789.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>745.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit margin\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest expense\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense (income)\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>737.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>701.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>191.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>257.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>26.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>36.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>545.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings per share - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares - diluted\n</td> <td>67.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 7.0% (6.0% in constant currency and 5.5% in organic constant currency) was attributed to:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased demand for services in several of our markets within Southern Europe and Northern Europe, where in constant currency revenues increased 12.7% (15.5% as reported) and 3.4% (3.5% as reported; 2.6% in organic constant currency), respectively.

Interest and other expenses were $51.9 million in 2017 compared to $44.2 million in 2016. Net interest expense decreased $1.3 million in 2017 to $44.6 million from $45.9 million in 2016 due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher interest rates on investments. Foreign exchange losses in 2017 were $0.8 million compared to $2.8 million in 2016. The foreign exchange losses in 2017 were primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units, partially offset by translation gains resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States. The foreign exchange losses in 2016 were primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units, translation losses resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States, and a foreign currency loss as a result of the change in the exchange rate in our Venezuela reporting unit. Miscellaneous expense was $6.5 million in 2017 compared to miscellaneous income of $4.5 million in 2016. The variance between 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to a $6.9 million pension curtailment gain in 2016 and an increase in expenses related to net earnings\nattributable to noncontrolling interests in 2017 compared to 2016, partially offset by a gain on the sale of investments by our minority-owned Swiss Franchise recorded in 2017.\nWe recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 26.0% in 2017, as compared to an effective rate of 36.7% in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the $73.7 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2017 as a result of the tax benefit from the enactment of the Tax Act, offset by the tax expense from French tax reform. These enactments resulted in the net reduction of United States tax liabilities of $247.4 million offset by the United States transition tax expense of $170.2 million and a decrease in the French deferred tax assets of $3.5 million. Excluding the impact of these enactments, our rate would have been 36.0%. This is higher than the United States federal statutory rate of 35%, the rate in effect prior to the Tax Act, due primarily to the French business tax and other permanent items, offset by the favorable impact from the adoption of the new accounting guidance for share-based payments effective January 1, 2017, the favorable settlement of an audit and the net release of valuation allowances.\nNet earnings per share - diluted was $8.04 in 2017 compared to $6.27 in 2016. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.10 in 2017. The net tax benefits related to the Tax Act and the French tax reform positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.09 per share in 2017. Restructuring costs recorded in 2017 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.41 per share, net of tax. The tax benefit related to the favorable settlement of an audit and the adoption of new accounting guidance for share-based payments positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.13 and $0.09, respectively, in 2017. We adopted the new accounting guidance for share-based payments in January 2017 and it required all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from share-based compensation to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement rather than capital in excess of par value on a prospective basis.\nWeighted average shares - diluted decreased 4.2% to 67.9 million in 2017 from 70.8 million in 2016. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2017 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2016, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards in 2017.\nSegment Results\nWe evaluate performance based on operating unit profit ( OUP\u201d), which is equal to segment revenues less direct costs and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes.\nAmericas\nIn the Americas, revenues from services decreased 1.4% (increase of 1.3% in constant currency and 0.4% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 5.1% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by a decline in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector because of decreased demand from larger clients, a decline in our Manpower staffing services due to reduced demand from certain clients, and a 3.2% decrease in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 5.1% (12.4% in constant currency; 9.9% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. We experienced constant currency revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Brazil of 8.3%, 9.5%, 15.2%, 14.9%, 4.5%, and 14.0% (6.2%, 9.3%, -27.6%, 14.6%, 3.6%, and -0.1%, respectively, as reported). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. There has been a steady devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar in the last few years. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018.\nIn 2017, revenues from services decreased 1.9% (-1.7% in constant currency) compared to 2016. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 6.3% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services, mainly due to the reduced staffing volumes in the manufacturing sector of the economy, a decrease in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector because of decreased demand by several large clients, a decrease in ManpowerGroup Solutions business due to a specific client loss and roll off of certain project work, and an unfavorable impact from one fewer billing day. In Other\nAmericas, revenues from services increased 6.6% (7.1% in constant currency) in 2017 compared to 2016. We experienced revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Colombia and Peru of 11.1%, 4.4%, 4.9%, 6.9%, and 10.9%, respectively (12.0%, 2.3%, 17.5%, 3.7%, and 7.1%, respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in Brazil of 10.4% (-17.0 in constant currency) due to the non-recurrence of the business associated with the Rio Olympics in 2016.\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to business mix changes within our staffing/interim business, as revenue growth came from our lower-margin entities within Other Americas as well as a decline in the United States' staffing/interim margin due to the non-recurrence of certain prior year favorable reductions related to workers' compensation and health care costs in the United States. In 2017, gross profit margin increased compared to 2016 as a result of improved staffing/interim margin in the United States due to lower direct costs primarily related to workers' compensation and health care costs, partially offset by decreases in our staffing/interim margins within some of our markets in Other Americas because of business mix changes.\nIn 2018, selling and administrative expenses decreased 2.8% (-0.7% in constant currency; -1.4% in organic constant currency), due primarily to strong cost management and a decline in salary-related expenses as a result of lower headcount in the United States and a decrease in restructuring costs to $0.3 million in 2018 from $6.3 million in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by increased costs related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of an acquisition in Other Americas. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses decreased 4.1% (-3.8% in constant currency), due primarily to strong cost management and a decline in salary-related expenses as a result of lower headcount. These decreases were partially offset by $6.3 million of restructuring costs incurred in 2017 primarily related to severance costs incurred in connection with United States back-office optimization and an increase in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities.\nOUP margin in the Americas was 4.9%, 5.1% and 4.6% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin was 5.2%, 5.7% and 5.0% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The margin decrease in 2018 in the United States was primarily due to the increased costs as a result of investment in certain technology and back-office and delivery model optimization activities and the decline in the gross profit margin, partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs. Other Americas OUP margin was 4.5%, 3.9% and 3.7% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The margin increased in Other Americas in 2018 compared to 2017 due to improved operational leverage, as we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2018 and a decrease in the gross profit margin. The margin increase in the Americas in 2017 was primarily due to the United States as a result of the improvement in the gross profit margin and strong cost management, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nSouthern Europe\nIn 2018, revenues from services in Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, increased 8.3% (4.0% in constant currency) compared to 2017. In 2018, revenues from services increased 6.4% (1.9% in constant currency) in France (which represents 62% of Southern Europe's revenues) and increased 13.2% (8.3% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 18% of Southern Europe's revenues). The increase in France is primarily due to the strong growth in our large client accounts within the staffing market in the first half of the year and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 14.5% (9.1% in constant currency). The increase in Italy is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 15.9% increase (10.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 9.9% (6.8% in constant currency, 6.1% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the 9.0% increase (4.4% in constant currency; 2.5% in organic constant currency) in Spain, the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 21.9% (19.1% in constant currency) and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business.\nIn 2017, revenues from services in Southern Europe increased 15.5% (12.7% in constant currency) compared to 2016. In 2017, revenues from services increased 13.2% (10.6% in constant currency) in France and increased 26.4% (23.3% in constant currency) in Italy. The increase in France was primarily due to the strong growth in our\nlarge client accounts within the staffing market, growth in our Proservia business and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 10.5% (8.3% in constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. The increase in Italy was mostly due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and an increase of 26.0% (23.7% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of two fewer billing days. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 14.2% (10.8% in constant currency) in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, an increase of 15.1% (12.3% in constant currency; 5.2% in organic constant currency) in Spain primarily due to the increase in our Experis business, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 27.5% (23.9% in constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of two fewer billing days.\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decrease in Italy's Manpower staffing margin as a result of business mix changes and pricing pressures, while France's staffing/interim margin was flat as the decrease in the CICE payroll tax credit rate and the loss of the December 2018 CICE subsidy as a result of the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019 were offset by various initiatives as well as favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of 17.5% (13.1% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In 2017, gross profit margin decreased compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in France's staffing margin, as a result of business mix changes in a competitive pricing environment as we have experienced growth in our lower-margin large client accounts and pricing pressures, partially offset by the increase in the CICE subsidy effective January 1, 2017, and decreases in Italy's Manpower staffing margin primarily due to pricing pressures and business mix changes. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 19.9% (17.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business.\nIn 2018, selling and administrative expenses increased 9.4% (4.9% in constant currency; 4.8% in organic constant currency) compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount, restructuring costs of $5.4 million incurred in 2018, and an increase in non-personnel related costs to support the increase in revenues. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 8.9% (6.4% in constant currency; 5.7% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses as a result of higher headcount to support the increase in revenues, and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the acquisitions in Spain.\nOUP margin in Southern Europe was 5.0%, 5.1% and 5.1% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. France's OUP margin was 5.0%, 5.1% and 5.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. France's margin decrease in 2018 was primarily due an increase in expenses as we invest to support higher growth. Italy's OUP margin was 6.7%, 7.1% and 6.8% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Italy's margin decrease in 2018 was due to the decline in the gross profit margin and the restructuring costs incurred in 2018, partially offset by improved operational leverage, as we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses. Other Southern Europe's OUP margin was 3.5%, 3.5% and 3.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The margin in Southern Europe in 2017 was flat compared to 2016 as improved operational leverage on increased revenues was offset by the decrease in the gross profit margin.\nNorthern Europe\nIn Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 31%, 20%, 20%, 14% and 8%, respectively, of Northern Europe's revenues), revenues from services increased 1.2% (-2.0% in constant currency) in 2018 as compared to 2017. We experienced revenue growth in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 3.2%, 0.3%, 0.4% and 6.5%, respectively (-0.4%, 0.1%, -4.2%, and 2.0%, respectively, in constant currency) and a decline in Germany of 3.6% (-8.3% in constant currency). The Northern Europe constant currency revenue decrease is due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the decrease in Germany resulting from challenges with the implementation of new systems and actions taken to optimize our delivery channels that caused some client disruption, as well as softer demand from the manufacturing sector in that market. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Proservia business, a 6.6% increase (3.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, and increased demand for our Experis interim services, primarily within the IT sector in the United Kingdom.\nIn 2017, revenues from services increased 3.5% (3.4% in constant currency; 2.6% in organic constant currency) as compared to 2016. We experienced revenue growth in Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 12.5%, 7.6%, 15.2% and 6.8% , respectively (10.1%, 6.6%, 12.6%, and 4.5%, respectively, in constant currency; 5.1% and 8.4% in organic constant currency in the Nordics and the Netherlands) and a decline in the United Kingdom of 11.1% (-6.5% in constant currency). The Northern Europe revenue increase is due to growth in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, mostly within our Proservia business, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 4.6% increase (5.7% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. These increases were partially offset by reduced demand within our largest client accounts in the United Kingdom and the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day.\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes and lower associate utilization in Germany, partially offset by the increase in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and increase in our permanent recruitment business. In 2017, gross profit margin was flat compared to 2016 as the increase in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and increase in our permanent recruitment business was offset by the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes.\nSelling and administrative expenses increased 2.0% (-1.8% in constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to the increase in restructuring costs of $33.3 million in 2018 from $23.8 million in 2017. The 2018 restructuring costs related to delivery model and other front-office centralization activities as well as back-office optimization activities primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium. The 2017 restructuring costs were primarily related to severance costs incurred in connection with the further integration of 7S Group GmbH (\"7S\") in Germany, branch and back-office optimization in the United Kingdom and management and back-office optimization along with the integration of an Experis acquisition in the Netherlands. Excluding the restructuring costs, selling and administrative expenses decreased 2.7% in constant currency (increase of 0.8% as reported) primarily due to a $8.4 million gain from the sale of a non-core language translation business in the Netherlands and a decrease in salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction of headcount, partially offset by an increase in consulting costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 8.4% (8.3% in constant currency; 7.0% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016 due primarily to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017. Excluding the restructuring costs, selling and administrative expenses increased 4.9% (4.5% in constant currency; 3.3% in organic constant currency), primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses as a result of higher headcount in certain countries to support the increase in revenues, the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the acquisitions in the Nordics and the Netherlands and an increase in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities.\nOUP margin for Northern Europe was 2.3%, 2.6% and 3.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the gross profit margin, the increased costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities, and an increase in restructuring costs in 2018 compared to 2017. The OUP margin decreased in 2017 primarily due to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017 and the increase in consulting costs.\nAPME\nRevenues from services increased 9.6% (9.4% in constant currency; 8.7% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. In Japan (which represents 31% of APME's revenues), revenues from services increased 4.7% (3.1% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 16.1% increase (14.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia (which represents 20% of APME's revenues), revenue from services increased 2.4% (5.1% in constant currency) due to the increase in our Manpower staffing business and a 4.6% increase (6.9% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, mostly in India, Greater China, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia and an increase in our permanent recruitment businesses.\nIn 2017, revenues from services for APME increased 6.7% (6.4% in constant currency; 6.1% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016. In Japan, revenues from services increased 1.0% (4.4% in constant currency) due to\nthe increase in our staffing/interim business and a 10.7% increase (14.5% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia, revenue from services decreased 1.0% in constant currency (increase of 2.1% as reported) due to the decrease in demand for our Manpower staffing services in constant currency as we saw a slowing of new business and the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day, partially offset by a 7.2% increase in constant currency (10.7% as reported) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, mostly in Greater China, India, Singapore and Thailand, and growth in our ManpowerGroup Solutions and permanent recruitment businesses.\nGross profit margin increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the improvement in our staffing/interim margin as a result of favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018 in Japan, increase in our permanent recruitment business of 9.9% (10.2% in constant currency), and a margin increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. In 2017, gross profit margin increased compared to 2016 due to an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 12.1% (10.8% in constant currency) and growth in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business, partially offset by a decrease in our staffing/interim margins as a result of direct cost increases in certain markets and changes in business mix.\nSelling and administrative expenses increased 8.4% (8.2% in constant currency; 6.9% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase is due to the increase in salary-related costs because of higher headcount to support the increase in revenues and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of an acquisition, partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in 2018 from $1.4 million incurred in 2017 in Australia related to branch and back-office optimization. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 6.0% (5.9% in constant currency; 5.5% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs because of higher headcount to support the increases in revenues and due to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nOUP margin for APME was 4.0%, 3.8% and 3.6% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The OUP margin increased in 2018 due to improved operating leverage on increased revenues and the improvement in the gross profit margin. The OUP margin increase in 2017 was due to the increase in our gross profit margin and better operational leverage, because we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nRight Management\nIn 2018, revenues from services for Right Management decreased 8.5% (-9.4% in constant currency). The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of 10.3% (-11.3% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as we experienced reduced demand in most of our markets due to the counter-cyclical nature of this business. Our talent management business decreased 2.9% (-3.3% in constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decline in our Americas markets.\nIn 2017, revenues from services decreased 15.8% (-15.6% in constant currency). The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of 15.3% (-14.9% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as we experienced softer demand in many of our markets due to the counter-cyclical nature of this business and the non-recurrence of certain client activity within the United States. Our talent management business decreased 17.6% (-18.0% in constant currency) in 2017 compared to 2016 mostly due to softening demand in our Asian markets.\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the decreases in both our outplacement and talent management business gross profit margins and the change in business mix as the higher-margin outplacement business represented a lower percentage of the revenues mix. In 2017, gross profit margin decreased due to decreases in both our outplacement and talent management business gross profit margins.\nIn 2018, selling and administrative expenses decreased 9.7% (-10.6% in constant currency) compared to 2017 primarily due to reduced compensation-related expenses, such as salaries and variable-incentive costs, due to lower headcount, and the decrease in restructuring costs incurred in 2018 compared to 2017. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses decreased 15.4% (-15.1% in constant currency) compared to 2016 due to reduced compensation-related expenses such as salaries and variable-incentive costs due to lower headcount and a decrease in office-related costs related to a decrease in the number of offices. These items were partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nOUP margin for Right Management was 16.4%, 16.5% and 17.3% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The OUP margin for 2018 decreased due to the decline in our gross profit margin, partially offset by improved operational leverage and the decrease of restructuring costs incurred in 2018 compared to 2017. The OUP margin for 2017 decreased due to the decline in our gross profit margin and the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nFinancial Measures\nConstant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation\nCertain constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances are discussed throughout this report.

We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $331.2 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, we have no longer recorded United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. As of December 31, 2018, deferred taxes related to non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $1,729.3 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $15.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. We have an additional $292.5 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries for which we have not currently provided deferred taxes.\nOur principal ongoing cash needs are to finance working capital, capital expenditures, debt payments, interest expense, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. Working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables, which generally increase as revenues increase. The amount of financing necessary to support revenue growth depends on receivables turnover, which differs in each market where we operate.\nCash provided by operating activities was $483.1 , $400.9 and $600.0 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $198.3 million of cash in 2018, as compared to $78.9 million and $49.7 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in 2018 from 2017 was primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments and the contingent consideration of $24.1 million paid in 2018 in excess of the contingent consideration liabilities initially recognized on the acquisition date. The change in 2017 from 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to the growth in the business and changes in business mix, partially offset by the timing of collections and payments.\nThe CICE payroll tax credit is creditable against our current French income tax payable, with any remaining amount being paid after three years. In April 2018, March 2017 and March 2016, we sold substantially all of our CICE earned in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for net proceeds of $234.5 million (\u20ac190.9 million), $143.5 million (\u20ac133.0 million) and $143.1 million (\u20ac129.9 million), respectively. We derecognized these receivables upon the sale as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded as a reduction of the payroll tax credits earned in the respective years in cost of services.\nAccounts receivable decreased to $5,276.1 million as of December 31, 2018 from $5,370.5 million as of December 31, 2017. This decrease is due to changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher Days Sales Outstanding (\"DSO\"). DSO increased by approximately two days from December 31, 2017, due primarily to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO.\nCapital expenditures were $64.7 million, $54.7 million and $56.9 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs of $5.6 million in 2018, $1.7 million in 2017 and $0.9 million in 2016.\nFrom time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $51.8 million, $45.7 million and $60.5 million, respectively. The 2018 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $9.1 million and contingent consideration payments of $42.7 million ($18.6 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date). The 2017 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $32.7 million and contingent consideration related to previous acquisitions of $13.0 million, of which $10.3 million was related to our 2015 acquisition of 7S in Germany. The 2016 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $57.6 million and contingent consideration payments of $2.9 million.\nOccasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations to optimize our global strategic positioning and synergies. In December 2018, we sold one of our business units in the Netherlands for net cash proceeds of $13.2 million and divested a majority interest in a consolidated entity in China with an immaterial cash impact.\nAs of December 31, 2018, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2018 acquisitions were $6.1 and $0.7, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2017 acquisitions were $35.0 and $13.3, respectively, the majority of which took place in India and Hong Kong.\nCash provided by net debt borrowings was $178.2 million and $5.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, compared to net debt repayments of $6.7 million in 2016. In June 2018, we offered and sold \u20ac500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026, with the net proceeds of \u20ac495.7 million predominantly used to repay our \u20ac350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018. (See the \"Euro Notes\" section below for further information.)\nThe Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock in each of August 2018, July 2016 and October 2015. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. In 2018, we repurchased a total of 5.7 million shares, comprised of 2.9 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.8 million shares under the 2016 authorization, at a total cost of $500.7 million. In 2017, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $203.9 million under the 2016 authorization. In 2016, we repurchased a total of 6.6 million shares, comprised of 1.3 million shares under the 2016 authorization and 5.3 million shares under the 2015 authorization, at a total cost of $482.2 million. As of December 31, 2018, there were 3.1 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization and no shares remaining under the 2016 and 2015 authorizations.\nWe have aggregate commitments of $2,202.2 million related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments, as follows:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt including interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,140.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$18.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$37.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$486.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$597.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>49.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>566.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severances and other office closure costs\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transition tax resulting from the Tax Act\n</td> <td>128.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>301.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,202.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$347.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$380.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$667.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$807.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, of $34.2 million is excluded from the commitments above as we cannot determine the years in which these positions might ultimately be settled.\nWe recorded net restructuring costs of $39.3 million and $34.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries. During 2018 and 2017, we made payments of $37.3 million and $25.5 million, respectively, out of our restructuring reserve. We expect a majority of the remaining $15.5 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2019.\nWe have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total approximately $190.3 million and $201.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively ($139.0 million and $149.3 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.3 million and $52.6 million for stand-by letters of credit, respectively). Guarantees primarily relate to bank accounts, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit relate to workers' compensation, operating leases and indebtedness. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.9 million for both 2018 and 2017.\nTotal capitalization as of December 31, 2018 was $3,773.9 million, comprised of $1,075.4 million in debt and $2,698.5 million in equity. Debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 28% as of December 31, 2018 and 25% as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nEuro Notes\nOn June 22, 2018, we offered and sold \u20ac500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026 (the \u20ac500.0 million notes\u201d). The net proceeds from the \u20ac500.0 million notes of \u20ac495.7 million were used to repay our \u20ac350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The \u20ac500.0 million notes were issued at a price of 99.564% to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809%. Interest on the \u20ac500.0 million notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The \u20ac500.0 million notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities.\nOur \u20ac400.0 million aggregate principal amount 1.875% notes (the \"\u20ac400.0 million notes\") are due September 2022. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the \u20ac500.0 million notes or the \u20ac400.0 million notes.\nBoth the \u20ac500.0 million notes and \u20ac400.0 million notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. A portion of these notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2018. For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, both net of taxes, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See the Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations section and Notes 8 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further information.)\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nOn June 18, 2018, we amended and restated our Five Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks, principally to revise the termination date of the facility from September 16, 2020 to June 18, 2023. The remaining material terms and conditions of the Agreement are substantially similar to the previous agreement. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $600.0 million in various currencies, and up to $150.0 million may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. We had no borrowings under this facility as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $0.5 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million and $599.2 million were available to us under the facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 12.5 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 100.0 basis points on any borrowings. A downgrade from both credit agencies would unfavorably impact our facility fees and result in additional costs ranging from approximately $0.2 million to $0.8 million annually.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (\"EBITDA\")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgments, change of control and customary ERISA defaults.\nAs defined in the Credit Agreement, we had a net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.97 to 1 (compared to the maximum allowable ratio of 3.5 to 1) and a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 5.35 to 1 (compared to the minimum required ratio of 1.5 to 1) as of December 31, 2018.\nOther\nIn addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2018, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $319.9 million, of which $269.1 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $249.2 million could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2018.\nOur long-term debt has a rating of Baa1 from Moody's Investor Services and BBB from Standard and Poor's, both with a stable outlook. Both of the credit ratings are investment grade. Rating agencies use proprietary methodology in determining their ratings and outlook which includes, among other things, financial ratios based upon debt levels and earnings performance.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nEmployment-Related Items\nThe employment of contingent workers and permanent staff throughout the world results in the recognition of liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans, social program remittances and payroll tax audit exposures that require us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the proper reserve levels. These reserves involve significant estimates or judgments that are material to our financial statements.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees. The most significant plans are located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and France. Annual expense relating to these plans was $13.9 million, $11.2 million and $3.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is estimated to be approximately $15.1 million in 2019. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost (\"net benefit cost\"). The new guidance requires bifurcation of net benefit cost, which used to be reported as an employee cost within operating income under the old guidance. The service cost component is still presented with other employee compensation cost in operating income or capitalized in assets in rare circumstances. The other components are now reported separately outside of operations, and are not eligible for capitalization. We have reclassified the prior year non-service cost components of net benefit cost to interest and other expenses from selling and administrative expenses to conform to the current period presentation. The non-service cost components related to our defined benefit pension plans were a net cost of $3.0 million and $1.1 million and a net credit of $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further information.)\nThe calculations of annual pension expense and the pension liability required at year-end include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, compensation increases and employee turnover rates. We review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions as necessary. We review market data and historical rates, on a country-by-country basis, to check for reasonableness in setting both the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected returns of the various investment asset classes held in the plans. We estimate compensation increases and employee turnover rates for each plan based on the historical rates and the expected future rates for each respective country. Changes to any of these assumptions will impact the level of annual expense recorded related to the plans.\nIn determining the estimated 2019 pension expense for non-United States plans, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 2.4% compared to 2.1% for 2018, reflecting the current interest rate environment. We have selected a weighted-average expected return on plan assets of 2.4% for the non-United States plans in determining the 2019 estimated pension expense compared to 2.7% used for the calculation of the 2018 pension expense. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase and decrease in the weighted-average discount rate would impact our 2019 consolidated pension expense by a decrease of approximately $0.5 million and an increase of approximately $0.3 million, respectively. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the weighted-average expected return on plan assets would correspondingly decrease or increase our 2019 consolidated pension expense by approximately $0.9 million. Changes to these assumptions have historically not been significant in any jurisdiction for any reporting period, and no significant adjustments to the amounts recorded have been required in the past or are expected in the future. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further information.)\nSocial Program Remittances and Payroll Tax Audit Exposure\nOn a routine basis, various governmental agencies in some of the countries and territories in which we operate audit our payroll tax calculations and our compliance with other payroll-related regulations. These audits focus primarily on documentation requirements and our support for our payroll tax remittances. Due to the nature of our business, the number of people that we employ, and the complexity of some payroll tax regulations, we may have some adjustments to the payroll tax remittances as a result of these audits.\nWe make an estimate of the additional remittances that may be required on a country-by-country basis, and record the estimate as a component of cost of services or selling and administrative expenses, as appropriate. Each country's estimate is based on the results of past audits and the number of years that have not yet been audited, with consideration for changing business volumes and changes to the payroll tax regulations. To the extent that our actual experience differs from our estimates, we will need to make adjustments to our reserve balance, which will impact the results of the related operation and the operating segment in which it is reported. Other than France, we have not had any significant adjustments to the amounts recorded as a result of any payroll tax audits, and we do not expect any significant adjustments to the recorded amounts in the near term.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which utilization of the asset is not likely.\nThe accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions requires an evaluation process for all tax positions taken that involves a review of probability for sustaining a tax position. If the probability for sustaining a tax position is more likely than not, which is a 50% threshold, then the tax position is warranted and the largest amount, based on cumulative probability, that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement is recognized. An uncertain tax position, one which does not meet the 50% threshold, will not be recognized in the financial statements.\nOur judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded. Our net deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted in the event that tax rates are modified, or our estimates of future taxable income change, such that deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled at a different tax rate than currently estimated. In addition, valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the event that our estimates of future taxable income change. We have unrecognized tax benefits related to items in various countries and territories. To the extent these items are settled for an amount different than we currently expect, the unrecognized tax benefit will be adjusted.\nWe provide for income taxes on a quarterly basis based on an estimated annual tax rate. In determining this rate, we make estimates about taxable income for each of our largest locations worldwide, as well as the tax rate that\nwill be in effect for each location. To the extent these estimates change during the year, or actual results differ from these estimates, our estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act made broad changes to the United States tax code, including a reduction of the United States federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and a transition to a Territorial Tax regime resulting in a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of unremitted post-1986 non-United States earnings. The Tax Act also established new provisions related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\"), Foreign-Derived Intangible Income ( FDII\u201d) and a Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax ( BEAT\u201d). The computation of these new provisions is highly complex, and our estimates could significantly change as a result of new rules or guidance from the various standard-setting bodies.\nDuring 2018, the Internal Revenue Service issued new guidance affecting the computation of our 2017 transition tax liability. As a result of the new guidance and additional analysis of the impacts of the Tax Act, we revised our provisional estimates recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 and as a result, recorded a tax expense of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nSee Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the impacts of the Tax Act. Such note is found in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value.\nWe performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2018, 2017 and 2016, and there was no impairment of our goodwill as a result of our annual tests.\nSignificant assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2018 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates ranging from 10.6% to 14.2%, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance.\nThe table below provides our reporting units' estimated fair values and carrying values, determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter, representing approximately 77% of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2018.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>France\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Germany\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Right Management\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Netherlands\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair values\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,513.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,307.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$446.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$431.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$354.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$227.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carrying values\n</td> <td>1,186.7\n</td> <td>808.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>363.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "Our principal ongoing cash needs are to finance working capital, capital expenditures, debt payments, interest expense, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. Working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables, which generally increase as revenues increase. The amount of financing necessary to support revenue growth depends on receivables turnover, which differs in each market where we operate.\nThe calculations of annual pension expense and the pension liability required at year-end include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, compensation increases and employee turnover rates. We review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions as necessary. We review market data and historical rates, on a country-by-country basis, to check for reasonableness in setting both the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected returns of the various investment asset classes held in the plans. We estimate compensation increases and employee turnover rates for each plan based on the historical rates and the expected future rates for each respective country. Changes to any of these assumptions will impact the level of annual expense recorded related to the plans.\n \u2022 a 0.8% increase in constant currency (1.5% as reported) in organic salary-related costs, primarily because of additional headcount to support the increased demand for our services specifically in Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME; \nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt including interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,140.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$18.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$37.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$486.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$597.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>49.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>566.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severances and other office closure costs\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transition tax resulting from the Tax Act\n</td> <td>128.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>301.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,202.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$347.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$380.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$667.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$807.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, revenues from services in Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, increased 8.3% (4.0% in constant currency) compared to 2017. In 2018, revenues from services increased 6.4% (1.9% in constant currency) in France (which represents 62% of Southern Europe's revenues) and increased 13.2% (8.3% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 18% of Southern Europe's revenues). The increase in France is primarily due to the strong growth in our large client accounts within the staffing market in the first half of the year and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 14.5% (9.1% in constant currency). The increase in Italy is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 15.9% increase (10.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 9.9% (6.8% in constant currency, 6.1% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the 9.0% increase (4.4% in constant currency; 2.5% in organic constant currency) in Spain, the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 21.9% (19.1% in constant currency) and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business.\nEuro Notes\nUnder the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 12.5 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 100.0 basis points on any borrowings. A downgrade from both credit agencies would unfavorably impact our facility fees and result in additional costs ranging from approximately $0.2 million to $0.8 million annually.\n \u2022 a revenue increase in APME of 9.6% (9.4% in constant currency and 8.7% in organic constant currency) primarily due to an increase in our staffing/interim revenues and a 9.9% increase (10.2% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business; \nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\nAmounts represent 2018\nPercentages represent 2018 compared to 2017\n</td> <td>Reported\nAmount\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reported\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact of\nCurrency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance in\nConstant\nCurrency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact of\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\n(in Constant\nCurrency)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic\nConstant\nCurrency\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,522.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Americas\n</td> <td>1,637.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>4,159.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southern Europe:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>France\n</td> <td>5,827.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Italy\n</td> <td>1,670.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Southern Europe\n</td> <td>1,873.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>9,371.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Northern Europe\n</td> <td>5,370.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>APME\n</td> <td>2,890.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Right Management\n</td> <td>199.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ManpowerGroup\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,991.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit -

The most significant plans are located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and France. Annual expense relating to these plans was $13.9 million, $11.2 million and $3.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is estimated to be approximately $15.1 million in 2019. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost (\"net benefit cost\"). The new guidance requires bifurcation of net benefit cost, which used to be reported as an employee cost within operating income under the old guidance. The service cost component is still presented with other employee compensation cost in operating income or capitalized in assets in rare circumstances. The other components are now reported separately outside of operations, and are not eligible for capitalization. We have reclassified the prior year non-service cost components of net benefit cost to interest and other expenses from selling and administrative expenses to conform to the current period presentation. The non-service cost components related to our defined benefit pension plans were a net cost of $3.0 million and $1.1 million and a net credit of $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

In 2017, selling and administrative expenses decreased 15.4% (-15.1% in constant currency) compared to 2016 due to reduced compensation-related expenses such as salaries and variable-incentive costs due to lower headcount and a decrease in office-related costs related to a decrease in the number of offices. These items were partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nIn 2018, revenues from services for Right Management decreased 8.5% (-9.4% in constant currency). The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of 10.3% (-11.3% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as we experienced reduced demand in most of our markets due to the counter-cyclical nature of this business. Our talent management business decreased 2.9% (-3.3% in constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decline in our Americas markets.\nWe have aggregate commitments of $2,202.2 million related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments, as follows:\nOn June 22, 2018, we offered and sold \u20ac500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026 (the \u20ac500.0 million notes\u201d). The net proceeds from the \u20ac500.0 million notes of \u20ac495.7 million were used to repay our \u20ac350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The \u20ac500.0 million notes were issued at a price of 99.564% to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809%. Interest on the \u20ac500.0 million notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The \u20ac500.0 million notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities.\nWe make an estimate of the additional remittances that may be required on a country-by-country basis, and record the estimate as a component of cost of services or selling and administrative expenses, as appropriate. Each country's estimate is based on the results of past audits and the number of years that have not yet been audited, with consideration for changing business volumes and changes to the payroll tax regulations. To the extent that our actual experience differs from our estimates, we will need to make adjustments to our reserve balance, which will impact the results of the related operation and the operating segment in which it is reported. Other than France, we have not had any significant adjustments to the amounts recorded as a result of any payroll tax audits, and we do not expect any significant adjustments to the recorded amounts in the near term.\nResults of Operations - For Years of Operation Ending December 31, 2018 and 2017\nWe provide for income taxes on a quarterly basis based on an estimated annual tax rate. In determining this rate, we make estimates about taxable income for each of our largest locations worldwide, as well as the tax rate that\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nConsolidated Results - 2018 compared to 2017\n \u2022 a revenue increase in APME of 6.4% in constant currency (6.7% as reported; 6.1% in organic constant currency) primarily due to an increase in our staffing/interim revenues, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and a 10.8% constant currency increase (12.1% as reported) in our permanent recruitment business; and \nIn determining the estimated 2019 pension expense for non-United States plans, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 2.4% compared to 2.1% for 2018, reflecting the current interest rate environment. We have selected a weighted-average expected return on plan assets of 2.4% for the non-United States plans in determining the 2019 estimated pension expense compared to 2.7% used for the calculation of the 2018 pension expense. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase and decrease in the weighted-average discount rate would impact our 2019 consolidated pension expense by a decrease of approximately $0.5 million and an increase of approximately $0.3 million, respectively. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the weighted-average expected return on plan assets would correspondingly decrease or increase our 2019 consolidated pension expense by approximately $0.9 million. Changes to these assumptions have historically not been significant in any jurisdiction for any reporting period, and no significant adjustments to the amounts recorded have been required in the past or are expected in the future. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further information.)\nTotal capitalization as of December 31, 2018 was $3,773.9 million, comprised of $1,075.4 million in debt and $2,698.5 million in equity. Debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 28% as of December 31, 2018 and 25% as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n \u2022 a 10 basis point (0.10%) favorable impact from the 8.4% (6.9% in constant currency) increase in our permanent recruitment business. \nOUP margin in the Americas was 4.9%, 5.1% and 4.6% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin was 5.2%, 5.7% and 5.0% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The margin decrease in 2018 in the United States was primarily due to the increased costs as a result of investment in certain technology and back-office and delivery model optimization activities and the decline in the gross profit margin, partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs. Other Americas OUP margin was 4.5%, 3.9% and 3.7% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The margin increased in Other Americas in 2018 compared to 2017 due to improved operational leverage, as we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2018 and a decrease in the gross profit margin. The margin increase in the Americas in 2017 was primarily due to the United States as a result of the improvement in the gross profit margin and strong cost management, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nSelling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 10 basis points (-0.10%) in 2018 compared to 2017. The change in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues consisted of:\nSignificant assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2018 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates ranging from 10.6% to 14.2%, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance.\n \u2022 a revenue decrease in the United States of 6.3% primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services, mainly due to the prolonged weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy, a decrease in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector due to decreased demand at several large clients, and a decrease in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, due to a specific client loss and roll off of certain project work; \nNet earnings per share - diluted was $8.04 in 2017 compared to $6.27 in 2016. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.10 in 2017. The net tax benefits related to the Tax Act and the French tax reform positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.09 per share in 2017. Restructuring costs recorded in 2017 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.41 per share, net of tax. The tax benefit related to the favorable settlement of an audit and the adoption of new accounting guidance for share-based payments positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.13 and $0.09, respectively, in 2017. We adopted the new accounting guidance for share-based payments in January 2017 and it required all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from share-based compensation to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement rather than capital in excess of par value on a prospective basis.\nOn June 18, 2018, we amended and restated our Five Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks, principally to revise the termination date of the facility from September 16, 2020 to June 18, 2023. The remaining material terms and conditions of the Agreement are substantially similar to the previous agreement. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $600.0 million in various currencies, and up to $150.0 million may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. We had no borrowings under this facility as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $0.5 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million and $599.2 million were available to us under the facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIn addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2018, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $319.9 million, of which $269.1 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $249.2 million could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2018.\nOccasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations to optimize our global strategic positioning and synergies. In December 2018, we sold one of our business units in the Netherlands for net cash proceeds of $13.2 million and divested a majority interest in a consolidated entity in China with an immaterial cash impact.\nWhen we use the term constant currency,\u201d it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated.\nRevenues from services increased 9.6% (9.4% in constant currency; 8.7% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. In Japan (which represents 31% of APME's revenues), revenues from services increased 4.7% (3.1% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 16.1% increase (14.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia (which represents 20% of APME's revenues), revenue from services increased 2.4% (5.1% in constant currency) due to the increase in our Manpower staffing business and a 4.6% increase (6.9% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, mostly in India, Greater China, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia and an increase in our permanent recruitment businesses.\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes and lower associate utilization in Germany, partially offset by the increase in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and increase in our permanent recruitment business. In 2017, gross profit margin was flat compared to 2016 as the increase in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and increase in our permanent recruitment business was offset by the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes.\n \u2022 decreased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues decreased 8.5% (-9.4% in constant currency), including a 10.3% decrease (-11.3% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as well as a 2.9% decrease (-3.3% in constant currency) in our talent management business. \nChanges in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and dispositions. We provide constant currency\u201d and organic constant currency\u201d calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage.\n \u2022 increased demand for services in several of our markets within Southern Europe and Northern Europe, where revenues increased 8.3% (4.0% in constant currency) and 1.2% (-2.0% in constant currency), respectively. This included a revenue increase in France of 6.4% (1.9% in constant currency), primarily due to strong growth in our large client accounts within the staffing market and a 14.5% increase (9.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. The Southern Europe increase also included an increase in Italy of 13.2% (8.3% in constant currency) due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 15.9% increase (10.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. We also experienced revenue growth in the Nordics, Spain and Belgium of 0.3%, 9.0% and 6.5%, respectively (0.1%, 4.4%, and 2.0%, respectively, in constant currency; 2.5%, in organic constant currency in Spain). Lastly, we experienced revenue growth in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands of 3.2% and 0.4%, respectively, while revenues decreased 0.4% and 4.2%, respectively, in constant currency; \nIn 2018, selling and administrative expenses decreased 2.8% (-0.7% in constant currency; -1.4% in organic constant currency), due primarily to strong cost management and a decline in salary-related expenses as a result of lower headcount in the United States and a decrease in restructuring costs to $0.3 million in 2018 from $6.3 million in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by increased costs related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of an acquisition in Other Americas. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses decreased 4.1% (-3.8% in constant currency), due primarily to strong cost management and a decline in salary-related expenses as a result of lower headcount. These decreases were partially offset by $6.3 million of restructuring costs incurred in 2017 primarily related to severance costs incurred in connection with United States back-office optimization and an increase in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities.\nOur judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded. Our net deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted in the event that tax rates are modified, or our estimates of future taxable income change, such that deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled at a different tax rate than currently estimated. In addition, valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the event that our estimates of future taxable income change. We have unrecognized tax benefits related to items in various countries and territories. To the extent these items are settled for an amount different than we currently expect, the unrecognized tax benefit will be adjusted.\nThe accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions requires an evaluation process for all tax positions taken that involves a review of probability for sustaining a tax position. If the probability for sustaining a tax position is more likely than not, which is a 50% threshold, then the tax position is warranted and the largest amount, based on cumulative probability, that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement is recognized. An uncertain tax position, one which does not meet the 50% threshold, will not be recognized in the financial statements.\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to business mix changes within our staffing/interim business, as revenue growth came from our lower-margin entities within Other Americas as well as a decline in the United States' staffing/interim margin due to the non-recurrence of certain prior year favorable reductions related to workers' compensation and health care costs in the United States. In 2017, gross profit margin increased compared to 2016 as a result of improved staffing/interim margin in the United States due to lower direct costs primarily related to workers' compensation and health care costs, partially offset by decreases in our staffing/interim margins within some of our markets in Other Americas because of business mix changes.\n \u2022 a 15.5% increase (13.3% in constant currency and 13.1% in organic constant currency) in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects, delivery model and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities; \nOn a routine basis, various governmental agencies in some of the countries and territories in which we operate audit our payroll tax calculations and our compliance with other payroll-related regulations. These audits focus primarily on documentation requirements and our support for our payroll tax remittances. Due to the nature of our business, the number of people that we employ, and the complexity of some payroll tax regulations, we may have some adjustments to the payroll tax remittances as a result of these audits.\nSelling and administrative expenses increased 2.0% (-1.8% in constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to the increase in restructuring costs of $33.3 million in 2018 from $23.8 million in 2017. The 2018 restructuring costs related to delivery model and other front-office centralization activities as well as back-office optimization activities primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium. The 2017 restructuring costs were primarily related to severance costs incurred in connection with the further integration of 7S Group GmbH (\"7S\") in Germany, branch and back-office optimization in the United Kingdom and management and back-office optimization along with the integration of an Experis acquisition in the Netherlands. Excluding the restructuring costs, selling and administrative expenses decreased 2.7% in constant currency (increase of 0.8% as reported) primarily due to a $8.4 million gain from the sale of a non-core language translation business in the Netherlands and a decrease in salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction of headcount, partially offset by an increase in consulting costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 8.4% (8.3% in constant currency; 7.0% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016 due primarily to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017. Excluding the restructuring costs, selling and administrative expenses increased 4.9% (4.5% in constant currency; 3.3% in organic constant currency), primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses as a result of higher headcount in certain countries to support the increase in revenues, the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the acquisitions in the Nordics and the Netherlands and an increase in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities.\n \u2022 decreased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues decreased 15.6% in constant currency (-15.8% as reported), including a 14.9% constant currency decrease (-15.3% as reported) in our outplacement services as well as an 18.0% constant currency decline (-17.6% as reported) in our talent management business; \nOur long-term debt has a rating of Baa1 from Moody's Investor Services and BBB from Standard and Poor's, both with a stable outlook. Both of the credit ratings are investment grade. Rating agencies use proprietary methodology in determining their ratings and outlook which includes, among other things, financial ratios based upon debt levels and earnings performance.\n\n \u2022 a revenue decrease in the United States of 5.1% primarily driven by a decline in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector because of decreased demand from larger clients, a decline in our Manpower staffing services due to reduced demand from certain clients, and a 3.2% decrease in the permanent recruitment business; and \nattributable to noncontrolling interests in 2017 compared to 2016, partially offset by a gain on the sale of investments by our minority-owned Swiss Franchise recorded in 2017.\nFrom time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $51.8 million, $45.7 million and $60.5 million, respectively. The 2018 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $9.1 million and contingent consideration payments of $42.7 million ($18.6 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date). The 2017 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $32.7 million and contingent consideration related to previous acquisitions of $13.0 million, of which $10.3 million was related to our 2015 acquisition of 7S in Germany. The 2016 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $57.6 million and contingent consideration payments of $2.9 million.\nWhen we use the term organic constant currency,\u201d it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business.\n\n \u2022 our acquisitions in the Americas, Southern Europe, and APME, which added approximately 0.3% revenue growth to our consolidated results; \nGross profit margin increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the improvement in our staffing/interim margin as a result of favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018 in Japan, increase in our permanent recruitment business of 9.9% (10.2% in constant currency), and a margin increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. In 2017, gross profit margin increased compared to 2016 due to an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 12.1% (10.8% in constant currency) and growth in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business, partially offset by a decrease in our staffing/interim margins as a result of direct cost increases in certain markets and changes in business mix.\nWeighted average shares - diluted decreased 4.2% to 67.9 million in 2017 from 70.8 million in 2016. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2017 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2016, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards in 2017.\nCapital expenditures were $64.7 million, $54.7 million and $56.9 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs of $5.6 million in 2018, $1.7 million in 2017 and $0.9 million in 2016.\n \u2022 a 10 basis point (-0.10%) unfavorable impact from decreased demand in our outplacement business at Right Management; partially offset by \nAs defined in the Credit Agreement, we had a net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.97 to 1 (compared to the maximum allowable ratio of 3.5 to 1) and a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 5.35 to 1 (compared to the minimum required ratio of 1.5 to 1) as of December 31, 2018.\nSelling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 40 basis points (-0.40%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The change in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues consisted of:\nThe year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 4.5% (2.5% in constant currency and 2.2% in organic constant currency) was attributed to:\nThe 4.1% increase in selling and administrative expenses in 2017 (3.5% in constant currency; 2.9% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to:\nIn the Americas, revenues from services decreased 1.4% (increase of 1.3% in constant currency and 0.4% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 5.1% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by a decline in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector because of decreased demand from larger clients, a decline in our Manpower staffing services due to reduced demand from certain clients, and a 3.2% decrease in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 5.1% (12.4% in constant currency; 9.9% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. We experienced constant currency revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Brazil of 8.3%, 9.5%, 15.2%, 14.9%, 4.5%, and 14.0% (6.2%, 9.3%, -27.6%, 14.6%, 3.6%, and -0.1%, respectively, as reported). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. There has been a steady devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar in the last few years. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 a 30 basis point (-0.30%) unfavorable impact from the decline in our staffing/interim margin due to the decrease in the CICE payroll tax credit rate in France and the loss of the December 2018 CICE subsidy as a result of the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019 and business mix changes in various countries, partially offset by favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018, primarily in France and Japan.; and \nIn 2017, revenues from services increased 3.5% (3.4% in constant currency; 2.6% in organic constant currency) as compared to 2016. We experienced revenue growth in Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 12.5%, 7.6%, 15.2% and 6.8%, respectively (10.1%, 6.6%, 12.6%, and 4.5%, respectively, in constant currency; 5.1% and 8.4% in organic constant currency in the Nordics and the Netherlands) and a decline in the United Kingdom of 11.1% (-6.5% in constant currency). The Northern Europe revenue increase is due to growth in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, mostly within our Proservia business, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 4.6% increase (5.7% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. These increases were partially offset by reduced demand within our largest client accounts in the United Kingdom and the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day.\nThe constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our\nCash Sources and Uses\nSegment Results\n \u2022 a 3.1% decrease (-4.9% in constant currency and -5.2% in organic constant currency) in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in certain markets. \nthe increase in our staffing/interim business and a 10.7% increase (14.5% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia, revenue from services decreased 1.0% in constant currency (increase of 2.1% as reported) due to the decrease in demand for our Manpower staffing services in constant currency as we saw a slowing of new business and the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day, partially offset by a 7.2% increase in constant currency (10.7% as reported) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, mostly in Greater China, India, Singapore and Thailand, and growth in our ManpowerGroup Solutions and permanent recruitment businesses.\nOUP margin for Northern Europe was 2.3%, 2.6% and 3.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the gross profit margin, the increased costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities, and an increase in restructuring costs in 2018 compared to 2017. The OUP margin decreased in 2017 primarily due to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017 and the increase in consulting costs.\n \u2022 increased demand for services in several of our markets within Southern Europe and Northern Europe, where in constant currency revenues increased 12.7% (15.5% as reported) and 3.4% (3.5% as reported; 2.6% in organic constant currency), respectively. This included a constant currency revenue increase in France of 10.6% (13.2% as reported), primarily due to strong growth in our large client accounts within the staffing market and growth in our Proservia business, and an 8.3% constant currency increase (10.5% as reported) in the permanent recruitment business. This increase also included a constant currency revenue increase in Italy of 23.3% (26.4% as reported) due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 23.7% constant currency increase (26.0% as reported) in the permanent recruitment business. We also experienced constant currency revenue growth in Germany, the Netherlands, the Nordics, Spain and Belgium of 10.1%, 12.6%, 6.6%, 12.3%, and 4.5%, respectively (12.5%, 15.2%, 7.6%, 15.1% and 6.8%, respectively, as reported; 8.4%, 5.1% and 5.2%, in organic constant currency in the Netherlands, the Nordics and Spain, respectively); \nEmployment-Related Items\n \u2022 a 2.0% increase due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; and \nAPME\nIn 2017, revenues from services decreased 1.9% (-1.7% in constant currency) compared to 2016. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 6.3% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services, mainly due to the reduced staffing volumes in the manufacturing sector of the economy, a decrease in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector because of decreased demand by several large clients, a decrease in ManpowerGroup Solutions business due to a specific client loss and roll off of certain project work, and an unfavorable impact from one fewer billing day. In Other\nOUP margin for APME was 4.0%, 3.8% and 3.6% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The OUP margin increased in 2018 due to improved operating leverage on increased revenues and the improvement in the gross profit margin. The OUP margin increase in 2017 was due to the increase in our gross profit margin and better operational leverage, because we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nThe employment of contingent workers and permanent staff throughout the world results in the recognition of liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans, social program remittances and payroll tax audit exposures that require us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the proper reserve levels. These reserves involve significant estimates or judgments that are material to our financial statements.\nWe performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2018, 2017 and 2016, and there was no impairment of our goodwill as a result of our annual tests.\nCertain constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances are discussed throughout this report. A reconciliation of these Non-GAAP percent variances to the percent variances calculated based on our annual GAAP financial results is provided below. (See Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency on pages 26 and 27 for information.)\nlarge client accounts within the staffing market, growth in our Proservia business and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 10.5% (8.3% in constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. The increase in Italy was mostly due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and an increase of 26.0% (23.7% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of two fewer billing days. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 14.2% (10.8% in constant currency) in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, an increase of 15.1% (12.3% in constant currency; 5.2% in organic constant currency) in Spain primarily due to the increase in our Experis business, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 27.5% (23.9% in constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of two fewer billing days.\n\nInterest and other expenses are comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses. Interest and other expenses were $42.0 million in 2018 compared to $51.9 million in 2017. Net interest expense decreased $3.6 million in 2018 to $41.0 million from $44.6 million in 2017 due to the lower interest rate on our \u20ac500.0 million notes offered and sold in June 2018 compared to the interest rate on the \u20ac350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018 that were repaid in June 2018. Foreign exchange losses in 2018 were $1.4 million compared to $0.8 million in 2017. The increase in foreign exchange losses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the $2.5 million translation loss in Argentina as a result of the highly-inflationary designation of its economy as of July 1, 2018, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units and translation gains resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States in 2018. Miscellaneous income was $0.4 million in 2018 compared to miscellaneous expense of $6.5 million in 2017. The variance is primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a decrease in gains on the sale of investments by our minority-owned Swiss Franchise.\nSelling and administrative expenses increased 8.4% (8.2% in constant currency; 6.9% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase is due to the increase in salary-related costs because of higher headcount to support the increase in revenues and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of an acquisition, partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in 2018 from $1.4 million incurred in 2017 in Australia related to branch and back-office optimization. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 6.0% (5.9% in constant currency; 5.5% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs because of higher headcount to support the increases in revenues and due to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nWe evaluate performance based on operating unit profit ( OUP\u201d), which is equal to segment revenues less direct costs and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes.\nIn 2017, revenues from services in Southern Europe increased 15.5% (12.7% in constant currency) compared to 2016. In 2017, revenues from services increased 13.2% (10.6% in constant currency) in France and increased 26.4% (23.3% in constant currency) in Italy. The increase in France was primarily due to the strong growth in our\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the decreases in both our outplacement and talent management business gross profit margins and the change in business mix as the higher-margin outplacement business represented a lower percentage of the revenues mix. In 2017, gross profit margin decreased due to decreases in both our outplacement and talent management business gross profit margins.\nWe recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 26.0% in 2017, as compared to an effective rate of 36.7% in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the $73.7 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2017 as a result of the tax benefit from the enactment of the Tax Act, offset by the tax expense from French tax reform. These enactments resulted in the net reduction of United States tax liabilities of $247.4 million offset by the United States transition tax expense of $170.2 million and a decrease in the French deferred tax assets of $3.5 million. Excluding the impact of these enactments, our rate would have been 36.0%. This is higher than the United States federal statutory rate of 35%, the rate in effect prior to the Tax Act, due primarily to the French business tax and other permanent items, offset by the favorable impact from the adoption of the new accounting guidance for share-based payments effective January 1, 2017, the favorable settlement of an audit and the net release of valuation allowances.\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decrease in Italy's Manpower staffing margin as a result of business mix changes and pricing pressures, while France's staffing/interim margin was flat as the decrease in the CICE payroll tax credit rate and the loss of the December 2018 CICE subsidy as a result of the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019 were offset by various initiatives as well as favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of 17.5% (13.1% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In 2017, gross profit margin decreased compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in France's staffing margin, as a result of business mix changes in a competitive pricing environment as we have experienced growth in our lower-margin large client accounts and pricing pressures, partially offset by the increase in the CICE subsidy effective January 1, 2017, and decreases in Italy's Manpower staffing margin primarily due to pricing pressures and business mix changes. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 19.9% (17.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business.\nOUP margin for Right Management was 16.4%, 16.5% and 17.3% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The OUP margin for 2018 decreased due to the decline in our gross profit margin, partially offset by improved operational leverage and the decrease of restructuring costs incurred in 2018 compared to 2017. The OUP margin for 2017 decreased due to the decline in our gross profit margin and the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nRight Management\nBoth the \u20ac500.0 million notes and \u20ac400.0 million notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. A portion of these notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2018. For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, both net of taxes, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See the Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations section and Notes 8 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further information.)\n \u2022 a 20 basis point (0.20%) unfavorable impact due to the restructuring costs noted above. \nCash provided by net debt borrowings was $178.2 million and $5.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, compared to net debt repayments of $6.7 million in 2016. In June 2018, we offered and sold \u20ac500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026, with the net proceeds of \u20ac495.7 million predominantly used to repay our \u20ac350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018. (See the \"Euro Notes\" section below for further information.)\n \u2022 the unfavorable impact of approximately 0.4% in constant currency due to one fewer billing day in the year. \nThe CICE payroll tax credit is creditable against our current French income tax payable, with any remaining amount being paid after three years. In April 2018, March 2017 and March 2016, we sold substantially all of our CICE earned in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for net proceeds of $234.5 million (\u20ac190.9 million), $143.5 million (\u20ac133.0 million) and $143.1 million (\u20ac129.9 million), respectively. We derecognized these receivables upon the sale as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded as a reduction of the payroll tax credits earned in the respective years in cost of services.\nDuring 2018, the United States dollar was weaker, on average, relative to the currencies in Europe, having a favorable impact on our reported results. While our reported revenues from services increased 4.5% from 2017, our reported operating profit increased 0.9%, and our net earnings per share - diluted increased 6.5%, these results were impacted by the relative strength of other currencies against the United States dollar compared to 2017, and generally may overstate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 2.0% favorable impact on revenues from services, a 1.3% favorable impact on operating profit, and an approximately $0.08 per share favorable impact on net earnings per share - diluted. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act made broad changes to the United States tax code, including a reduction of the United States federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and a transition to a Territorial Tax regime resulting in a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of unremitted post-1986 non-United States earnings. The Tax Act also established new provisions related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\"), Foreign-Derived Intangible Income ( FDII\u201d) and a Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax ( BEAT\u201d). The computation of these new provisions is highly complex, and our estimates could significantly change as a result of new rules or guidance from the various standard-setting bodies.\nFinancial Measures\n\nConsolidated Results - 2017 compared to 2016\nAmericas\nCash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $331.2 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, we have no longer recorded United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. As of December 31, 2018, deferred taxes related to non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $1,729.3 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $15.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. We have an additional $292.5 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries for which we have not currently provided deferred taxes.\nSocial Program Remittances and Payroll Tax Audit Exposure\nThe year-over-year 30 basis point (-0.30%) decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to:\nAccounts receivable decreased to $5,276.1 million as of December 31, 2018 from $5,370.5 million as of December 31, 2017. This decrease is due to changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher Days Sales Outstanding (\"DSO\"). DSO increased by approximately two days from December 31, 2017, due primarily to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO.\n \u2022 the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $16.6 million incurred as a result of acquisitions in Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME; and \nCash provided by operating activities was $483.1, $400.9 and $600.0 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $198.3 million of cash in 2018, as compared to $78.9 million and $49.7 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in 2018 from 2017 was primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments and the contingent consideration of $24.1 million paid in 2018 in excess of the contingent consideration liabilities initially recognized on the acquisition date. The change in 2017 from 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to the growth in the business and changes in business mix, partially offset by the timing of collections and payments.\n \u2022 restructuring costs of $34.5 million incurred in 2017, comprised of $6.3 million in the Americas, $23.8 million in Northern Europe, $1.4 million in APME, $2.0 million in Right Management and $1.0 million in corporate expenses; \nOUP margin in Southern Europe was 5.0%, 5.1% and 5.1% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. France's OUP margin was 5.0%, 5.1% and 5.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. France's margin decrease in 2018 was primarily due an increase in expenses as we invest to support higher growth. Italy's OUP margin was 6.7%, 7.1% and 6.8% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Italy's margin decrease in 2018 was due to the decline in the gross profit margin and the restructuring costs incurred in 2018, partially offset by improved operational leverage, as we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses. Other Southern Europe's OUP margin was 3.5%, 3.5% and 3.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The margin in Southern Europe in 2017 was flat compared to 2016 as improved operational leverage on increased revenues was offset by the decrease in the gross profit margin.\nThe table below provides our reporting units' estimated fair values and carrying values, determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter, representing approximately 77% of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2018.\nWe experienced increasing demand in the first half of the year while demand softened to a nearly flat consolidated growth rate in the second half of the year, primarily driven by lower growth rates or declines in constant currency in most of our European markets, most notably France, Italy and Germany. Our 2018 results reflect a slower growth environment during the second half of the year in certain markets within Southern and Northern Europe, which when combined represented approximately 67% of our total consolidated revenues. We expect the European economic slowdown experienced in the second half of 2018 to continue into at least the first quarter of 2019. Beyond that, we cannot predict if the trend will continue, reverse or intensify. The constant currency revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to a decrease in Germany resulting from challenges with the implementation of new systems and actions taken to optimize our delivery channels that caused some client disruption, as well as softer demand from the manufacturing sector in that market. We experienced better performance from our Southern Europe segment than from our Northern Europe segment, as discussed below under \"Segment Results\" due to the revenue increases in Italy, France, and certain other markets within Southern Europe. France experienced uneven but declining economic conditions with certain economic indicators and business confidence measures reaching their lowest point during the second half of 2018.\n \u2022 a 50 basis point (-0.50%) favorable impact from better expense leverage as a result of our strong focus on productivity and efficiency; and \nIn Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 31%, 20%, 20%, 14% and 8%, respectively, of Northern Europe's revenues), revenues from services increased 1.2% (-2.0% in constant currency) in 2018 as compared to 2017. We experienced revenue growth in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 3.2%, 0.3%, 0.4% and 6.5%, respectively (-0.4%, 0.1%, -4.2%, and 2.0%, respectively, in constant currency) and a decline in Germany of 3.6% (-8.3% in constant currency). The Northern Europe constant currency revenue decrease is due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the decrease in Germany resulting from challenges with the implementation of new systems and actions taken to optimize our delivery channels that caused some client disruption, as well as softer demand from the manufacturing sector in that market. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Proservia business, a 6.6% increase (3.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, and increased demand for our Experis interim services, primarily within the IT sector in the United Kingdom.\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value.\nThe year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 7.0% (6.0% in constant currency and 5.5% in organic constant currency) was attributed to:\nOur gross profit margin in 2018 decreased compared to 2017 primarily due to the decline in our staffing/interim gross profit margin. The staffing/interim gross profit margin decline is due to the decrease in the CICE payroll tax credit rate in France and the loss of the December 2018 CICE subsidy as a result of the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019, and business mix changes in various countries. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018, primarily in France and Japan. The margin also declined due to the decreased demand in our outplacement business at Right Management. These declines were partially offset by the increase in our permanent recruitment business. The CICE payroll tax credit is accounted for as a reduction of our cost of services in the period, and has had a favorable impact on our consolidated gross margin, as well as margins in France and Southern Europe since 2013. The CICE program was replaced with new subsidies starting in January 2019 and we expect this replacement to have a\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nDuring 2018, the Internal Revenue Service issued new guidance affecting the computation of our 2017 transition tax liability. As a result of the new guidance and additional analysis of the impacts of the Tax Act, we revised our provisional estimates recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 and as a result, recorded a tax expense of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 a 1.9% increase due to the impact of changes in the currency exchange rates; and \nConstant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are included on pages 38 and 39.\nOur operating profit decreased in 2018, down 0.4% in constant currency (0.9% increase as reported) with operating profit margin down 20 basis points compared to 2017. Included in 2018 and 2017 were $39.3 million and $34.5 million, respectively, of restructuring costs primarily related to the integration of certain acquisitions and front-office, back-office and delivery-model optimization. Excluding the restructuring costs in both 2018 and 2017, our operating profit was down 0.2% in constant currency with operating profit margin down 10 basis points compared to 2017. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the growth in the business and enhance our productivity and technology and digital capabilities.\nThe year-over-year 40 basis point (-0.40%) decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to:\nThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2017 as compared to 2016.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nOur ManpowerGroup Solutions business had strong growth in 2018 in addition to a 6.9% constant currency increase (8.4% as reported) in our permanent recruitment business. At Right Management, we experienced a constant currency revenue decline for both our outplacement services, due to the counter-cyclical nature of this business, and our talent management services.\nWeighted average shares - diluted decreased 4.1% to 65.1 million in 2018 from 67.9 million in 2017. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2018 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2017, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards in 2018.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (\"EBITDA\")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgments, change of control and customary ERISA defaults.\nOther\n \u2022 the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $10.0 million incurred as a result of acquisitions in the Americas, Southern Europe and APME; partially offset by \n \u2022 a 1.0% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; and \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total approximately $190.3 million and $201.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively ($139.0 million and $149.3 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.3 million and $52.6 million for stand-by letters of credit, respectively). Guarantees primarily relate to bank accounts, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit relate to workers' compensation, operating leases and indebtedness. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.9 million for both 2018 and 2017.\n \u2022 a 0.6% increase due to the impact of changes in the currency exchange rates; partially offset by \n \u2022 our acquisitions in Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME, which added approximately 0.5% revenue growth to our consolidated results on a constant currency basis; partially offset by \n\n \u2022 a 1.1% constant currency decrease (-0.4% as reported) in other organic non-personnel related costs as a result of our strong focus on productivity and efficiency. \nGoodwill Impairment\nThe Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock in each of August 2018, July 2016 and October 2015. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. In 2018, we repurchased a total of 5.7 million shares, comprised of 2.9 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.8 million shares under the 2016 authorization, at a total cost of $500.7 million. In 2017, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $203.9 million under the 2016 authorization. In 2016, we repurchased a total of 6.6 million shares, comprised of 1.3 million shares under the 2016 authorization and 5.3 million shares under the 2015 authorization, at a total cost of $482.2 million. As of December 31, 2018, there were 3.1 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization and no shares remaining under the 2016 and 2015 authorizations.\nwill be in effect for each location. To the extent these estimates change during the year, or actual results differ from these estimates, our estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year.\nAmericas, revenues from services increased 6.6% (7.1% in constant currency) in 2017 compared to 2016. We experienced revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Colombia and Peru of 11.1%, 4.4%, 4.9%, 6.9%, and 10.9%, respectively (12.0%, 2.3%, 17.5%, 3.7%, and 7.1%, respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in Brazil of 10.4% (-17.0 in constant currency) due to the non-recurrence of the business associated with the Rio Olympics in 2016.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which utilization of the asset is not likely.\nFinancial Measures - Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency\nConstant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation\nWe recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 26.2% in 2018, as compared to an effective rate of 26.0% in 2017. The 26.2% effective tax rate for 2018 was higher than the United States federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the French business tax. In 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to increase to approximately 34% due primarily to the transition of the French CICE subsidy, which was non-taxable, to new subsidies in January 2019 that are taxable.\nOur \u20ac400.0 million aggregate principal amount 1.875% notes (the \"\u20ac400.0 million notes\") are due September 2022. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the \u20ac500.0 million notes or the \u20ac400.0 million notes.\nIncome Taxes\nSouthern Europe\nNet earnings per share - diluted was $8.56 in 2018 compared to $8.04 in 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.08 in 2018. Restructuring costs recorded in 2018 and 2017 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.46 and $0.41 per share, net of tax, for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The gain from the sale of the Netherlands' language translation business favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.06 per share, net of tax, for 2018. The translation loss from the Argentina highly-inflationary designation recorded in 2018 negatively impacted net earnings per share- diluted by approximately $0.04 per share, net of tax, for 2018. The net tax benefits related to the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") and the French tax reform positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.09 per share in 2017.\n \u2022 the favorable impact of approximately 0.4% as reported and in constant currency due to one additional billing day in the year; partially offset by \n \u2022 a 10 basis point (-0.10%) favorable impact from better expense leverage as a result of our strong focus on productivity and efficiency; and \nIn 2017, revenues from services for APME increased 6.7% (6.4% in constant currency; 6.1% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016. In Japan, revenues from services increased 1.0% (4.4% in constant currency) due to\n \u2022 an $8.4 million decrease related to a gain from the sale of a non-core language translation business in the Netherlands; and \nOur liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, of $34.2 million is excluded from the commitments above as we cannot determine the years in which these positions might ultimately be settled.\nIn 2018, selling and administrative expenses increased 9.4% (4.9% in constant currency; 4.8% in organic constant currency) compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount, restructuring costs of $5.4 million incurred in 2018, and an increase in non-personnel related costs to support the increase in revenues. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 8.9% (6.4% in constant currency; 5.7% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses as a result of higher headcount to support the increase in revenues, and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the acquisitions in Spain.\nindustry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe recorded net restructuring costs of $39.3 million and $34.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries. During 2018 and 2017, we made payments of $37.3 million and $25.5 million, respectively, out of our restructuring reserve. We expect a majority of the remaining $15.5 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2019.\nSee Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the impacts of the Tax Act. Such note is found in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\n \u2022 a 10 basis point (-0.10%) unfavorable impact from decreased demand in our outplacement business at Right Management. \n \u2022 restructuring costs of $39.3 million incurred in 2018, comprised of $0.3 million in the Americas, $5.4 million in Southern Europe, $33.3 million in Northern Europe and $0.3 million in Right Management, compared to $34.5 million incurred in 2017, comprised of $6.3 million the Americas, $23.8 million Northern Europe, $1.4 million in APME, $2.0 million in Right Management and $1.0 million in corporate expenses; \nIn 2018, we experienced uneven results as we saw constant currency revenue declines in the United States, Northern Europe, and Right Management, while we saw constant-currency revenue growth in Other Americas, France, Italy, Other Southern Europe and APME. Our consolidated revenues were up 2.5% in constant currency in 2018 compared to 2017.\nInterest and other expenses are comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses. Interest and other expenses were $51.9 million in 2017 compared to $44.2 million in 2016. Net interest expense decreased $1.3 million in 2017 to $44.6 million from $45.9 million in 2016 due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher interest rates on investments. Foreign exchange losses in 2017 were $0.8 million compared to $2.8 million in 2016. The foreign exchange losses in 2017 were primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units, partially offset by translation gains resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States. The foreign exchange losses in 2016 were primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units, translation losses resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States, and a foreign currency loss as a result of the change in the exchange rate in our Venezuela reporting unit. Miscellaneous expense was $6.5 million in 2017 compared to miscellaneous income of $4.5 million in 2016. The variance between 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to a $6.9 million pension curtailment gain in 2016 and an increase in expenses related to net earnings\n\nThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2018 as compared to 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2018, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2018 acquisitions were $6.1 and $0.7, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2017 acquisitions were $35.0 and $13.3, respectively, the majority of which took place in India and Hong Kong.", "item_7_text": "Our principal ongoing cash needs are to finance working capital, capital expenditures, debt payments, interest expense, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. Working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables, which generally increase as revenues increase. The amount of financing necessary to support revenue growth depends on receivables turnover, which differs in each market where we operate.\nThe calculations of annual pension expense and the pension liability required at year-end include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, compensation increases and employee turnover rates. We review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions as necessary. We review market data and historical rates, on a country-by-country basis, to check for reasonableness in setting both the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected returns of the various investment asset classes held in the plans. We estimate compensation increases and employee turnover rates for each plan based on the historical rates and the expected future rates for each respective country. Changes to any of these assumptions will impact the level of annual expense recorded related to the plans.\n \u2022 a 0.8% increase in constant currency (1.5% as reported) in organic salary-related costs, primarily because of additional headcount to support the increased demand for our services specifically in Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME; \nIn 2018, revenues from services in Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, increased 8.3% (4.0% in constant currency) compared to 2017. In 2018, revenues from services increased 6.4% (1.9% in constant currency) in France (which represents 62% of Southern Europe's revenues) and increased 13.2% (8.3% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 18% of Southern Europe's revenues). The increase in France is primarily due to the strong growth in our large client accounts within the staffing market in the first half of the year and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 14.5% (9.1% in constant currency). The increase in Italy is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 15.9% increase (10.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 9.9% (6.8% in constant currency, 6.1% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the 9.0% increase (4.4% in constant currency; 2.5% in organic constant currency) in Spain, the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 21.9% (19.1% in constant currency) and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business.\nEuro Notes\nUnder the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 12.5 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 100.0 basis points on any borrowings. A downgrade from both credit agencies would unfavorably impact our facility fees and result in additional costs ranging from approximately $0.2 million to $0.8 million annually.\n \u2022 a revenue increase in APME of 9.6% (9.4% in constant currency and 8.7% in organic constant currency) primarily due to an increase in our staffing/interim revenues and a 9.9% increase (10.2% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business; \nWe sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees. The most significant plans are located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and France. Annual expense relating to these plans was $13.9 million, $11.2 million and $3.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is estimated to be approximately $15.1 million in 2019. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost (\"net benefit cost\"). The new guidance requires bifurcation of net benefit cost, which used to be reported as an employee cost within operating income under the old guidance. The service cost component is still presented with other employee compensation cost in operating income or capitalized in assets in rare circumstances. The other components are now reported separately outside of operations, and are not eligible for capitalization. We have reclassified the prior year non-service cost components of net benefit cost to interest and other expenses from selling and administrative expenses to conform to the current period presentation. The non-service cost components related to our defined benefit pension plans were a net cost of $3.0 million and $1.1 million and a net credit of $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The new subsidies and their anticipated impact is discussed in the section, \"Legal Regulations,\" found in Item 1. \"Business.\"\nIn 2017, revenues from services decreased 15.8% (-15.6% in constant currency). The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of 15.3% (-14.9% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as we experienced softer demand in many of our markets due to the counter-cyclical nature of this business and the non-recurrence of certain client activity within the United States. Our talent management business decreased 17.6% (-18.0% in constant currency) in 2017 compared to 2016 mostly due to softening demand in our Asian markets.\n \u2022 a 30 basis point (-0.30%) unfavorable impact from the decline in our Manpower staffing margin, particularly in France, Italy, Germany, and the Nordics, due primarily to changes in business mix; and \n \u2022 a 15.8% increase in constant currency (16.8% as reported; 14.6% in organic constant currency) in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities; \n \u2022 a 10 basis point (-0.10%) decrease due to the impact on business mix of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by \nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe 3.2% increase in selling and administrative expenses in 2018 (1.3% in constant currency; 1.0% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to:\nNorthern Europe\n \u2022 a 10 basis point (-0.10%) favorable impact due to the decrease in variable incentive costs; partially offset by \nIn 2018, selling and administrative expenses decreased 9.7% (-10.6% in constant currency) compared to 2017 primarily due to reduced compensation-related expenses, such as salaries and variable-incentive costs, due to lower headcount, and the decrease in restructuring costs incurred in 2018 compared to 2017. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses decreased 15.4% (-15.1% in constant currency) compared to 2016 due to reduced compensation-related expenses such as salaries and variable-incentive costs due to lower headcount and a decrease in office-related costs related to a decrease in the number of offices. These items were partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nIn 2018, revenues from services for Right Management decreased 8.5% (-9.4% in constant currency). The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of 10.3% (-11.3% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as we experienced reduced demand in most of our markets due to the counter-cyclical nature of this business. Our talent management business decreased 2.9% (-3.3% in constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decline in our Americas markets.\nWe have aggregate commitments of $2,202.2 million related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments, as follows:\nOn June 22, 2018, we offered and sold \u20ac500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026 (the \u20ac500.0 million notes\u201d). The net proceeds from the \u20ac500.0 million notes of \u20ac495.7 million were used to repay our \u20ac350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The \u20ac500.0 million notes were issued at a price of 99.564% to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809%. Interest on the \u20ac500.0 million notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The \u20ac500.0 million notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities.\nWe make an estimate of the additional remittances that may be required on a country-by-country basis, and record the estimate as a component of cost of services or selling and administrative expenses, as appropriate. Each country's estimate is based on the results of past audits and the number of years that have not yet been audited, with consideration for changing business volumes and changes to the payroll tax regulations. To the extent that our actual experience differs from our estimates, we will need to make adjustments to our reserve balance, which will impact the results of the related operation and the operating segment in which it is reported. Other than France, we have not had any significant adjustments to the amounts recorded as a result of any payroll tax audits, and we do not expect any significant adjustments to the recorded amounts in the near term.\nResults of Operations - For Years of Operation Ending December 31, 2018 and 2017\nWe provide for income taxes on a quarterly basis based on an estimated annual tax rate. In determining this rate, we make estimates about taxable income for each of our largest locations worldwide, as well as the tax rate that\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nConsolidated Results - 2018 compared to 2017\n \u2022 a revenue increase in APME of 6.4% in constant currency (6.7% as reported; 6.1% in organic constant currency) primarily due to an increase in our staffing/interim revenues, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and a 10.8% constant currency increase (12.1% as reported) in our permanent recruitment business; and \nIn determining the estimated 2019 pension expense for non-United States plans, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 2.4% compared to 2.1% for 2018, reflecting the current interest rate environment. We have selected a weighted-average expected return on plan assets of 2.4% for the non-United States plans in determining the 2019 estimated pension expense compared to 2.7% used for the calculation of the 2018 pension expense. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase and decrease in the weighted-average discount rate would impact our 2019 consolidated pension expense by a decrease of approximately $0.5 million and an increase of approximately $0.3 million, respectively. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the weighted-average expected return on plan assets would correspondingly decrease or increase our 2019 consolidated pension expense by approximately $0.9 million. Changes to these assumptions have historically not been significant in any jurisdiction for any reporting period, and no significant adjustments to the amounts recorded have been required in the past or are expected in the future. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further information.)\nTotal capitalization as of December 31, 2018 was $3,773.9 million, comprised of $1,075.4 million in debt and $2,698.5 million in equity.

In the United States, OUP margin was 5.2%, 5.7% and 5.0% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The margin decrease in 2018 in the United States was primarily due to the increased costs as a result of investment in certain technology and back-office and delivery model optimization activities and the decline in the gross profit margin, partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs. Other Americas OUP margin was 4.5%, 3.9% and 3.7% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The margin increased in Other Americas in 2018 compared to 2017 due to improved operational leverage, as we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2018 and a decrease in the gross profit margin. The margin increase in the Americas in 2017 was primarily due to the United States as a result of the improvement in the gross profit margin and strong cost management, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nSelling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 10 basis points (-0.10%) in 2018 compared to 2017. The change in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues consisted of:\nSignificant assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2018 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates ranging from 10.6% to 14.2%, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance.\n \u2022 a revenue decrease in the United States of 6.3% primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services, mainly due to the prolonged weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy, a decrease in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector due to decreased demand at several large clients, and a decrease in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, due to a specific client loss and roll off of certain project work; \nNet earnings per share - diluted was $8.04 in 2017 compared to $6.27 in 2016. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.10 in 2017. The net tax benefits related to the Tax Act and the French tax reform positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.09 per share in 2017. Restructuring costs recorded in 2017 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.41 per share, net of tax. The tax benefit related to the favorable settlement of an audit and the adoption of new accounting guidance for share-based payments positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.13 and $0.09, respectively, in 2017. We adopted the new accounting guidance for share-based payments in January 2017 and it required all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from share-based compensation to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement rather than capital in excess of par value on a prospective basis.\nOn June 18, 2018, we amended and restated our Five Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks, principally to revise the termination date of the facility from September 16, 2020 to June 18, 2023. The remaining material terms and conditions of the Agreement are substantially similar to the previous agreement. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $600.0 million in various currencies, and up to $150.0 million may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. We had no borrowings under this facility as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $0.5 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million and $599.2 million were available to us under the facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIn addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2018, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $319.9 million, of which $269.1 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $249.2 million could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2018.\nOccasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations to optimize our global strategic positioning and synergies. In December 2018, we sold one of our business units in the Netherlands for net cash proceeds of $13.2 million and divested a majority interest in a consolidated entity in China with an immaterial cash impact.\nWhen we use the term constant currency,\u201d it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated.\nRevenues from services increased 9.6% (9.4% in constant currency; 8.7% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. In Japan (which represents 31% of APME's revenues), revenues from services increased 4.7% (3.1% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 16.1% increase (14.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia (which represents 20% of APME's revenues), revenue from services increased 2.4% (5.1% in constant currency) due to the increase in our Manpower staffing business and a 4.6% increase (6.9% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, mostly in India, Greater China, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia and an increase in our permanent recruitment businesses.\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes and lower associate utilization in Germany, partially offset by the increase in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and increase in our permanent recruitment business. In 2017, gross profit margin was flat compared to 2016 as the increase in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and increase in our permanent recruitment business was offset by the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes.\n \u2022 decreased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues decreased 8.5% (-9.4% in constant currency), including a 10.3% decrease (-11.3% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as well as a 2.9% decrease (-3.3% in constant currency) in our talent management business. \nChanges in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and dispositions. We provide constant currency\u201d and organic constant currency\u201d calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage.\n \u2022 increased demand for services in several of our markets within Southern Europe and Northern Europe, where revenues increased 8.3% (4.0% in constant currency) and 1.2% (-2.0% in constant currency), respectively. This included a revenue increase in France of 6.4% (1.9% in constant currency), primarily due to strong growth in our large client accounts within the staffing market and a 14.5% increase (9.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. The Southern Europe increase also included an increase in Italy of 13.2% (8.3% in constant currency) due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 15.9% increase (10.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. We also experienced revenue growth in the Nordics, Spain and Belgium of 0.3%, 9.0% and 6.5%, respectively (0.1%, 4.4%, and 2.0%, respectively, in constant currency; 2.5%, in organic constant currency in Spain). Lastly, we experienced revenue growth in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands of 3.2% and 0.4%, respectively, while revenues decreased 0.4% and 4.2%, respectively, in constant currency; \nIn 2018, selling and administrative expenses decreased 2.8% (-0.7% in constant currency; -1.4% in organic constant currency), due primarily to strong cost management and a decline in salary-related expenses as a result of lower headcount in the United States and a decrease in restructuring costs to $0.3 million in 2018 from $6.3 million in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by increased costs related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of an acquisition in Other Americas. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses decreased 4.1% (-3.8% in constant currency), due primarily to strong cost management and a decline in salary-related expenses as a result of lower headcount. These decreases were partially offset by $6.3 million of restructuring costs incurred in 2017 primarily related to severance costs incurred in connection with United States back-office optimization and an increase in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities.\nOur judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded. Our net deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted in the event that tax rates are modified, or our estimates of future taxable income change, such that deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled at a different tax rate than currently estimated. In addition, valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the event that our estimates of future taxable income change. We have unrecognized tax benefits related to items in various countries and territories. To the extent these items are settled for an amount different than we currently expect, the unrecognized tax benefit will be adjusted.\nThe accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions requires an evaluation process for all tax positions taken that involves a review of probability for sustaining a tax position. If the probability for sustaining a tax position is more likely than not, which is a 50% threshold, then the tax position is warranted and the largest amount, based on cumulative probability, that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement is recognized. An uncertain tax position, one which does not meet the 50% threshold, will not be recognized in the financial statements.\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to business mix changes within our staffing/interim business, as revenue growth came from our lower-margin entities within Other Americas as well as a decline in the United States' staffing/interim margin due to the non-recurrence of certain prior year favorable reductions related to workers' compensation and health care costs in the United States. In 2017, gross profit margin increased compared to 2016 as a result of improved staffing/interim margin in the United States due to lower direct costs primarily related to workers' compensation and health care costs, partially offset by decreases in our staffing/interim margins within some of our markets in Other Americas because of business mix changes.\n \u2022 a 15.5% increase (13.3% in constant currency and 13.1% in organic constant currency) in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects, delivery model and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities; \nOn a routine basis, various governmental agencies in some of the countries and territories in which we operate audit our payroll tax calculations and our compliance with other payroll-related regulations. These audits focus primarily on documentation requirements and our support for our payroll tax remittances. Due to the nature of our business, the number of people that we employ, and the complexity of some payroll tax regulations, we may have some adjustments to the payroll tax remittances as a result of these audits.\nSelling and administrative expenses increased 2.0% (-1.8% in constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to the increase in restructuring costs of $33.3 million in 2018 from $23.8 million in 2017. The 2018 restructuring costs related to delivery model and other front-office centralization activities as well as back-office optimization activities primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium. The 2017 restructuring costs were primarily related to severance costs incurred in connection with the further integration of 7S Group GmbH (\"7S\") in Germany, branch and back-office optimization in the United Kingdom and management and back-office optimization along with the integration of an Experis acquisition in the Netherlands. Excluding the restructuring costs, selling and administrative expenses decreased 2.7% in constant currency (increase of 0.8% as reported) primarily due to a $8.4 million gain from the sale of a non-core language translation business in the Netherlands and a decrease in salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction of headcount, partially offset by an increase in consulting costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 8.4% (8.3% in constant currency; 7.0% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016 due primarily to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017. Excluding the restructuring costs, selling and administrative expenses increased 4.9% (4.5% in constant currency; 3.3% in organic constant currency), primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses as a result of higher headcount in certain countries to support the increase in revenues, the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the acquisitions in the Nordics and the Netherlands and an increase in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities.\n \u2022 decreased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues decreased 15.6% in constant currency (-15.8% as reported), including a 14.9% constant currency decrease (-15.3% as reported) in our outplacement services as well as an 18.0% constant currency decline (-17.6% as reported) in our talent management business; \nOur long-term debt has a rating of Baa1 from Moody's Investor Services and BBB from Standard and Poor's, both with a stable outlook. Both of the credit ratings are investment grade. Rating agencies use proprietary methodology in determining their ratings and outlook which includes, among other things, financial ratios based upon debt levels and earnings performance.\n\n \u2022 a revenue decrease in the United States of 5.1% primarily driven by a decline in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector because of decreased demand from larger clients, a decline in our Manpower staffing services due to reduced demand from certain clients, and a 3.2% decrease in the permanent recruitment business; and \nattributable to noncontrolling interests in 2017 compared to 2016, partially offset by a gain on the sale of investments by our minority-owned Swiss Franchise recorded in 2017.\nFrom time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $51.8 million, $45.7 million and $60.5 million, respectively. The 2018 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $9.1 million and contingent consideration payments of $42.7 million ($18.6 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date). The 2017 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $32.7 million and contingent consideration related to previous acquisitions of $13.0 million, of which $10.3 million was related to our 2015 acquisition of 7S in Germany. The 2016 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $57.6 million and contingent consideration payments of $2.9 million.\nWhen we use the term organic constant currency,\u201d it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business.\n\n \u2022 our acquisitions in the Americas, Southern Europe, and APME, which added approximately 0.3% revenue growth to our consolidated results; \nGross profit margin increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the improvement in our staffing/interim margin as a result of favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018 in Japan, increase in our permanent recruitment business of 9.9% (10.2% in constant currency), and a margin increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. In 2017, gross profit margin increased compared to 2016 due to an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 12.1% (10.8% in constant currency) and growth in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business, partially offset by a decrease in our staffing/interim margins as a result of direct cost increases in certain markets and changes in business mix.\nWeighted average shares - diluted decreased 4.2% to 67.9 million in 2017 from 70.8 million in 2016. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2017 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2016, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards in 2017.\nCapital expenditures were $64.7 million, $54.7 million and $56.9 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs of $5.6 million in 2018, $1.7 million in 2017 and $0.9 million in 2016.\n \u2022 a 10 basis point (-0.10%) unfavorable impact from decreased demand in our outplacement business at Right Management; partially offset by \nAs defined in the Credit Agreement, we had a net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.97 to 1 (compared to the maximum allowable ratio of 3.5 to 1) and a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 5.35 to 1 (compared to the minimum required ratio of 1.5 to 1) as of December 31, 2018.\nSelling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 40 basis points (-0.40%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The change in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues consisted of:\nThe year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 4.5% (2.5% in constant currency and 2.2% in organic constant currency) was attributed to:\nThe 4.1% increase in selling and administrative expenses in 2017 (3.5% in constant currency; 2.9% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to:\nIn the Americas, revenues from services decreased 1.4% (increase of 1.3% in constant currency and 0.4% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 5.1% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by a decline in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector because of decreased demand from larger clients, a decline in our Manpower staffing services due to reduced demand from certain clients, and a 3.2% decrease in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 5.1% (12.4% in constant currency; 9.9% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. We experienced constant currency revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Brazil of 8.3%, 9.5%, 15.2%, 14.9%, 4.5%, and 14.0% (6.2%, 9.3%, -27.6%, 14.6%, 3.6%, and -0.1%, respectively, as reported). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. There has been a steady devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar in the last few years. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 a 30 basis point (-0.30%) unfavorable impact from the decline in our staffing/interim margin due to the decrease in the CICE payroll tax credit rate in France and the loss of the December 2018 CICE subsidy as a result of the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019 and business mix changes in various countries, partially offset by favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018, primarily in France and Japan.; and \nIn 2017, revenues from services increased 3.5% (3.4% in constant currency; 2.6% in organic constant currency) as compared to 2016. We experienced revenue growth in Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 12.5%, 7.6%, 15.2% and 6.8%, respectively (10.1%, 6.6%, 12.6%, and 4.5%, respectively, in constant currency; 5.1% and 8.4% in organic constant currency in the Nordics and the Netherlands) and a decline in the United Kingdom of 11.1% (-6.5% in constant currency). The Northern Europe revenue increase is due to growth in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, mostly within our Proservia business, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 4.6% increase (5.7% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. These increases were partially offset by reduced demand within our largest client accounts in the United Kingdom and the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day.\nThe constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our\nCash Sources and Uses\nSegment Results\n \u2022 a 3.1% decrease (-4.9% in constant currency and -5.2% in organic constant currency) in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in certain markets. \nthe increase in our staffing/interim business and a 10.7% increase (14.5% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia, revenue from services decreased 1.0% in constant currency (increase of 2.1% as reported) due to the decrease in demand for our Manpower staffing services in constant currency as we saw a slowing of new business and the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day, partially offset by a 7.2% increase in constant currency (10.7% as reported) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, mostly in Greater China, India, Singapore and Thailand, and growth in our ManpowerGroup Solutions and permanent recruitment businesses.\nOUP margin for Northern Europe was 2.3%, 2.6% and 3.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the gross profit margin, the increased costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities, and an increase in restructuring costs in 2018 compared to 2017. The OUP margin decreased in 2017 primarily due to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017 and the increase in consulting costs.\n \u2022 increased demand for services in several of our markets within Southern Europe and Northern Europe, where in constant currency revenues increased 12.7% (15.5% as reported) and 3.4% (3.5% as reported; 2.6% in organic constant currency), respectively. This included a constant currency revenue increase in France of 10.6% (13.2% as reported), primarily due to strong growth in our large client accounts within the staffing market and growth in our Proservia business, and an 8.3% constant currency increase (10.5% as reported) in the permanent recruitment business. This increase also included a constant currency revenue increase in Italy of 23.3% (26.4% as reported) due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 23.7% constant currency increase (26.0% as reported) in the permanent recruitment business. We also experienced constant currency revenue growth in Germany, the Netherlands, the Nordics, Spain and Belgium of 10.1%, 12.6%, 6.6%, 12.3%, and 4.5%, respectively (12.5%, 15.2%, 7.6%, 15.1% and 6.8%, respectively, as reported; 8.4%, 5.1% and 5.2%, in organic constant currency in the Netherlands, the Nordics and Spain, respectively); \nEmployment-Related Items\n \u2022 a 2.0% increase due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; and \nAPME\nIn 2017, revenues from services decreased 1.9% (-1.7% in constant currency) compared to 2016. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 6.3% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services, mainly due to the reduced staffing volumes in the manufacturing sector of the economy, a decrease in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector because of decreased demand by several large clients, a decrease in ManpowerGroup Solutions business due to a specific client loss and roll off of certain project work, and an unfavorable impact from one fewer billing day. In Other\nOUP margin for APME was 4.0%, 3.8% and 3.6% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The OUP margin increased in 2018 due to improved operating leverage on increased revenues and the improvement in the gross profit margin. The OUP margin increase in 2017 was due to the increase in our gross profit margin and better operational leverage, because we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nThe employment of contingent workers and permanent staff throughout the world results in the recognition of liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans, social program remittances and payroll tax audit exposures that require us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the proper reserve levels. These reserves involve significant estimates or judgments that are material to our financial statements.\nWe performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2018, 2017 and 2016, and there was no impairment of our goodwill as a result of our annual tests.\nCertain constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances are discussed throughout this report. A reconciliation of these Non-GAAP percent variances to the percent variances calculated based on our annual GAAP financial results is provided below. (See Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency on pages 26 and 27 for information.)\nlarge client accounts within the staffing market, growth in our Proservia business and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 10.5% (8.3% in constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. The increase in Italy was mostly due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and an increase of 26.0% (23.7% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of two fewer billing days. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 14.2% (10.8% in constant currency) in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, an increase of 15.1% (12.3% in constant currency; 5.2% in organic constant currency) in Spain primarily due to the increase in our Experis business, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 27.5% (23.9% in constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of two fewer billing days.\n\nInterest and other expenses are comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses. Interest and other expenses were $42.0 million in 2018 compared to $51.9 million in 2017. Net interest expense decreased $3.6 million in 2018 to $41.0 million from $44.6 million in 2017 due to the lower interest rate on our \u20ac500.0 million notes offered and sold in June 2018 compared to the interest rate on the \u20ac350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018 that were repaid in June 2018. Foreign exchange losses in 2018 were $1.4 million compared to $0.8 million in 2017. The increase in foreign exchange losses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the $2.5 million translation loss in Argentina as a result of the highly-inflationary designation of its economy as of July 1, 2018, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units and translation gains resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States in 2018. Miscellaneous income was $0.4 million in 2018 compared to miscellaneous expense of $6.5 million in 2017. The variance is primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a decrease in gains on the sale of investments by our minority-owned Swiss Franchise.\nSelling and administrative expenses increased 8.4% (8.2% in constant currency; 6.9% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase is due to the increase in salary-related costs because of higher headcount to support the increase in revenues and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of an acquisition, partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in 2018 from $1.4 million incurred in 2017 in Australia related to branch and back-office optimization. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 6.0% (5.9% in constant currency; 5.5% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs because of higher headcount to support the increases in revenues and due to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nWe evaluate performance based on operating unit profit ( OUP\u201d), which is equal to segment revenues less direct costs and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes.\nIn 2017, revenues from services in Southern Europe increased 15.5% (12.7% in constant currency) compared to 2016. In 2017, revenues from services increased 13.2% (10.6% in constant currency) in France and increased 26.4% (23.3% in constant currency) in Italy. The increase in France was primarily due to the strong growth in our\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the decreases in both our outplacement and talent management business gross profit margins and the change in business mix as the higher-margin outplacement business represented a lower percentage of the revenues mix. In 2017, gross profit margin decreased due to decreases in both our outplacement and talent management business gross profit margins.\nWe recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 26.0% in 2017, as compared to an effective rate of 36.7% in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the $73.7 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2017 as a result of the tax benefit from the enactment of the Tax Act, offset by the tax expense from French tax reform. These enactments resulted in the net reduction of United States tax liabilities of $247.4 million offset by the United States transition tax expense of $170.2 million and a decrease in the French deferred tax assets of $3.5 million. Excluding the impact of these enactments, our rate would have been 36.0%. This is higher than the United States federal statutory rate of 35%, the rate in effect prior to the Tax Act, due primarily to the French business tax and other permanent items, offset by the favorable impact from the adoption of the new accounting guidance for share-based payments effective January 1, 2017, the favorable settlement of an audit and the net release of valuation allowances.\nGross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decrease in Italy's Manpower staffing margin as a result of business mix changes and pricing pressures, while France's staffing/interim margin was flat as the decrease in the CICE payroll tax credit rate and the loss of the December 2018 CICE subsidy as a result of the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019 were offset by various initiatives as well as favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of 17.5% (13.1% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In 2017, gross profit margin decreased compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in France's staffing margin, as a result of business mix changes in a competitive pricing environment as we have experienced growth in our lower-margin large client accounts and pricing pressures, partially offset by the increase in the CICE subsidy effective January 1, 2017, and decreases in Italy's Manpower staffing margin primarily due to pricing pressures and business mix changes. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 19.9% (17.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business.\nOUP margin for Right Management was 16.4%, 16.5% and 17.3% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The OUP margin for 2018 decreased due to the decline in our gross profit margin, partially offset by improved operational leverage and the decrease of restructuring costs incurred in 2018 compared to 2017. The OUP margin for 2017 decreased due to the decline in our gross profit margin and the restructuring costs incurred in 2017.\nRight Management\nBoth the \u20ac500.0 million notes and \u20ac400.0 million notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. A portion of these notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2018. For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, both net of taxes, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See the Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations section and Notes 8 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further information.)\n \u2022 a 20 basis point (0.20%) unfavorable impact due to the restructuring costs noted above. \nCash provided by net debt borrowings was $178.2 million and $5.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, compared to net debt repayments of $6.7 million in 2016. In June 2018, we offered and sold \u20ac500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026, with the net proceeds of \u20ac495.7 million predominantly used to repay our \u20ac350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018. (See the \"Euro Notes\" section below for further information.)\n \u2022 the unfavorable impact of approximately 0.4% in constant currency due to one fewer billing day in the year. \nThe CICE payroll tax credit is creditable against our current French income tax payable, with any remaining amount being paid after three years. In April 2018, March 2017 and March 2016, we sold substantially all of our CICE earned in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for net proceeds of $234.5 million (\u20ac190.9 million), $143.5 million (\u20ac133.0 million) and $143.1 million (\u20ac129.9 million), respectively. We derecognized these receivables upon the sale as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded as a reduction of the payroll tax credits earned in the respective years in cost of services.\nDuring 2018, the United States dollar was weaker, on average, relative to the currencies in Europe, having a favorable impact on our reported results. While our reported revenues from services increased 4.5% from 2017, our reported operating profit increased 0.9%, and our net earnings per share - diluted increased 6.5%, these results were impacted by the relative strength of other currencies against the United States dollar compared to 2017, and generally may overstate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 2.0% favorable impact on revenues from services, a 1.3% favorable impact on operating profit, and an approximately $0.08 per share favorable impact on net earnings per share - diluted. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act made broad changes to the United States tax code, including a reduction of the United States federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and a transition to a Territorial Tax regime resulting in a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of unremitted post-1986 non-United States earnings. The Tax Act also established new provisions related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\"), Foreign-Derived Intangible Income ( FDII\u201d) and a Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax ( BEAT\u201d). The computation of these new provisions is highly complex, and our estimates could significantly change as a result of new rules or guidance from the various standard-setting bodies.\nFinancial Measures\n\nConsolidated Results - 2017 compared to 2016\nAmericas\nCash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $331.2 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, we have no longer recorded United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. As of December 31, 2018, deferred taxes related to non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $1,729.3 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $15.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. We have an additional $292.5 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries for which we have not currently provided deferred taxes.\nSocial Program Remittances and Payroll Tax Audit Exposure\nThe year-over-year 30 basis point (-0.30%) decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to:\nAccounts receivable decreased to $5,276.1 million as of December 31, 2018 from $5,370.5 million as of December 31, 2017. This decrease is due to changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher Days Sales Outstanding (\"DSO\"). DSO increased by approximately two days from December 31, 2017, due primarily to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO.\n \u2022 the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $16.6 million incurred as a result of acquisitions in Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME; and \nCash provided by operating activities was $483.1, $400.9 and $600.0 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $198.3 million of cash in 2018, as compared to $78.9 million and $49.7 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in 2018 from 2017 was primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments and the contingent consideration of $24.1 million paid in 2018 in excess of the contingent consideration liabilities initially recognized on the acquisition date. The change in 2017 from 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to the growth in the business and changes in business mix, partially offset by the timing of collections and payments.\n \u2022 restructuring costs of $34.5 million incurred in 2017, comprised of $6.3 million in the Americas, $23.8 million in Northern Europe, $1.4 million in APME, $2.0 million in Right Management and $1.0 million in corporate expenses; \nOUP margin in Southern Europe was 5.0%, 5.1% and 5.1% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. France's OUP margin was 5.0%, 5.1% and 5.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. France's margin decrease in 2018 was primarily due an increase in expenses as we invest to support higher growth. Italy's OUP margin was 6.7%, 7.1% and 6.8% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Italy's margin decrease in 2018 was due to the decline in the gross profit margin and the restructuring costs incurred in 2018, partially offset by improved operational leverage, as we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses. Other Southern Europe's OUP margin was 3.5%, 3.5% and 3.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The margin in Southern Europe in 2017 was flat compared to 2016 as improved operational leverage on increased revenues was offset by the decrease in the gross profit margin.\nThe table below provides our reporting units' estimated fair values and carrying values, determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter, representing approximately 77% of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2018.\nWe experienced increasing demand in the first half of the year while demand softened to a nearly flat consolidated growth rate in the second half of the year, primarily driven by lower growth rates or declines in constant currency in most of our European markets, most notably France, Italy and Germany. Our 2018 results reflect a slower growth environment during the second half of the year in certain markets within Southern and Northern Europe, which when combined represented approximately 67% of our total consolidated revenues. We expect the European economic slowdown experienced in the second half of 2018 to continue into at least the first quarter of 2019. Beyond that, we cannot predict if the trend will continue, reverse or intensify. The constant currency revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to a decrease in Germany resulting from challenges with the implementation of new systems and actions taken to optimize our delivery channels that caused some client disruption, as well as softer demand from the manufacturing sector in that market. We experienced better performance from our Southern Europe segment than from our Northern Europe segment, as discussed below under \"Segment Results\" due to the revenue increases in Italy, France, and certain other markets within Southern Europe. France experienced uneven but declining economic conditions with certain economic indicators and business confidence measures reaching their lowest point during the second half of 2018.\n \u2022 a 50 basis point (-0.50%) favorable impact from better expense leverage as a result of our strong focus on productivity and efficiency; and \nIn Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 31%, 20%, 20%, 14% and 8%, respectively, of Northern Europe's revenues), revenues from services increased 1.2% (-2.0% in constant currency) in 2018 as compared to 2017. We experienced revenue growth in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 3.2%, 0.3%, 0.4% and 6.5%, respectively (-0.4%, 0.1%, -4.2%, and 2.0%, respectively, in constant currency) and a decline in Germany of 3.6% (-8.3% in constant currency). The Northern Europe constant currency revenue decrease is due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the decrease in Germany resulting from challenges with the implementation of new systems and actions taken to optimize our delivery channels that caused some client disruption, as well as softer demand from the manufacturing sector in that market. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Proservia business, a 6.6% increase (3.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, and increased demand for our Experis interim services, primarily within the IT sector in the United Kingdom.\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value.\nThe year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 7.0% (6.0% in constant currency and 5.5% in organic constant currency) was attributed to:\nOur gross profit margin in 2018 decreased compared to 2017 primarily due to the decline in our staffing/interim gross profit margin. The staffing/interim gross profit margin decline is due to the decrease in the CICE payroll tax credit rate in France and the loss of the December 2018 CICE subsidy as a result of the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019, and business mix changes in various countries. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018, primarily in France and Japan. The margin also declined due to the decreased demand in our outplacement business at Right Management. These declines were partially offset by the increase in our permanent recruitment business. The CICE payroll tax credit is accounted for as a reduction of our cost of services in the period, and has had a favorable impact on our consolidated gross margin, as well as margins in France and Southern Europe since 2013. The CICE program was replaced with new subsidies starting in January 2019 and we expect this replacement to have a\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nDuring 2018, the Internal Revenue Service issued new guidance affecting the computation of our 2017 transition tax liability. As a result of the new guidance and additional analysis of the impacts of the Tax Act, we revised our provisional estimates recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 and as a result, recorded a tax expense of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 a 1.9% increase due to the impact of changes in the currency exchange rates; and \nConstant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are included on pages 38 and 39.\nOur operating profit decreased in 2018, down 0.4% in constant currency (0.9% increase as reported) with operating profit margin down 20 basis points compared to 2017. Included in 2018 and 2017 were $39.3 million and $34.5 million, respectively, of restructuring costs primarily related to the integration of certain acquisitions and front-office, back-office and delivery-model optimization. Excluding the restructuring costs in both 2018 and 2017, our operating profit was down 0.2% in constant currency with operating profit margin down 10 basis points compared to 2017. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the growth in the business and enhance our productivity and technology and digital capabilities.\nThe year-over-year 40 basis point (-0.40%) decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to:\nThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2017 as compared to 2016.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nOur ManpowerGroup Solutions business had strong growth in 2018 in addition to a 6.9% constant currency increase (8.4% as reported) in our permanent recruitment business. At Right Management, we experienced a constant currency revenue decline for both our outplacement services, due to the counter-cyclical nature of this business, and our talent management services.\nWeighted average shares - diluted decreased 4.1% to 65.1 million in 2018 from 67.9 million in 2017. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2018 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2017, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards in 2018.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (\"EBITDA\")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgments, change of control and customary ERISA defaults.\nOther\n \u2022 the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $10.0 million incurred as a result of acquisitions in the Americas, Southern Europe and APME; partially offset by \n \u2022 a 1.0% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; and \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total approximately $190.3 million and $201.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively ($139.0 million and $149.3 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.3 million and $52.6 million for stand-by letters of credit, respectively). Guarantees primarily relate to bank accounts, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit relate to workers' compensation, operating leases and indebtedness. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.9 million for both 2018 and 2017.\n \u2022 a 0.6% increase due to the impact of changes in the currency exchange rates; partially offset by \n \u2022 our acquisitions in Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME, which added approximately 0.5% revenue growth to our consolidated results on a constant currency basis; partially offset by \n\n \u2022 a 1.1% constant currency decrease (-0.4% as reported) in other organic non-personnel related costs as a result of our strong focus on productivity and efficiency. \nGoodwill Impairment\nThe Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock in each of August 2018, July 2016 and October 2015. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. In 2018, we repurchased a total of 5.7 million shares, comprised of 2.9 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.8 million shares under the 2016 authorization, at a total cost of $500.7 million. In 2017, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $203.9 million under the 2016 authorization. In 2016, we repurchased a total of 6.6 million shares, comprised of 1.3 million shares under the 2016 authorization and 5.3 million shares under the 2015 authorization, at a total cost of $482.2 million. As of December 31, 2018, there were 3.1 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization and no shares remaining under the 2016 and 2015 authorizations.\nwill be in effect for each location. To the extent these estimates change during the year, or actual results differ from these estimates, our estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year.\nAmericas, revenues from services increased 6.6% (7.1% in constant currency) in 2017 compared to 2016. We experienced revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Colombia and Peru of 11.1%, 4.4%, 4.9%, 6.9%, and 10.9%, respectively (12.0%, 2.3%, 17.5%, 3.7%, and 7.1%, respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in Brazil of 10.4% (-17.0 in constant currency) due to the non-recurrence of the business associated with the Rio Olympics in 2016.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which utilization of the asset is not likely.\nFinancial Measures - Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency\nConstant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation\nWe recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 26.2% in 2018, as compared to an effective rate of 26.0% in 2017. The 26.2% effective tax rate for 2018 was higher than the United States federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the French business tax. In 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to increase to approximately 34% due primarily to the transition of the French CICE subsidy, which was non-taxable, to new subsidies in January 2019 that are taxable.\nOur \u20ac400.0 million aggregate principal amount 1.875% notes (the \"\u20ac400.0 million notes\") are due September 2022. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the \u20ac500.0 million notes or the \u20ac400.0 million notes.\nIncome Taxes\nSouthern Europe\nNet earnings per share - diluted was $8.56 in 2018 compared to $8.04 in 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.08 in 2018. Restructuring costs recorded in 2018 and 2017 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.46 and $0.41 per share, net of tax, for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The gain from the sale of the Netherlands' language translation business favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.06 per share, net of tax, for 2018. The translation loss from the Argentina highly-inflationary designation recorded in 2018 negatively impacted net earnings per share- diluted by approximately $0.04 per share, net of tax, for 2018. The net tax benefits related to the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") and the French tax reform positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.09 per share in 2017.\n \u2022 the favorable impact of approximately 0.4% as reported and in constant currency due to one additional billing day in the year; partially offset by \n \u2022 a 10 basis point (-0.10%) favorable impact from better expense leverage as a result of our strong focus on productivity and efficiency; and \nIn 2017, revenues from services for APME increased 6.7% (6.4% in constant currency; 6.1% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016. In Japan, revenues from services increased 1.0% (4.4% in constant currency) due to\n \u2022 an $8.4 million decrease related to a gain from the sale of a non-core language translation business in the Netherlands; and \nOur liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, of $34.2 million is excluded from the commitments above as we cannot determine the years in which these positions might ultimately be settled.\nIn 2018, selling and administrative expenses increased 9.4% (4.9% in constant currency; 4.8% in organic constant currency) compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount, restructuring costs of $5.4 million incurred in 2018, and an increase in non-personnel related costs to support the increase in revenues. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 8.9% (6.4% in constant currency; 5.7% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses as a result of higher headcount to support the increase in revenues, and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the acquisitions in Spain.\nindustry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe recorded net restructuring costs of $39.3 million and $34.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries. During 2018 and 2017, we made payments of $37.3 million and $25.5 million, respectively, out of our restructuring reserve. We expect a majority of the remaining $15.5 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2019.\nSee Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the impacts of the Tax Act. Such note is found in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\n \u2022 a 10 basis point (-0.10%) unfavorable impact from decreased demand in our outplacement business at Right Management. \n \u2022 restructuring costs of $39.3 million incurred in 2018, comprised of $0.3 million in the Americas, $5.4 million in Southern Europe, $33.3 million in Northern Europe and $0.3 million in Right Management, compared to $34.5 million incurred in 2017, comprised of $6.3 million the Americas, $23.8 million Northern Europe, $1.4 million in APME, $2.0 million in Right Management and $1.0 million in corporate expenses; \nIn 2018, we experienced uneven results as we saw constant currency revenue declines in the United States, Northern Europe, and Right Management, while we saw constant-currency revenue growth in Other Americas, France, Italy, Other Southern Europe and APME. Our consolidated revenues were up 2.5% in constant currency in 2018 compared to 2017.\nInterest and other expenses are comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses. Interest and other expenses were $51.9 million in 2017 compared to $44.2 million in 2016. Net interest expense decreased $1.3 million in 2017 to $44.6 million from $45.9 million in 2016 due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher interest rates on investments. Foreign exchange losses in 2017 were $0.8 million compared to $2.8 million in 2016. The foreign exchange losses in 2017 were primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units, partially offset by translation gains resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States. The foreign exchange losses in 2016 were primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units, translation losses resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States, and a foreign currency loss as a result of the change in the exchange rate in our Venezuela reporting unit. Miscellaneous expense was $6.5 million in 2017 compared to miscellaneous income of $4.5 million in 2016. The variance between 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to a $6.9 million pension curtailment gain in 2016 and an increase in expenses related to net earnings\n\nThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2018 as compared to 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2018, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2018 acquisitions were $6.1 and $0.7, respectively.

Revenues from services increased 4.5% (2.5% in constant currency, 2.2% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by growth in Southern Europe, Northern Europe, and APME. However, revenue declined in the US and at Right Management. \n\n- Operating profit was down 0.4% in constant currency in 2018 vs 2017. Restructuring costs of $39.3M in 2018 and $34.5M in 2017 impacted operating profit. Excluding restructuring costs, operating profit was down just 0.2% in constant currency.\n\n- Net earnings per share increased 6.5% in 2018 compared to 2017. Foreign exchange rates favorably impacted EPS by $0.08. Restructuring costs negatively impacted EPS by $0.46 per share in 2018.\n\n- The company repurchased $500.7M of its shares in 2018 as part of its share repurchase program. \n\n- The consolidated gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points in 2018 vs 2017 primarily due to declines in the staffing/interim gross profit margin and decreased demand at Right Management.\n\n- Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 10 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017 due to lower variable incentive costs and expense leverage, offset by restructuring costs.\n\n- Cash provided by operations was $483.1M in 2018 compared to $400.9M in 2017, attributed to timing of collections and payments.\n\nIn summary, the company saw mixed results in 2018, with uneven revenue growth across geographies, a slight decline in operating profit, higher EPS aided by currency, lower gross margin, and improved cash flow from operations."}
