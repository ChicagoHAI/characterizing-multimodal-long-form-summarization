MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGREAT PLAINS ENERGY INCORPORATED\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nDescription of Business\nGreat Plains Energy is a public utility holding company and does not own or operate any significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries.\nGreat Plains Energy's sole reportable business segment is electric utility. Electric utility consists of KCP&L, a regulated utility, GMO's regulated utility operations, which include its Missouri Public Service and St. Joseph Light & Power divisions, and GMO Receivables Company. Electric utility has approximately 6,400 MWs of owned generating capacity and engages in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 846,100 customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas. Electric utility's retail electricity rates are comparable to the national average of investor-owned utilities.\nGreat Plains Energy's corporate and other activities not included in the sole reportable business segment includes GMO activity other than its regulated utility operations, GPETHC and unallocated corporate charges.\n2015 Earnings Overview\nGreat Plains Energy's 2015 earnings available for common shareholders decreased to $211.4 million or $1.37 per share from $241.2 million or $1.57 per share in 2014 driven by:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $53.4 million increase in gross margin driven by new retail rates, an increase in weather-normalized retail demand, recovery of program costs for energy efficiency programs under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (MEEIA) and recovery of renewable energy costs under the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard Rate Adjustment Mechanism (RESRAM), both of which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense; partially offset by milder weather;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $22.9 million increase in utility operating and maintenance expenses primarily driven by an increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA and amortization of deferred renewable energy costs under RESRAM, both of which have a direct offset in revenue, partially offset by a decrease in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to decreased refueling outage amortization and a planned mid-cycle maintenance outage in 2014;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $24.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense driven by capital additions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an $8.6 million increase in general taxes driven by higher property taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $13.3 million decrease in non-operating income driven by a decrease in the equity component of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $10.8 million increase in interest charges primarily due to lower interest expense in 2014 related to the release of uncertain tax positions and a decrease in the debt component of AFUDC; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $7.0 million increase in income tax expense primarily driven by income tax benefits in 2014 related to the release of uncertain tax positions partially offset by decreased pre-tax income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Gross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). See the explanation of gross margin and the reconciliation to GAAP operating revenues under Great Plains Energy's Results of Operations for further information.\nFor additional information regarding the change in earnings, refer to the Great Plains Energy Results of Operations and the Electric Utility Results of Operations sections within this MD&A.\nRegulatory Proceedings\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding regulatory proceedings.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of recently issued accounting standards.\nWolf Creek Mid-Cycle Maintenance Outage and Refueling Outage\nWolf Creek's latest refueling outage began on February 28, 2015, and ended on May 3, 2015. Wolf Creek had a mid-cycle maintenance outage that began on March 8, 2014, and ended on May 13, 2014. Wolf Creek's next refueling outage is planned to begin in the third quarter of 2016.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nSee Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding related party transactions.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on Great Plains\nEnergy's results of operations and financial position. Management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of Great Plains Energy's results of operations and financial position. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Great Plains Energy Board of Directors (Board).\nPensions\nGreat Plains Energy incurs significant costs in providing non-contributory defined pension benefits. The costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience.\nPension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, life expectancies, compensation levels and employment periods), earnings on plan assets, the level of contributions made to the plan, and plan amendments. In addition, pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.\nThe assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted-average of long-term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan. The assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation. These assumptions, updated annually at the measurement date, are based on management's best estimates and judgment; however, material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 0.5% increase or a 0.5% decrease in key actuarial assumptions. Each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on\n</td> <td>Impact on\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change in\n</td> <td>Benefit\n</td> <td>Pension\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial assumption\n</td> <td>Assumption\n</td> <td>Obligation\n</td> <td>Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(78.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPension expense for KCP&L and GMO is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the MPSC and KCC. The orders allow the difference between pension costs under GAAP and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds, as appropriate.\nIn 2015, Great Plains Energy's pension expense was $96.1 million under GAAP and $86.3 million for ratemaking. The impact on 2015 pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on GAAP pension costs. Under the Companies' rate agreements, any increase or decrease in GAAP pension expense would be deferred in a regulatory asset or liability for future ratemaking treatment. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for pensions.\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan. It is difficult to predict future pension costs, changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded under GAAP. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues. Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers.\nManagement regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in electric utility's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to electric utility; and changes in laws and regulations. If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations. Electric utility's continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules. In the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of electric utility's operations, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided. Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nImpairments of Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nLong-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under GAAP.\nAccounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test is a two step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the second step of the test is performed, consisting of assignment of the reporting unit's fair value to its assets and liabilities to determine an implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the impairment loss, if any, to be recognized in the financial statements. Great Plains Energy's regulated electric utility operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as they are included within the same operating segment and have similar economic characteristics.\nThe annual impairment test for the $169.0 million of GMO acquisition goodwill was conducted on September 1, 2015. Fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill; therefore, there was no impairment of goodwill.\nThe determination of fair value of the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques: an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using market multiples derived from the historical revenue, earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), net utility asset values and market prices of stock of peer companies. The results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit, which involves a significant amount of management judgment.\nThe discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions: estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows. Management determined the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the MPSC and KCC and after-tax cost of debt. Estimated future cash flows are based on Great Plains Energy's internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of return on equity, anticipated earnings/returns related to future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts. Management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events. Should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions\ndiffer significantly from the current assumptions, revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of Great Plains Energy's reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill.\nThe market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by management's selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit, as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock. Management determined an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry. Changes in results of peer companies, selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of Great Plains Energy's reporting unit.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses, capital losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities. This process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ. The Company records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nGREAT PLAINS ENERGY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes Great Plains Energy's comparative results of operations.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,502.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,568.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,446.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(421.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(489.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(539.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(187.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(253.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transmission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,804.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,751.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,727.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(943.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(910.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(868.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(330.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(306.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(289.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>530.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>534.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>569.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(199.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(188.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(198.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(122.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(129.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from equity investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings available for common shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>241.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Gross margin, as used by Great Plains Energy and KCP&L, is defined as operating revenues less fuel, purchased power and transmission. Expenses for fuel, purchased power and certain transmission costs, offset by wholesale sales margin, are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms, except for KCP&L's Missouri retail operations prior to September 29, 2015, when a cost adjustment mechanism was approved. As a result, operating revenues increase or decrease in relation to a significant portion of these expenses. Management believes that gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating electric utility's operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board. The Companies' definition of gross margin may differ from similar terms used by other companies.\nELECTRIC UTILITY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes the electric utility segment results of operations.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,502.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,568.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,446.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(421.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(489.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(539.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(187.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(253.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transmission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,804.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,751.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,727.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(940.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(906.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(865.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(330.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(306.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(289.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>533.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>538.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>572.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(190.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(183.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(190.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(120.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(135.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Great Plains Energy's ability to make payments on its debt securities and its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries, proceeds from the issuance of its securities and borrowing under its revolving credit facility.\nGreat Plains Energy's capital requirements are principally comprised of debt maturities and electric utility's construction and other capital expenditures. These items as well as additional cash and capital requirements are discussed below.\nGreat Plains Energy's liquid resources at December 31, 2015, consisted of $11.3 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $1,010.6 million of available borrowing capacity from unused bank lines of credit and receivable sale agreements. The available borrowing capacity consisted of $189.8 million from Great Plains Energy's revolving credit facility, $417.0 million from KCP&L's credit facilities and $403.8 million from GMO's credit facilities. See Notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the receivable sale agreements and revolving credit facilities, respectively. Generally, Great Plains Energy uses these liquid resources to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements, and from time to time issues equity and/or long-term debt to repay short-term debt or increase cash balances.\nGreat Plains Energy intends to meet day-to-day cash flow requirements including interest payments, retirement of maturing debt, construction requirements, dividends and pension benefit plan funding requirements with a combination of internally generated funds and proceeds from short-term debt. From time to time, Great Plains Energy issues equity and/or long-term debt to repay short-term debt or increase cash balances. Great Plains Energy's intention to meet a portion of these requirements with internally generated funds may be impacted by the effect of inflation on operating expenses, the level of MWh sales, regulatory actions, compliance with environmental regulations and the availability of generating units. In addition, Great Plains Energy may issue equity, equity-linked securities and/or debt to finance growth.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nGreat Plains Energy generated positive cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented. The $54.9 million increase in cash flows from operating activities for Great Plains Energy in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $34.2 million increase driven by a decrease in solar rebates paid to customers and an increase in the recovery of costs subject to fuel recovery mechanisms of $76.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in net income of $29.8 million and a decrease driven by deferred refueling outage costs of $23.7 million. Other changes in working capital are detailed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The individual components of working capital vary with normal business cycles and operations.\nThe $78.6 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities for Great Plains Energy in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a $32.4 million decrease driven by changes in coal inventory levels, a $27.2 million decrease driven by the under recovery of costs subject to fuel recovery mechanisms where deferrals have exceeded recoveries and a $10.7 million decrease driven by an increase in solar rebates paid to customers.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nGreat Plains Energy's cash used for investing activities varies with the timing of utility capital expenditures and purchases of investments and nonutility property. Investing activities are offset by proceeds from the sale of properties and insurance recoveries.\nGreat Plains Energy's utility capital expenditures decreased $96.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in cash utility capital expenditures related to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station.\nGreat Plains Energy's utility capital expenditures increased $104.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in cash utility capital expenditures related to infrastructure and system improvements at KCP&L offset by a decrease in expenditures related to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station.\nIn January 2014, KCP&L and GMO completed the sale of two SPP-approved regional transmission projects, at cost, to Transource Missouri, LLC for cash proceeds of $37.7 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nGreat Plains Energy's cash flows from financing activities in 2015 reflect KCP&L's issuance, at a discount, of $350.0 million of 3.65% Senior Notes that mature in 2025, with the proceeds used to purchase in lieu of redemption $71.9 million of EIRR bonds and repay short-term borrowings.\nGreat Plains Energy's cash flows from financing activities in 2014 reflect increased short-term borrowings at KCP&L primarily driven by capital expenditures and pension funding contributions.\nGreat Plains Energy's cash flows from financing activities in 2013 reflect KCP&L's issuance, at a discount, of $300.0 million of 3.15% Senior Notes that mature in 2023 and the remarketing of $112.8 million of EIRR bonds previously held by KCP&L, with the proceeds used to repay short-term borrowings. In August 2013, GMO issued$350.0 million of senior notes and used the proceeds to repay a $248.7 million intercompany loan from Great Plains Energy and repay short-term borrowings. Great Plains Energy used the proceeds from GMO to repay its $250.0 million 2.75% Senior Notes that matured in August 2013.\nImpact of Credit Ratings on Liquidity\nThe ratings of Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's securities by the credit rating agencies impact their liquidity, including the cost of borrowings under their revolving credit agreements and in the capital markets. The Companies view maintenance of strong credit ratings as extremely important to their access to and cost of debt financing and to that end maintain an active and ongoing dialogue with the agencies with respect to results of operations, financial position and future prospects. While a decrease in these credit ratings would not cause any acceleration of Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's or GMO's debt, it could increase interest charges under Great Plains Energy's 6.875% Senior Notes due 2017 or Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's revolving credit agreements. A decrease in credit ratings could also have, among other things, an adverse impact, which could be material, on Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's access to capital, the cost of funds, the ability to recover actual interest costs in state regulatory proceedings, the type and amounts of collateral required under supply agreements and Great Plains Energy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries.\nAs of February 24, 2016, the major credit rating agencies rated Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's securities as detailed in the following table.\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Standard\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Investors Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>& Poor's\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Great Plains Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Credit Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred Stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KCP&L\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Secured Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.\nFinancing Authorization\nUnder stipulations with the MPSC and KCC, Great Plains Energy and KCP&L maintain common equity at not less than 30% and 35%, respectively, of total capitalization (including only the amount of short-term debt in excess of the amount of construction work in progress). KCP&L's long-term financing activities are subject to the authorization of the MPSC. In July 2014, the MPSC authorized KCP&L to issue up to $350.0 million of long-term debt and enter into interest rate hedging instruments in connection with such debt through June 30, 2016. At December 31, 2015, KCP&L had utilized all of this authorization.\nKCP&L's and GMO's short-term financing activities are subject to the authorization of FERC. In November 2014, FERC authorized KCP&L to have outstanding at any one time up to a total of $1.0 billion in short-term debt instruments through December 2016. At December 31, 2015 there was $819.7 million available under this authorization. In January 2014, FERC authorized GMO to have outstanding at any one time up to a total of $750.0 million in short-term debt instruments through March 2016. At December 31, 2015, there was $706.3 million available under this authorization.\nKCP&L and GMO are also authorized by FERC to participate in the Great Plains Energy money pool, an internal financing arrangement in which funds may be lent on a short-term basis to KCP&L and GMO. At December 31, 2015, GMO had an outstanding payable to Great Plains Energy under the money pool of $3.7 million.\nSignificant Financing Activities\nGreat Plains Energy\nGreat Plains Energy has an effective shelf registration statement for the sale of unlimited amounts of securities with the SEC that was filed and became effective in March 2015 and expires in March 2018.\nIn August 2013, GMO entered into a note purchase agreement and issued the following series of unsecured senior notes:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$125.0 million 3.49% Senior Notes, Series A, maturing in 2025;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$75.0 million 4.06% Senior Notes, Series B, maturing in 2033; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$150.0 million 4.74% Senior Notes, Series C, maturing in 2043.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> KCP&L\nKCP&L has an effective shelf registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of notes and general mortgage bonds with the SEC that was filed and became effective in March 2015 and expires in March 2018.\nIn August 2015, KCP&L issued, at a discount, $350.0 million of 3.65% unsecured Senior Notes, maturing in 2025.\nIn March 2013, KCP&L issued, at a discount, $300.0 million of 3.15% unsecured Senior Notes, maturing in 2023.\nIn April 2013, KCP&L remarketed the following series of EIRR bonds that were previously held by KCP&L:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>secured Series 1993B EIRR bonds totaling $39.5 million at a fixed rate of 2.95% through maturity; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unsecured Series 2007A-1 and 2007A-2 EIRR bonds totaling $10.0 million and $63.3 million, respectively, maturing in 2035 into one series: Series 2007A totaling $73.3 million at a variable rate that will be determined weekly.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Debt Agreements\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding revolving credit facilities.\nProjected Utility Capital Expenditures\nGreat Plains Energy's cash utility capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC to finance construction, were $677.1 million, $773.7 million and $669.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Utility capital expenditures represent a significant portion of Great Plains Energy's capital requirements. Utility capital expenditures projected for the next five years include improvements to generating, distribution and transmission facilities, software upgrades and expenditures for environmental projects at coal-fired power plants. Great Plains Energy intends to meet these capital requirements with a combination of internally generated funds and proceeds from short-term and long-term debt.\nUtility capital expenditures projected for the next five years, excluding AFUDC, are detailed in the following table. This utility capital expenditure plan is subject to continual review and change.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Generating facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution and transmission facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>216.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nuclear fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total utility capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>680.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>580.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>540.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>573.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>667.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPensions\nThe Company incurs significant costs in providing defined benefit plans for substantially all active and inactive employees of KCP&L and GMO and its 47% ownership share of WCNOC's defined benefit plans. Funding of the plans follows legal and regulatory requirements with funding equaling or exceeding the minimum requirements of employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).\nIn 2015 and 2014, the Company contributed $76.9 million and $66.2 million to the pension plans, respectively, and expects to contribute $75.7 million in 2016 to satisfy the minimum ERISA funding requirements and the MPSC and KCC rate orders, the majority of which is expected to be paid by KCP&L. Additional contributions to the plans are\nexpected beyond 2016 in amounts at least sufficient to meet the greater of ERISA or regulatory funding requirements; however, these amounts have not yet been determined.\nAdditionally, the Company provides post-retirement health and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees and expects to make benefit contributions of $5.1 million under the provisions of these plans in 2016, the majority of which is expected to be paid by KCP&L.\nManagement believes the Company has adequate access to capital resources through cash flows from operations or through existing lines of credit to support these funding requirements.\nSupplemental Capital Requirements and Liquidity Information\nThe information in the following table is provided to summarize

Power commitments consist of commitments for renewable energy under power purchase agreements. KCP&L and GMO purchase capacity from other utilities and nonutility suppliers. Purchasing capacity provides the option to purchase energy if needed or when market prices are favorable. KCP&L has capacity sales agreements not included above that total $6.0 million, $1.9 million, $2.1 million, $1.9 million and $2.0 million per year from 2016 to 2020. Non-regulated natural gas transportation consists of MPS Merchant's commitments.

Such agreements include, for example, guarantees and letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiary's intended business purposes. The majority of these agreements guarantee the Company's own future performance, so a liability for the fair value of the obligation is not recorded.\nAt December 31, 2015, Great Plains Energy has provided $138.4 million of credit support for GMO as follows:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Great Plains Energy direct guarantees to GMO counterparties totaling $40.7 million, which expire in 2016 and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Great Plains Energy guarantees of GMO long-term debt totaling $97.7 million, which includes debt with maturity dates ranging from 2016 to 2023.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Great Plains Energy has also guaranteed GMO's commercial paper program.

consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using market multiples derived from the historical revenue, earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), net utility asset values and market prices of stock of peer companies. The results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit, which involves a significant amount of management judgment.\nThe Company has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded under GAAP.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n (a) Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See explanation of gross margin below.  2015 Compared to 2014\nElectric utility's gross margin increased $53.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:\n\n \u2022 $75.0 million 4.06% Senior Notes, Series B, maturing in 2033; and \nKCP&L Non-Operating Income and Expenses\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nAt December 31, 2015, KCP&L had issued letters of credit totaling $23.5 million as credit support to certain counterparties that expire in 2016. KCP&L has issued $148.1 million of letters of credit as credit support for its variable rate EIRR Bond Series 2007A and B that expire in 2018.\n \u2022 a $16.0 million increase from energy efficiency programs under MEEIA consisting of $12.4 million for recovery of program costs, which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense, and $3.6 million for recovery of throughput disincentive; and \n \u2022 a $7.9 million increase in interest charges primarily due to a $7.2 million decrease in the debt component of AFUDC; and \nGreat Plains Energy's sole reportable business segment is electric utility. Electric utility consists of KCP&L, a regulated utility, GMO's regulated utility operations, which include its Missouri Public Service and St. Joseph Light & Power divisions, and GMO Receivables Company. Electric utility has approximately 6,400 MWs of owned generating capacity and engages in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 846,100 customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas. Electric utility's retail electricity rates are comparable to the national average of investor-owned utilities.\nGREAT PLAINS ENERGY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGreat Plains Energy\n \u2022 a $9.8 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to decreased pre-tax income.  Great Plains Energy's corporate and other activities loss decreased $6.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the release of uncertain tax positions related to former GMO non-regulated operations in the third quarter of 2014 which resulted in:\n \u2022 a $16.0 million increase from energy efficiency programs under MEEIA consisting of $12.4 million for recovery of program costs, which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense, and $3.6 million for recovery of throughput disincentive; and \nSee Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters.\n \u2022 a $2.3 million decrease in borrowing costs for short-term debt primarily driven by lower average commercial paper balances and interest rates in 2014 at GMO, as well as lower borrowing fees under KCP&L's and GMO's revolving credit facilities in 2014; and \nexpected beyond 2016 in amounts at least sufficient to meet the greater of ERISA or regulatory funding requirements; however, these amounts have not yet been determined.\n \u2022 an estimated $36 million increase due to new retail rates for KCP&L in Missouri effective September 29, 2015, and in Kansas effective July 25, 2014 and October 1, 2015; \n \u2022 a $10.4 million increase in general taxes due to increased property taxes. \nThe following table summarizes KCP&L's gross margin and MWhs sold.\nElectric Utility Depreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 an $11.8 million decrease in non-operating income and expenses driven by a $13.2 million decrease in the equity component of AFUDC primarily due to a lower average construction work in progress in 2015 due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service; \nKCP&L's other operating expenses increased $11.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $2.3 million decrease in borrowing costs for short-term debt primarily driven by lower average commercial paper balances and interest rates in 2014 at GMO, as well as lower borrowing fees under KCP&L's and GMO's revolving credit facilities in 2014; and \nA securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.\n \u2022 a $24.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to capital additions; \nFuel commitments consist of commitments for nuclear fuel, coal and coal transportation costs. Power commitments consist of commitments for renewable energy under power purchase agreements. KCP&L and GMO purchase capacity from other utilities and nonutility suppliers. Purchasing capacity provides the option to purchase energy if needed or when market prices are favorable. KCP&L has capacity sales agreements not included above that total $6.0 million, $1.9 million, $2.1 million, $1.9 million and $2.0 million per year from 2016 to 2020. Non-regulated natural gas transportation consists of MPS Merchant's commitments. Other represents individual commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nIncome Taxes\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 an $8.7 million increase in general taxes driven by higher property taxes; and \n \u2022 a $22.9 million increase in utility operating and maintenance expenses primarily driven by an increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA and amortization of deferred renewable energy costs under RESRAM, both of which have a direct offset in revenue, partially offset by a decrease in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to decreased refueling outage amortization and a planned mid-cycle maintenance outage in 2014; \nGreat Plains Energy's 2015 earnings available for common shareholders decreased to $211.4 million or $1.37 per share from $241.2 million or $1.57 per share in 2014 driven by:\nElectric Utility Gross Margin and MWh Sales\nKCP&L Interest Charges\nDescription of Business\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nGreat Plains Energy's cash flows from financing activities in 2013 reflect KCP&L's issuance, at a discount, of $300.0 million of 3.15% Senior Notes that mature in 2023 and the remarketing of $112.8 million of EIRR bonds previously held by KCP&L, with the proceeds used to repay short-term borrowings. In August 2013, GMO issued$350.0 million of senior notes and used the proceeds to repay a $248.7 million intercompany loan from Great Plains Energy and repay short-term borrowings. Great Plains Energy used the proceeds from GMO to repay its $250.0 million 2.75% Senior Notes that matured in August 2013.\n \u2022 an $8.3 million increase in transmission and distribution operating and maintenance expenses; and \nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of recently issued accounting standards.\n \u2022 an estimated $9 million decrease due to higher transmission expense; and \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on Great Plains\nThe Company incurs significant costs in providing defined benefit plans for substantially all active and inactive employees of KCP&L and GMO and its 47% ownership share of WCNOC's defined benefit plans. Funding of the plans follows legal and regulatory requirements with funding equaling or exceeding the minimum requirements of employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).\nUtility capital expenditures projected for the next five years, excluding AFUDC, are detailed in the following table. This utility capital expenditure plan is subject to continual review and change.\nGross Margin\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan. It is difficult to predict future pension costs, changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 0.5% increase or a 0.5% decrease in key actuarial assumptions. Each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n2015 Earnings Overview\nThe discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions: estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows. Management determined the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the MPSC and KCC and after-tax cost of debt. Estimated future cash flows are based on Great Plains Energy's internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of return on equity, anticipated earnings/returns related to future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts. Management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events. Should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions\n \u2022 a $7.0 million increase in income tax expense primarily driven by income tax benefits in 2014 related to the release of uncertain tax positions partially offset by decreased pre-tax income.  Gross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). See the explanation of gross margin and the reconciliation to GAAP operating revenues under Great Plains Energy's Results of Operations for further information.\n \u2022 an estimated $16 million increase in other margin items including a change in customer mix, lower fuel and purchased power expenses that are not included in fuel recovery mechanisms and an increase in transmission costs recovered through the transmission delivery charge rider that began in the fourth quarter of 2015; \n (a) Consists of recovery of program costs of $20.5 million and $6.3 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, that have a direct offset in operating and maintenance expenses and recovery of throughput disincentive of $7.0 million and $2.9 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. \nIn the ordinary course of business, Great Plains Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include, for example, guarantees and letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiary's intended business purposes. The majority of these agreements guarantee the Company's own future performance, so a liability for the fair value of the obligation is not recorded.\nGreat Plains Energy operates through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Great Plains Energy's ability to make payments on its debt securities and its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries, proceeds from the issuance of its securities and borrowing under its revolving credit facility.\nGreat Plains Energy is a public utility holding company and does not own or operate any significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries.\n \u2022 a $1.2 million increase in the debt component of AFUDC resulting from a higher average construction work in progress balance in 2014 primarily due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station.  Electric Utility Income Tax Expense\n \u2022 a $7.2 million increase for recovery of renewable energy costs under RESRAM, which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense; \n \u2022 a $14.2 million increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in revenue, primarily due to the implementation of KCP&L's MEEIA programs in August 2014; \n \u2022 a $6.0 million increase in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses due to $8.7 million from a planned mid-cycle outage that began in March 2014 and concluded in May 2014, increased amortization of $3.4 million from a planned refueling outage that began in February 2013 and ended in April 2013, where costs are deferred and amortized between refueling outages, partially offset by $6.1 million of other decreases in operating and maintenance expenses; \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe following tables summarize electric utility's gross margin and MWhs sold.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nKCP&L's gross margin increased $47.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $6.0 million increase in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses due to $8.7 million from a planned mid-cycle outage that began in March 2014 and concluded in May 2014, increased amortization of $3.4 million from a planned refueling outage that began in February 2013 and ended in April 2013, where costs are deferred and amortized between refueling outages, partially offset by $6.1 million of other decreases in operating and maintenance expenses; \n \u2022 an estimated $6 million increase from weather-normalized retail demand; \nThe following table summarizes the electric utility segment results of operations.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses, capital losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities. This process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ. The Company records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n \u2022 a $7.2 million increase in amortization of deferred renewable energy costs under RESRAM, which have a direct offset in revenue; \n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's deferred income taxes - current asset decreased $78.1 million due to the adoption of ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. \n \u2022 secured Series 1993B EIRR bonds totaling $39.5 million at a fixed rate of 2.95% through maturity; and \n\n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's net utility plant in service increased $945.8 million and construction work in progress decreased $552.1 million primarily due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service. \n \u2022 GMO's electric retail rates contain a FAC tariff under which 95% of the difference between actual fuel cost, purchased power costs, certain transmission costs and off-system sales margin and the amount provided in base rates for these costs is passed along to GMO's customers. The FAC cycle consists of an accumulation period of six months beginning in June and December with FAC rate approval requested every six months for a twelve month recovery period. The FAC is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to GMO's electric retail customers. \n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's long-term debt increased $279.4 million due to the August 2015 issuance, at a discount, of KCP&L's $350.0 million of 3.65% Senior Notes partially offset by the September 2015 purchase in lieu of redemption of $71.9 million of KCP&L's EIRR bonds.  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIQUIDITY\n \u2022 an $8.6 million increase in general taxes driven by higher property taxes; \n (a) Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See explanation of gross margin under Great Plains Energy's Results of Operations.  KCP&L Gross Margin and MWh Sales\n \u2022 KCP&L's Kansas retail rates contain an Energy Cost Adjustment (ECA) tariff. The ECA tariff reflects the projected annual amounts of fuel, purchased power, emission allowances and asset-based off-system sales margin. These projected amounts are subject to quarterly re-forecasts. Any difference between the ECA revenue collected and the actual ECA amounts for a given year (which may be positive or negative) is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to Kansas retail customers over twelve months beginning April 1 of the succeeding year. \n \u2022 a $10.4 million increase in general taxes due to increased property taxes; \n\n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's asset retirement obligations increased $80.0 million primarily due to new asset retirement obligations related to CCR regulations. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n \u2022 an estimated $20 million increase in other margin items including a change in customer mix, lower fuel and purchased power expenses that are not included in fuel recovery mechanisms and an increase in transmission costs recovered through the transmission delivery charge rider that began in the fourth quarter of 2015; \n \u2022 a $22.2 million increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in revenue, primarily due to the implementation of KCP&L's MEEIA programs in August 2014; \nGreat Plains Energy's cash utility capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC to finance construction, were $677.1 million, $773.7 million and $669.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Utility capital expenditures represent a significant portion of Great Plains Energy's capital requirements. Utility capital expenditures projected for the next five years include improvements to generating, distribution and transmission facilities, software upgrades and expenditures for environmental projects at coal-fired power plants. Great Plains Energy intends to meet these capital requirements with a combination of internally generated funds and proceeds from short-term and long-term debt.\n \u2022 an estimated $20 million increase in other margin items including a change in customer mix, lower fuel and purchased power expenses that are not included in fuel recovery mechanisms and an increase in transmission costs recovered through the transmission delivery charge rider that began in the fourth quarter of 2015; \n \u2022 an estimated $36 million increase due to new retail rates for KCP&L in Missouri effective September 29, 2015, and in Kansas effective July 25, 2014 and October 1, 2015; \nGreat Plains Energy's cash used for investing activities varies with the timing of utility capital expenditures and purchases of investments and nonutility property. Investing activities are offset by proceeds from the sale of properties and insurance recoveries.\noperating and maintenance expense. The projected amounts are subject to an annual true-up with a twelve month recovery period. The TDC is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to KCP&L's Kansas electric retail customers. The TDC became effective in conjunction with new retail rates on October 1, 2015.\n \u2022 a $22.2 million increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in revenue, primarily due to the implementation of KCP&L's MEEIA programs in August 2014; \nRegulatory Proceedings\nGreat Plains Energy's liquid resources at December 31, 2015, consisted of $11.3 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $1,010.6 million of available borrowing capacity from unused bank lines of credit and receivable sale agreements. The available borrowing capacity consisted of $189.8 million from Great Plains Energy's revolving credit facility, $417.0 million from KCP&L's credit facilities and $403.8 million from GMO's credit facilities. See Notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the receivable sale agreements and revolving credit facilities, respectively. Generally, Great Plains Energy uses these liquid resources to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements, and from time to time issues equity and/or long-term debt to repay short-term debt or increase cash balances.\nAccounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test is a two step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the second step of the test is performed, consisting of assignment of the reporting unit's fair value to its assets and liabilities to determine an implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the impairment loss, if any, to be recognized in the financial statements. Great Plains Energy's regulated electric utility operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as they are included within the same operating segment and have similar economic characteristics.\n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's fuel inventories, at average cost increased $28.3 million primarily due to an increase in coal inventories primarily due to coal plant maintenance outages. \n \u2022 a $22.2 million increase for recovery of program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense, primarily due to the implementation of KCP&L's MEEIA programs in August 2014; \n \u2022 an estimated $6 million increase from weather-normalized retail demand; \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \u2022 an estimated $6 million increase from weather-normalized retail demand; \nGreat Plains Energy's utility capital expenditures increased $104.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in cash utility capital expenditures related to infrastructure and system improvements at KCP&L offset by a decrease in expenditures related to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station.\n (b) Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See explanation of gross margin under Great Plains Energy's Results of Operations. \n \u2022 a $53.4 million increase in gross margin driven by new retail rates, an increase in weather-normalized retail demand, recovery of program costs for energy efficiency programs under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (MEEIA) and recovery of renewable energy costs under the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard Rate Adjustment Mechanism (RESRAM), both of which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense; partially offset by milder weather; \nKCP&L's interest charges increased $11.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a decrease in the debt component of AFUDC primarily due to a lower average construction work in progress in 2015 due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service.\n \u2022 an estimated $15 million decrease due to weather driven by a 19% decrease in heating degree days in 2015 and a 15% decrease in cooling degree days in the second quarter of 2015 partially offset by an 18% increase in cooling degree days in the third quarter of 2015.  KCP&L Other Operating Expenses (including operating and maintenance expenses, general taxes and other)\nElectric utility's non-operating income and expenses decreased $11.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a $13.2 million decrease in the equity component of AFUDC primarily due to a lower average construction work in progress in 2015 due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 a $40.8 million increase in other operating expenses primarily due to: \n \u2022 an $8.7 million increase in general taxes driven by higher property taxes; and \nElectric utility's income tax expense decreased $4.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to decreased pre-tax income. Electric utility's income tax expense decreased $9.8 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreased pre-tax income.\nElectric Utility Other Operating Expenses (including utility operating and maintenance expenses, general taxes and other)\nGREAT PLAINS ENERGY SIGNIFICANT BALANCE SHEET CHANGES\n \u2022 an estimated $4 million decrease due to unfavorable weather driven by a 6% decrease in cooling degree days; \n \u2022 an estimated $24 million decrease due to weather driven by a 19% decrease in heating degree days in 2015 and a 15% decrease in cooling degree days in the second quarter of 2015 partially offset by an 18% increase in cooling degree days in the third quarter of 2015.  Electric utility's gross margin increased $23.3 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to:\nThe $78.6 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities for Great Plains Energy in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a $32.4 million decrease driven by changes in coal inventory levels, a $27.2 million decrease driven by the under recovery of costs subject to fuel recovery mechanisms where deferrals have exceeded recoveries and a $10.7 million decrease driven by an increase in solar rebates paid to customers.\n \u2022 a $10.8 million increase in interest charges primarily due to lower interest expense in 2014 related to the release of uncertain tax positions and a decrease in the debt component of AFUDC; and \n \u2022 unsecured Series 2007A-1 and 2007A-2 EIRR bonds totaling $10.0 million and $63.3 million, respectively, maturing in 2035 into one series: Series 2007A totaling $73.3 million at a variable rate that will be determined weekly.  Debt Agreements\nElectric utility's residential customers' usage is significantly affected by weather. Bulk power sales, the major component of wholesale sales, vary with system requirements, generating unit availability, transmission availability, fuel costs, and requirements of other electric systems. Electric utility's revenues contain certain recovery mechanisms as follows:\nElectric utility's other operating expenses increased $33.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:\n(December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014)\nGreat Plains Energy has an effective shelf registration statement for the sale of unlimited amounts of securities with the SEC that was filed and became effective in March 2015 and expires in March 2018.\nELECTRIC UTILITY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn January 2014, KCP&L and GMO completed the sale of two SPP-approved regional transmission projects, at cost, to Transource Missouri, LLC for cash proceeds of $37.7 million.\nWolf Creek's latest refueling outage began on February 28, 2015, and ended on May 3, 2015. Wolf Creek had a mid-cycle maintenance outage that began on March 8, 2014, and ended on May 13, 2014. Wolf Creek's next refueling outage is planned to begin in the third quarter of 2016.\nGreat Plains Energy's 2014 earnings available for common shareholders decreased to $241.2 million or $1.57 per share from $248.6 million or $1.62 per share in 2013.\n \u2022 an estimated $5 million decrease due to higher transmission expense; \nIn April 2013, KCP&L remarketed the following series of EIRR bonds that were previously held by KCP&L:\n \u2022 an estimated $24 million decrease due to weather driven by a 19% decrease in heating degree days in 2015 and a 15% decrease in cooling degree days in the second quarter of 2015 partially offset by an 18% increase in cooling degree days in the third quarter of 2015. \nGreat Plains Energy's cash flows from financing activities in 2014 reflect increased short-term borrowings at KCP&L primarily driven by capital expenditures and pension funding contributions.\n\n \u2022 $150.0 million 4.74% Senior Notes, Series C, maturing in 2043.  KCP&L\nThe assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted-average of long-term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan. The assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation. These assumptions, updated annually at the measurement date, are based on management's best estimates and judgment; however, material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs.\nSupplemental Capital Requirements and Liquidity Information\nElectric Utility Interest Charges\nAs of February 24, 2016, the major credit rating agencies rated Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's securities as detailed in the following table.\n \u2022 a $7.2 million increase for recovery of renewable energy costs under RESRAM, which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense; \nElectric utility's depreciation and amortization expense increased $24.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to capital additions. Electric utility's depreciation and amortization expense increased $16.3 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to capital additions.\nGreat Plains Energy incurs significant costs in providing non-contributory defined pension benefits. The costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience.\nElectric utility's net income decreased $19.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:\nAt December 31, 2015, Great Plains Energy has provided $138.4 million of credit support for GMO as follows:\n \u2022 a $10.0 million decrease in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to decreased refueling outage amortization of $3.6 million and $8.7 million from a planned mid-cycle maintenance outage in 2014.  Electric utility's other operating expenses increased $40.8 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to:\nGreat Plains Energy generated positive cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented. The $54.9 million increase in cash flows from operating activities for Great Plains Energy in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $34.2 million increase driven by a decrease in solar rebates paid to customers and an increase in the recovery of costs subject to fuel recovery mechanisms of $76.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in net income of $29.8 million and a decrease driven by deferred refueling outage costs of $23.7 million. Other changes in working capital are detailed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The individual components of working capital vary with normal business cycles and operations.\nThe market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by management's selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit, as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock. Management determined an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry. Changes in results of peer companies, selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of Great Plains Energy's reporting unit.\n\u2022$6.1 million of income tax benefits in 2014.\n \u2022 an estimated $19 million decrease due to lower wholesale margins partially offset by an estimated $14 million due to lower fuel and purchased power expense at KCP&L in Missouri, where there was no fuel recovery mechanism prior to September 29, 2015; \nLease commitments end in 2048. Operating lease commitments include railcars to serve jointly-owned generating units where KCP&L is the managing partner. Of the amounts included in the table above, KCP&L will be reimbursed by the other owners for approximately $1.5 million in 2016, $0.9 million in 2017 and approximately $0.4 million per year from 2018 to 2025, for a total of $6.0 million.\nImpact of Credit Ratings on Liquidity\n \u2022 an $8.3 million increase in transmission and distribution operating and maintenance expenses; and \nGreat Plains Energy's capital requirements are principally comprised of debt maturities and electric utility's construction and other capital expenditures. These items as well as additional cash and capital requirements are discussed below.\n \u2022 a $1.2 million increase in the debt component of AFUDC resulting from a higher average construction work in progress balance in 2014 primarily due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station; and \n \u2022 GMO's steam rates contain a Quarterly Cost Adjustment (QCA) under which 85% of the difference between actual fuel costs and base fuel costs is passed along to GMO's steam customers. The QCA is recorded as an increase to or reduction of other revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to GMO's steam customers.  Both KCP&L and GMO offer energy efficiency and demand side management programs to their Missouri retail customers under MEEIA and recover both program costs and throughput disincentive in retail rates. KCP&L recovers these items through a rider mechanism, with the difference between the amount collected and the actual program costs and throughput disincentive recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to KCP&L's Missouri retail customers. GMO recovers these items through base rates, with the difference between the amount collected and the actual program costs and throughput disincentive to be included as part of future GMO rate case proceedings.\n \u2022 a $14.2 million increase for recovery of program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in operating and maintenance expense, due to the implementation of KCP&L's MEEIA programs in August 2014; \n\n (b) Consists of recovery of program costs of $42.9 million, $20.7 million and $8.3 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, that have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expenses and recovery of throughput disincentive of $8.6 million, $7.8 million and $4.2 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n \u2022 a $24.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense driven by capital additions; \nManagement regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in electric utility's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to electric utility; and changes in laws and regulations. If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations. Electric utility's continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules. In the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of electric utility's operations, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided. Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nProjected Utility Capital Expenditures\nGreat Plains Energy has other insignificant long-term liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, which do not have a definitive cash payout date and are not included in the table above.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nGreat Plains Energy's cash flows from financing activities in 2015 reflect KCP&L's issuance, at a discount, of $350.0 million of 3.65% Senior Notes that mature in 2025, with the proceeds used to purchase in lieu of redemption $71.9 million of EIRR bonds and repay short-term borrowings.\nEnergy's results of operations and financial position. Management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of Great Plains Energy's results of operations and financial position. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Great Plains Energy Board of Directors (Board).\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding revolving credit facilities.\n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's commercial paper decreased $134.3 million primarily due to repayment with a portion of the proceeds from KCP&L's August 2015 issuance of $350.0 million of 3.65% Senior Notes partially offset by additional borrowings for general corporate purposes. \n (a) Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See explanation of gross margin under Great Plains Energy's Results of Operations. \nPensions\n \u2022 Great Plains Energy direct guarantees to GMO counterparties totaling $40.7 million, which expire in 2016 and \nThe Company expects to contribute $80.8 million to the pension and other post-retirement plans in 2016, of which the majority is expected to be paid by KCP&L. Additional contributions to the plans are expected beyond 2020 in amounts at least sufficient to meet the greater of ERISA or regulatory funding requirements; however, these amounts have not yet been determined. Amounts for years after 2016 are estimates based on information available in determining the amount for 2016. Actual amounts for years after 2016 could be significantly different than the estimated amounts in the table above.\nElectric utility's net income decreased $13.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to:\nFor additional information regarding the change in earnings, refer to the Great Plains Energy Results of Operations and the Electric Utility Results of Operations sections within this MD&A.\n \u2022 a $2.1 million decrease in after-tax interest expense; and \nIn 2015 and 2014, the Company contributed $76.9 million and $66.2 million to the pension plans, respectively, and expects to contribute $75.7 million in 2016 to satisfy the minimum ERISA funding requirements and the MPSC and KCC rate orders, the majority of which is expected to be paid by KCP&L. Additional contributions to the plans are\nPension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, life expectancies, compensation levels and employment periods), earnings on plan assets, the level of contributions made to the plan, and plan amendments. In addition, pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.\n \u2022 a $1.6 million decrease from the remarketing of KCP&L's Series 1992, 1993A, 2007B EIRR bonds in April 2013 and Series 2008 EIRR bonds in July 2013 at lower interest rates; \nKCP&L's depreciation and amortization expense increased $21.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to capital additions.\n\n \u2022 a $53.4 million increase in gross margin driven by: \nElectric Utility Non-Operating Income and Expenses\n \u2022 a $4.8 million decrease in income tax expense primarily driven by decreased pre-tax income.  Great Plains Energy's corporate and other activities loss increased $10.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the release of uncertain tax positions related to former GMO non-regulated operations in the third quarter of 2014 which resulted in:\nKCP&L has an effective shelf registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of notes and general mortgage bonds with the SEC that was filed and became effective in March 2015 and expires in March 2018.\n \u2022 an estimated $14 million increase from new retail rates in Missouri effective January 26, 2013 and in Kansas effective July 25, 2014; \nPension expense for KCP&L and GMO is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the MPSC and KCC. The orders allow the difference between pension costs under GAAP and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds, as appropriate.\nPensions\nIn 2015, Great Plains Energy's pension expense was $96.1 million under GAAP and $86.3 million for ratemaking. The impact on 2015 pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on GAAP pension costs. Under the Companies' rate agreements, any increase or decrease in GAAP pension expense would be deferred in a regulatory asset or liability for future ratemaking treatment. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for pensions.\nThe following table summarizes KCP&L's consolidated comparative results of operations.\n \u2022 an estimated $36 million increase due to new retail rates for KCP&L in Missouri effective September 29, 2015, and in Kansas effective July 25, 2014 and October 1, 2015; \nGreat Plains Energy intends to meet day-to-day cash flow requirements including interest payments, retirement of maturing debt, construction requirements, dividends and pension benefit plan funding requirements with a combination of internally generated funds and proceeds from short-term debt. From time to time, Great Plains Energy issues equity and/or long-term debt to repay short-term debt or increase cash balances. Great Plains Energy's intention to meet a portion of these requirements with internally generated funds may be impacted by the effect of inflation on operating expenses, the level of MWh sales, regulatory actions, compliance with environmental regulations and the availability of generating units. In addition, Great Plains Energy may issue equity, equity-linked securities and/or debt to finance growth.\n \u2022 an estimated $4 million decrease due to unfavorable weather driven by a 6% decrease in cooling degree days.  The following table provides cooling degree days (CDD) and heating degree days (HDD) for the last three years at the Kansas City International Airport. CDD and HDD are used to reflect the demand for energy to cool or heat homes and buildings.\n \u2022 a $10.0 million decrease in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to decreased refueling outage amortization of $3.6 million and $8.7 million from a planned mid-cycle maintenance outage in 2014.  KCP&L Depreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 an estimated $19 million decrease due to lower wholesale margins partially offset by an estimated $14 million due to lower fuel and purchased power expense at KCP&L in Missouri, where there was no fuel recovery mechanism prior to September 29, 2015; and \nGREAT PLAINS ENERGY INCORPORATED\nElectric utility's interest charges decreased $7.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to:\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding related party transactions.\nElectric utility's interest charges increased $7.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a $7.2 million decrease in in the equity component of AFUDC primarily due to a lower average construction work in progress in 2015 due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service.\n \u2022 a $16.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to capital additions; \n \u2022 a $12.4 million increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in revenue; \n\n \u2022 a $10.0 million decrease in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to decreased refueling outage amortization of $3.6 million and $8.7 million from a planned mid-cycle maintenance outage in 2014. \n \u2022 an estimated $19 million decrease due to lower wholesale margins partially offset by an estimated $14 million due to lower fuel and purchased power expense at KCP&L in Missouri, where there was no fuel recovery mechanism prior to September 29, 2015; \n (a) Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See explanation of gross margin under Great Plains Energy's Results of Operations. \n \u2022 KCP&L's Kansas retail rates contain a Transmission Delivery Charge (TDC) rider. The TDC tariff reflects a mixture of historical and projected costs related to retail transmission, certain RTO fees and transmission \nThe annual impairment test for the $169.0 million of GMO acquisition goodwill was conducted on September 1, 2015. Fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill; therefore, there was no impairment of goodwill.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \u2022 a $7.5 million decrease in interest expense primarily due to: \n \u2022 an estimated $9 million decrease due to higher transmission expense; and \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nKCP&L and GMO are also authorized by FERC to participate in the Great Plains Energy money pool, an internal financing arrangement in which funds may be lent on a short-term basis to KCP&L and GMO. At December 31, 2015, GMO had an outstanding payable to Great Plains Energy under the money pool of $3.7 million.\n \u2022 Great Plains Energy guarantees of GMO long-term debt totaling $97.7 million, which includes debt with maturity dates ranging from 2016 to 2023.  Great Plains Energy has also guaranteed GMO's commercial paper program. At December 31, 2015, GMO had $43.7 million commercial paper outstanding. None of the guaranteed obligations are subject to default or prepayment if GMO's credit ratings were downgraded.\n\u2022$2.1 million lower after-tax interest expense in 2014; and\nLong-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under GAAP.\n \u2022 a $33.8 million increase in other operating expenses primarily due to: \n\n (c) N/M - not meaningful \n (c) N/M - not meaningful \n \u2022 a $23.3 million increase in gross margin driven by: \nAdditionally, the Company provides post-retirement health and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees and expects to make benefit contributions of $5.1 million under the provisions of these plans in 2016, the majority of which is expected to be paid by KCP&L.\ndiffer significantly from the current assumptions, revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of Great Plains Energy's reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill.\n \u2022 a $7.2 million increase in amortization of deferred renewable energy costs under RESRAM, which have a direct offset in revenue; \nFinancing Authorization\n \u2022 a $12.4 million increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in revenue; \nThe ratings of Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's securities by the credit rating agencies impact their liquidity, including the cost of borrowings under their revolving credit agreements and in the capital markets. The Companies view maintenance of strong credit ratings as extremely important to their access to and cost of debt financing and to that end maintain an active and ongoing dialogue with the agencies with respect to results of operations, financial position and future prospects. While a decrease in these credit ratings would not cause any acceleration of Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's or GMO's debt, it could increase interest charges under Great Plains Energy's 6.875% Senior Notes due 2017 or Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's revolving credit agreements. A decrease in credit ratings could also have, among other things, an adverse impact, which could be material, on Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's access to capital, the cost of funds, the ability to recover actual interest costs in state regulatory proceedings, the type and amounts of collateral required under supply agreements and Great Plains Energy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries.\nKANSAS CITY POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nKCP&L's non-operating income and expenses decreased $10.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a decrease in the equity component of AFUDC primarily due to a lower average construction work in progress in 2015 due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service.\nWolf Creek Mid-Cycle Maintenance Outage and Refueling Outage\nGross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Gross margin, as used by Great Plains Energy and KCP&L, is defined as operating revenues less fuel, purchased power and transmission. Expenses for fuel, purchased power and certain transmission costs, offset by wholesale sales margin, are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms, except for KCP&L's Missouri retail operations prior to September 29, 2015, when a cost adjustment mechanism was approved. As a result, operating revenues increase or decrease in relation to a significant portion of these expenses. Management believes that gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating electric utility's operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board. The Companies' definition of gross margin may differ from similar terms used by other companies.\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding regulatory proceedings.\nManagement believes the Company has adequate access to capital resources through cash flows from operations or through existing lines of credit to support these funding requirements.\nImpairments of Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n \u2022 a $13.3 million decrease in non-operating income driven by a decrease in the equity component of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC); \n \u2022 KCP&L's Missouri retail rates contain a Fuel Adjustment Clause (FAC) tariff under which 95% of the difference between actual fuel cost, purchased power costs, certain transmission costs and off-system sales margin and the amount provided in base rates for these costs is passed along to KCP&L's customers. The FAC cycle consists of an accumulation period of six months beginning in January and July with FAC rate approval requested every six months for a twelve month recovery period. The FAC is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to KCP&L's electric retail customers. The FAC became effective in conjunction with new retail rates on September 29, 2015. \n\nThe information in the following table is provided to summarize Great Plains Energy's cash obligations and commercial commitments.", "item_7_text": " \u2022 Great Plains Energy's current maturities of long-term debt decreased $14.0 million due to the repayment of KCP&L's $14.0 million secured Series 2005 EIRR bonds at maturity in March 2015. \nSignificant Financing Activities\n (a) The Company expects to make contributions to the pension and other post-retirement plans beyond 2020 but the amounts are not yet determined. Amounts for years after 2016 are estimates based on information available in determining the amount for 2016. Actual amounts for years after 2016 could be significantly different than the estimated amounts in the table above.  Long-term debt includes current maturities. Long-term debt principal excludes $19.4 million of net discounts on senior notes and debt issuance costs. Variable rate interest obligations are based on rates as of December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 a $4.4 million increase in general taxes driven by higher property taxes; and \nGreat Plains Energy's 2015 earnings available for common shareholders decreased to $211.4 million or $1.37 per share from $241.2 million or $1.57 per share in 2014.\nIn August 2013, GMO entered into a note purchase agreement and issued the following series of unsecured senior notes:\nUnder stipulations with the MPSC and KCC, Great Plains Energy and KCP&L maintain common equity at not less than 30% and 35%, respectively, of total capitalization (including only the amount of short-term debt in excess of the amount of construction work in progress). KCP&L's long-term financing activities are subject to the authorization of the MPSC. In July 2014, the MPSC authorized KCP&L to issue up to $350.0 million of long-term debt and enter into interest rate hedging instruments in connection with such debt through June 30, 2016. At December 31, 2015, KCP&L had utilized all of this authorization.\nGreat Plains Energy's utility capital expenditures decreased $96.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in cash utility capital expenditures related to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station.\nGreat Plains Energy's corporate and other activities not included in the sole reportable business segment includes GMO activity other than its regulated utility operations, GPETHC and unallocated corporate charges.\n \u2022 an estimated $14 million increase from new retail rates in Missouri effective January 26, 2013 and in Kansas effective July 25, 2014; \n \u2022 a $22.2 million increase for recovery of program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense, primarily due to the implementation of KCP&L's MEEIA programs in August 2014; \n \u2022 a $1.6 million decrease from the remarketing of KCP&L's Series 1992, 1993A, 2007B Environmental Improvement Revenue Refunding (EIRR) bonds in April 2013 and Series 2008 EIRR bonds in July 2013 at lower interest rates; \nAt December 31, 2015, GMO had issued letters of credit totaling $2.5 million as credit support to certain counterparties that expire in 2016.\n \u2022 $6.1 million of income tax benefits. \nIn August 2015, KCP&L issued, at a discount, $350.0 million of 3.65% unsecured Senior Notes, maturing in 2025.\nThe following table summarizes Great Plains Energy's comparative results of operations.\nThe determination of fair value of the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques: an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using market multiples derived from the historical revenue, earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), net utility asset values and market prices of stock of peer companies. The results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit, which involves a significant amount of management judgment.\nThe Company has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded under GAAP. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues. Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers.\nKCP&L's and GMO's short-term financing activities are subject to the authorization of FERC. In November 2014, FERC authorized KCP&L to have outstanding at any one time up to a total of $1.0 billion in short-term debt instruments through December 2016. At December 31, 2015 there was $819.7 million available under this authorization. In January 2014, FERC authorized GMO to have outstanding at any one time up to a total of $750.0 million in short-term debt instruments through March 2016. At December 31, 2015, there was $706.3 million available under this authorization.\n \u2022 $125.0 million 3.49% Senior Notes, Series A, maturing in 2025; \nIn March 2013, KCP&L issued, at a discount, $300.0 million of 3.15% unsecured Senior Notes, maturing in 2023.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nMANAGEMENT'S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n (a) Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See explanation of gross margin below.  2015 Compared to 2014\nElectric utility's gross margin increased $53.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:\n\n \u2022 $75.0 million 4.06% Senior Notes, Series B, maturing in 2033; and \nKCP&L Non-Operating Income and Expenses\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nAt December 31, 2015, KCP&L had issued letters of credit totaling $23.5 million as credit support to certain counterparties that expire in 2016. KCP&L has issued $148.1 million of letters of credit as credit support for its variable rate EIRR Bond Series 2007A and B that expire in 2018.\n \u2022 a $16.0 million increase from energy efficiency programs under MEEIA consisting of $12.4 million for recovery of program costs, which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense, and $3.6 million for recovery of throughput disincentive; and \n \u2022 a $7.9 million increase in interest charges primarily due to a $7.2 million decrease in the debt component of AFUDC; and \nGreat Plains Energy's sole reportable business segment is electric utility. Electric utility consists of KCP&L, a regulated utility, GMO's regulated utility operations, which include its Missouri Public Service and St. Joseph Light & Power divisions, and GMO Receivables Company. Electric utility has approximately 6,400 MWs of owned generating capacity and engages in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 846,100 customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas. Electric utility's retail electricity rates are comparable to the national average of investor-owned utilities.\nGREAT PLAINS ENERGY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGreat Plains Energy\n \u2022 a $9.8 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to decreased pre-tax income.  Great Plains Energy's corporate and other activities loss decreased $6.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the release of uncertain tax positions related to former GMO non-regulated operations in the third quarter of 2014 which resulted in:\n \u2022 a $16.0 million increase from energy efficiency programs under MEEIA consisting of $12.4 million for recovery of program costs, which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense, and $3.6 million for recovery of throughput disincentive; and \nSee Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters.\n \u2022 a $2.3 million decrease in borrowing costs for short-term debt primarily driven by lower average commercial paper balances and interest rates in 2014 at GMO, as well as lower borrowing fees under KCP&L's and GMO's revolving credit facilities in 2014; and \nexpected beyond 2016 in amounts at least sufficient to meet the greater of ERISA or regulatory funding requirements; however, these amounts have not yet been determined.\n \u2022 an estimated $36 million increase due to new retail rates for KCP&L in Missouri effective September 29, 2015, and in Kansas effective July 25, 2014 and October 1, 2015; \n \u2022 a $10.4 million increase in general taxes due to increased property taxes. \nThe following table summarizes KCP&L's gross margin and MWhs sold.\nElectric Utility Depreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 an $11.8 million decrease in non-operating income and expenses driven by a $13.2 million decrease in the equity component of AFUDC primarily due to a lower average construction work in progress in 2015 due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service; \nKCP&L's other operating expenses increased $11.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $2.3 million decrease in borrowing costs for short-term debt primarily driven by lower average commercial paper balances and interest rates in 2014 at GMO, as well as lower borrowing fees under KCP&L's and GMO's revolving credit facilities in 2014; and \nA securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.\n \u2022 a $24.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to capital additions; \nFuel commitments consist of commitments for nuclear fuel, coal and coal transportation costs. Power commitments consist of commitments for renewable energy under power purchase agreements. KCP&L and GMO purchase capacity from other utilities and nonutility suppliers. Purchasing capacity provides the option to purchase energy if needed or when market prices are favorable. KCP&L has capacity sales agreements not included above that total $6.0 million, $1.9 million, $2.1 million, $1.9 million and $2.0 million per year from 2016 to 2020. Non-regulated natural gas transportation consists of MPS Merchant's commitments. Other represents individual commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nIncome Taxes\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 an $8.7 million increase in general taxes driven by higher property taxes; and \n \u2022 a $22.9 million increase in utility operating and maintenance expenses primarily driven by an increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA and amortization of deferred renewable energy costs under RESRAM, both of which have a direct offset in revenue, partially offset by a decrease in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to decreased refueling outage amortization and a planned mid-cycle maintenance outage in 2014; \nGreat Plains Energy's 2015 earnings available for common shareholders decreased to $211.4 million or $1.37 per share from $241.2 million or $1.57 per share in 2014 driven by:\nElectric Utility Gross Margin and MWh Sales\nKCP&L Interest Charges\nDescription of Business\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nGreat Plains Energy's cash flows from financing activities in 2013 reflect KCP&L's issuance, at a discount, of $300.0 million of 3.15% Senior Notes that mature in 2023 and the remarketing of $112.8 million of EIRR bonds previously held by KCP&L, with the proceeds used to repay short-term borrowings. In August 2013, GMO issued$350.0 million of senior notes and used the proceeds to repay a $248.7 million intercompany loan from Great Plains Energy and repay short-term borrowings. Great Plains Energy used the proceeds from GMO to repay its $250.0 million 2.75% Senior Notes that matured in August 2013.\n \u2022 an $8.3 million increase in transmission and distribution operating and maintenance expenses; and \nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of recently issued accounting standards.\n \u2022 an estimated $9 million decrease due to higher transmission expense; and \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on Great Plains\nThe Company incurs significant costs in providing defined benefit plans for substantially all active and inactive employees of KCP&L and GMO and its 47% ownership share of WCNOC's defined benefit plans. Funding of the plans follows legal and regulatory requirements with funding equaling or exceeding the minimum requirements of employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).\nUtility capital expenditures projected for the next five years, excluding AFUDC, are detailed in the following table. This utility capital expenditure plan is subject to continual review and change.\nGross Margin\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan. It is difficult to predict future pension costs, changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 0.5% increase or a 0.5% decrease in key actuarial assumptions. Each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n2015 Earnings Overview\nThe discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions: estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows. Management determined the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the MPSC and KCC and after-tax cost of debt. Estimated future cash flows are based on Great Plains Energy's internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of return on equity, anticipated earnings/returns related to future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts. Management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events. Should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions\n \u2022 a $7.0 million increase in income tax expense primarily driven by income tax benefits in 2014 related to the release of uncertain tax positions partially offset by decreased pre-tax income.

See the explanation of gross margin and the reconciliation to GAAP operating revenues under Great Plains Energy's Results of Operations for further information.\n \u2022 an estimated $16 million increase in other margin items including a change in customer mix, lower fuel and purchased power expenses that are not included in fuel recovery mechanisms and an increase in transmission costs recovered through the transmission delivery charge rider that began in the fourth quarter of 2015; \n (a) Consists of recovery of program costs of $20.5 million and $6.3 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, that have a direct offset in operating and maintenance expenses and recovery of throughput disincentive of $7.0 million and $2.9 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. \nIn the ordinary course of business, Great Plains Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include, for example, guarantees and letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiary's intended business purposes. The majority of these agreements guarantee the Company's own future performance, so a liability for the fair value of the obligation is not recorded.\nGreat Plains Energy operates through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Great Plains Energy's ability to make payments on its debt securities and its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries, proceeds from the issuance of its securities and borrowing under its revolving credit facility.\nGreat Plains Energy is a public utility holding company and does not own or operate any significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries.\n \u2022 a $1.2 million increase in the debt component of AFUDC resulting from a higher average construction work in progress balance in 2014 primarily due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station.  Electric Utility Income Tax Expense\n \u2022 a $7.2 million increase for recovery of renewable energy costs under RESRAM, which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense; \n \u2022 a $14.2 million increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in revenue, primarily due to the implementation of KCP&L's MEEIA programs in August 2014; \n \u2022 a $6.0 million increase in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses due to $8.7 million from a planned mid-cycle outage that began in March 2014 and concluded in May 2014, increased amortization of $3.4 million from a planned refueling outage that began in February 2013 and ended in April 2013, where costs are deferred and amortized between refueling outages, partially offset by $6.1 million of other decreases in operating and maintenance expenses; \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe following tables summarize electric utility's gross margin and MWhs sold.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nKCP&L's gross margin increased $47.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $6.0 million increase in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses due to $8.7 million from a planned mid-cycle outage that began in March 2014 and concluded in May 2014, increased amortization of $3.4 million from a planned refueling outage that began in February 2013 and ended in April 2013, where costs are deferred and amortized between refueling outages, partially offset by $6.1 million of other decreases in operating and maintenance expenses; \n \u2022 an estimated $6 million increase from weather-normalized retail demand; \nThe following table summarizes the electric utility segment results of operations.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses, capital losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities. This process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ. The Company records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n \u2022 a $7.2 million increase in amortization of deferred renewable energy costs under RESRAM, which have a direct offset in revenue; \n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's deferred income taxes - current asset decreased $78.1 million due to the adoption of ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. \n \u2022 secured Series 1993B EIRR bonds totaling $39.5 million at a fixed rate of 2.95% through maturity; and \n\n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's net utility plant in service increased $945.8 million and construction work in progress decreased $552.1 million primarily due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service. \n \u2022 GMO's electric retail rates contain a FAC tariff under which 95% of the difference between actual fuel cost, purchased power costs, certain transmission costs and off-system sales margin and the amount provided in base rates for these costs is passed along to GMO's customers. The FAC cycle consists of an accumulation period of six months beginning in June and December with FAC rate approval requested every six months for a twelve month recovery period. The FAC is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to GMO's electric retail customers. \n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's long-term debt increased $279.4 million due to the August 2015 issuance, at a discount, of KCP&L's $350.0 million of 3.65% Senior Notes partially offset by the September 2015 purchase in lieu of redemption of $71.9 million of KCP&L's EIRR bonds.  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIQUIDITY\n \u2022 an $8.6 million increase in general taxes driven by higher property taxes; \n (a) Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See explanation of gross margin under Great Plains Energy's Results of Operations.  KCP&L Gross Margin and MWh Sales\n \u2022 KCP&L's Kansas retail rates contain an Energy Cost Adjustment (ECA) tariff. The ECA tariff reflects the projected annual amounts of fuel, purchased power, emission allowances and asset-based off-system sales margin. These projected amounts are subject to quarterly re-forecasts. Any difference between the ECA revenue collected and the actual ECA amounts for a given year (which may be positive or negative) is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to Kansas retail customers over twelve months beginning April 1 of the succeeding year. \n \u2022 a $10.4 million increase in general taxes due to increased property taxes; \n\n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's asset retirement obligations increased $80.0 million primarily due to new asset retirement obligations related to CCR regulations. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n \u2022 an estimated $20 million increase in other margin items including a change in customer mix, lower fuel and purchased power expenses that are not included in fuel recovery mechanisms and an increase in transmission costs recovered through the transmission delivery charge rider that began in the fourth quarter of 2015; \n \u2022 a $22.2 million increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in revenue, primarily due to the implementation of KCP&L's MEEIA programs in August 2014; \nGreat Plains Energy's cash utility capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC to finance construction, were $677.1 million, $773.7 million and $669.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Utility capital expenditures represent a significant portion of Great Plains Energy's capital requirements. Utility capital expenditures projected for the next five years include improvements to generating, distribution and transmission facilities, software upgrades and expenditures for environmental projects at coal-fired power plants. Great Plains Energy intends to meet these capital requirements with a combination of internally generated funds and proceeds from short-term and long-term debt.\n \u2022 an estimated $20 million increase in other margin items including a change in customer mix, lower fuel and purchased power expenses that are not included in fuel recovery mechanisms and an increase in transmission costs recovered through the transmission delivery charge rider that began in the fourth quarter of 2015; \n \u2022 an estimated $36 million increase due to new retail rates for KCP&L in Missouri effective September 29, 2015, and in Kansas effective July 25, 2014 and October 1, 2015; \nGreat Plains Energy's cash used for investing activities varies with the timing of utility capital expenditures and purchases of investments and nonutility property. Investing activities are offset by proceeds from the sale of properties and insurance recoveries.\noperating and maintenance expense. The projected amounts are subject to an annual true-up with a twelve month recovery period. The TDC is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to KCP&L's Kansas electric retail customers. The TDC became effective in conjunction with new retail rates on October 1, 2015.\n \u2022 a $22.2 million increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in revenue, primarily due to the implementation of KCP&L's MEEIA programs in August 2014; \nRegulatory Proceedings\nGreat Plains Energy's liquid resources at December 31, 2015, consisted of $11.3 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $1,010.6 million of available borrowing capacity from unused bank lines of credit and receivable sale agreements. The available borrowing capacity consisted of $189.8 million from Great Plains Energy's revolving credit facility, $417.0 million from KCP&L's credit facilities and $403.8 million from GMO's credit facilities. See Notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the receivable sale agreements and revolving credit facilities, respectively. Generally, Great Plains Energy uses these liquid resources to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements, and from time to time issues equity and/or long-term debt to repay short-term debt or increase cash balances.\nAccounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test is a two step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the second step of the test is performed, consisting of assignment of the reporting unit's fair value to its assets and liabilities to determine an implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the impairment loss, if any, to be recognized in the financial statements. Great Plains Energy's regulated electric utility operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as they are included within the same operating segment and have similar economic characteristics.\n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's fuel inventories, at average cost increased $28.3 million primarily due to an increase in coal inventories primarily due to coal plant maintenance outages. \n \u2022 a $22.2 million increase for recovery of program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense, primarily due to the implementation of KCP&L's MEEIA programs in August 2014; \n \u2022 an estimated $6 million increase from weather-normalized retail demand; \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \u2022 an estimated $6 million increase from weather-normalized retail demand; \nGreat Plains Energy's utility capital expenditures increased $104.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in cash utility capital expenditures related to infrastructure and system improvements at KCP&L offset by a decrease in expenditures related to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station.\n (b) Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See explanation of gross margin under Great Plains Energy's Results of Operations. \n \u2022 a $53.4 million increase in gross margin driven by new retail rates, an increase in weather-normalized retail demand, recovery of program costs for energy efficiency programs under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (MEEIA) and recovery of renewable energy costs under the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard Rate Adjustment Mechanism (RESRAM), both of which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense; partially offset by milder weather; \nKCP&L's interest charges increased $11.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a decrease in the debt component of AFUDC primarily due to a lower average construction work in progress in 2015 due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service.\n \u2022 an estimated $15 million decrease due to weather driven by a 19% decrease in heating degree days in 2015 and a 15% decrease in cooling degree days in the second quarter of 2015 partially offset by an 18% increase in cooling degree days in the third quarter of 2015.  KCP&L Other Operating Expenses (including operating and maintenance expenses, general taxes and other)\nElectric utility's non-operating income and expenses decreased $11.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a $13.2 million decrease in the equity component of AFUDC primarily due to a lower average construction work in progress in 2015 due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 a $40.8 million increase in other operating expenses primarily due to: \n \u2022 an $8.7 million increase in general taxes driven by higher property taxes; and \nElectric utility's income tax expense decreased $4.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to decreased pre-tax income. Electric utility's income tax expense decreased $9.8 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreased pre-tax income.\nElectric Utility Other Operating Expenses (including utility operating and maintenance expenses, general taxes and other)\nGREAT PLAINS ENERGY SIGNIFICANT BALANCE SHEET CHANGES\n \u2022 an estimated $4 million decrease due to unfavorable weather driven by a 6% decrease in cooling degree days; \n \u2022 an estimated $24 million decrease due to weather driven by a 19% decrease in heating degree days in 2015 and a 15% decrease in cooling degree days in the second quarter of 2015 partially offset by an 18% increase in cooling degree days in the third quarter of 2015.  Electric utility's gross margin increased $23.3 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to:\nThe $78.6 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities for Great Plains Energy in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a $32.4 million decrease driven by changes in coal inventory levels, a $27.2 million decrease driven by the under recovery of costs subject to fuel recovery mechanisms where deferrals have exceeded recoveries and a $10.7 million decrease driven by an increase in solar rebates paid to customers.\n \u2022 a $10.8 million increase in interest charges primarily due to lower interest expense in 2014 related to the release of uncertain tax positions and a decrease in the debt component of AFUDC; and \n \u2022 unsecured Series 2007A-1 and 2007A-2 EIRR bonds totaling $10.0 million and $63.3 million, respectively, maturing in 2035 into one series: Series 2007A totaling $73.3 million at a variable rate that will be determined weekly.  Debt Agreements\nElectric utility's residential customers' usage is significantly affected by weather. Bulk power sales, the major component of wholesale sales, vary with system requirements, generating unit availability, transmission availability, fuel costs, and requirements of other electric systems. Electric utility's revenues contain certain recovery mechanisms as follows:\nElectric utility's other operating expenses increased $33.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:\n(December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014)\nGreat Plains Energy has an effective shelf registration statement for the sale of unlimited amounts of securities with the SEC that was filed and became effective in March 2015 and expires in March 2018.\nELECTRIC UTILITY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn January 2014, KCP&L and GMO completed the sale of two SPP-approved regional transmission projects, at cost, to Transource Missouri, LLC for cash proceeds of $37.7 million.\nWolf Creek's latest refueling outage began on February 28, 2015, and ended on May 3, 2015. Wolf Creek had a mid-cycle maintenance outage that began on March 8, 2014, and ended on May 13, 2014. Wolf Creek's next refueling outage is planned to begin in the third quarter of 2016.\nGreat Plains Energy's 2014 earnings available for common shareholders decreased to $241.2 million or $1.57 per share from $248.6 million or $1.62 per share in 2013.\n \u2022 an estimated $5 million decrease due to higher transmission expense; \nIn April 2013, KCP&L remarketed the following series of EIRR bonds that were previously held by KCP&L:\n \u2022 an estimated $24 million decrease due to weather driven by a 19% decrease in heating degree days in 2015 and a 15% decrease in cooling degree days in the second quarter of 2015 partially offset by an 18% increase in cooling degree days in the third quarter of 2015. \nGreat Plains Energy's cash flows from financing activities in 2014 reflect increased short-term borrowings at KCP&L primarily driven by capital expenditures and pension funding contributions.\n\n \u2022 $150.0 million 4.74% Senior Notes, Series C, maturing in 2043.  KCP&L\nThe assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted-average of long-term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan. The assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation. These assumptions, updated annually at the measurement date, are based on management's best estimates and judgment; however, material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs.\nSupplemental Capital Requirements and Liquidity Information\nElectric Utility Interest Charges\nAs of February 24, 2016, the major credit rating agencies rated Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's securities as detailed in the following table.\n \u2022 a $7.2 million increase for recovery of renewable energy costs under RESRAM, which have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expense; \nElectric utility's depreciation and amortization expense increased $24.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to capital additions. Electric utility's depreciation and amortization expense increased $16.3 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to capital additions.\nGreat Plains Energy incurs significant costs in providing non-contributory defined pension benefits. The costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience.\nElectric utility's net income decreased $19.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:\nAt December 31, 2015, Great Plains Energy has provided $138.4 million of credit support for GMO as follows:\n \u2022 a $10.0 million decrease in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to decreased refueling outage amortization of $3.6 million and $8.7 million from a planned mid-cycle maintenance outage in 2014.  Electric utility's other operating expenses increased $40.8 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to:\nGreat Plains Energy generated positive cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented. The $54.9 million increase in cash flows from operating activities for Great Plains Energy in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $34.2 million increase driven by a decrease in solar rebates paid to customers and an increase in the recovery of costs subject to fuel recovery mechanisms of $76.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in net income of $29.8 million and a decrease driven by deferred refueling outage costs of $23.7 million. Other changes in working capital are detailed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The individual components of working capital vary with normal business cycles and operations.\nThe market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by management's selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit, as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock. Management determined an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry. Changes in results of peer companies, selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of Great Plains Energy's reporting unit.\n\u2022$6.1 million of income tax benefits in 2014.\n \u2022 an estimated $19 million decrease due to lower wholesale margins partially offset by an estimated $14 million due to lower fuel and purchased power expense at KCP&L in Missouri, where there was no fuel recovery mechanism prior to September 29, 2015; \nLease commitments end in 2048. Operating lease commitments include railcars to serve jointly-owned generating units where KCP&L is the managing partner. Of the amounts included in the table above, KCP&L will be reimbursed by the other owners for approximately $1.5 million in 2016, $0.9 million in 2017 and approximately $0.4 million per year from 2018 to 2025, for a total of $6.0 million.\nImpact of Credit Ratings on Liquidity\n \u2022 an $8.3 million increase in transmission and distribution operating and maintenance expenses; and \nGreat Plains Energy's capital requirements are principally comprised of debt maturities and electric utility's construction and other capital expenditures. These items as well as additional cash and capital requirements are discussed below.\n \u2022 a $1.2 million increase in the debt component of AFUDC resulting from a higher average construction work in progress balance in 2014 primarily due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station; and \n \u2022 GMO's steam rates contain a Quarterly Cost Adjustment (QCA) under which 85% of the difference between actual fuel costs and base fuel costs is passed along to GMO's steam customers. The QCA is recorded as an increase to or reduction of other revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to GMO's steam customers.  Both KCP&L and GMO offer energy efficiency and demand side management programs to their Missouri retail customers under MEEIA and recover both program costs and throughput disincentive in retail rates. KCP&L recovers these items through a rider mechanism, with the difference between the amount collected and the actual program costs and throughput disincentive recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to KCP&L's Missouri retail customers. GMO recovers these items through base rates, with the difference between the amount collected and the actual program costs and throughput disincentive to be included as part of future GMO rate case proceedings.\n \u2022 a $14.2 million increase for recovery of program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in operating and maintenance expense, due to the implementation of KCP&L's MEEIA programs in August 2014; \n\n (b) Consists of recovery of program costs of $42.9 million, $20.7 million and $8.3 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, that have a direct offset in utility operating and maintenance expenses and recovery of throughput disincentive of $8.6 million, $7.8 million and $4.2 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n \u2022 a $24.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense driven by capital additions; \nManagement regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in electric utility's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to electric utility; and changes in laws and regulations. If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations. Electric utility's continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules. In the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of electric utility's operations, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided. Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nProjected Utility Capital Expenditures\nGreat Plains Energy has other insignificant long-term liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, which do not have a definitive cash payout date and are not included in the table above.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nGreat Plains Energy's cash flows from financing activities in 2015 reflect KCP&L's issuance, at a discount, of $350.0 million of 3.65% Senior Notes that mature in 2025, with the proceeds used to purchase in lieu of redemption $71.9 million of EIRR bonds and repay short-term borrowings.\nEnergy's results of operations and financial position. Management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of Great Plains Energy's results of operations and financial position. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Great Plains Energy Board of Directors (Board).\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding revolving credit facilities.\n \u2022 Great Plains Energy's commercial paper decreased $134.3 million primarily due to repayment with a portion of the proceeds from KCP&L's August 2015 issuance of $350.0 million of 3.65% Senior Notes partially offset by additional borrowings for general corporate purposes. \n (a) Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Additional contributions to the plans are expected beyond 2020 in amounts at least sufficient to meet the greater of ERISA or regulatory funding requirements; however, these amounts have not yet been determined. Amounts for years after 2016 are estimates based on information available in determining the amount for 2016. Actual amounts for years after 2016 could be significantly different than the estimated amounts in the table above.\nElectric utility's net income decreased $13.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to:\nFor additional information regarding the change in earnings, refer to the Great Plains Energy Results of Operations and the Electric Utility Results of Operations sections within this MD&A.\n \u2022 a $2.1 million decrease in after-tax interest expense; and \nIn 2015 and 2014, the Company contributed $76.9 million and $66.2 million to the pension plans, respectively, and expects to contribute $75.7 million in 2016 to satisfy the minimum ERISA funding requirements and the MPSC and KCC rate orders, the majority of which is expected to be paid by KCP&L. Additional contributions to the plans are\nPension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, life expectancies, compensation levels and employment periods), earnings on plan assets, the level of contributions made to the plan, and plan amendments. In addition, pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.\n \u2022 a $1.6 million decrease from the remarketing of KCP&L's Series 1992, 1993A, 2007B EIRR bonds in April 2013 and Series 2008 EIRR bonds in July 2013 at lower interest rates; \nKCP&L's depreciation and amortization expense increased $21.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to capital additions.\n\n \u2022 a $53.4 million increase in gross margin driven by: \nElectric Utility Non-Operating Income and Expenses\n \u2022 a $4.8 million decrease in income tax expense primarily driven by decreased pre-tax income.  Great Plains Energy's corporate and other activities loss increased $10.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the release of uncertain tax positions related to former GMO non-regulated operations in the third quarter of 2014 which resulted in:\nKCP&L has an effective shelf registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of notes and general mortgage bonds with the SEC that was filed and became effective in March 2015 and expires in March 2018.\n \u2022 an estimated $14 million increase from new retail rates in Missouri effective January 26, 2013 and in Kansas effective July 25, 2014; \nPension expense for KCP&L and GMO is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the MPSC and KCC. The orders allow the difference between pension costs under GAAP and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds, as appropriate.\nPensions\nIn 2015, Great Plains Energy's pension expense was $96.1 million under GAAP and $86.3 million for ratemaking. The impact on 2015 pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on GAAP pension costs. Under the Companies' rate agreements, any increase or decrease in GAAP pension expense would be deferred in a regulatory asset or liability for future ratemaking treatment. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for pensions.\nThe following table summarizes KCP&L's consolidated comparative results of operations.\n \u2022 an estimated $36 million increase due to new retail rates for KCP&L in Missouri effective September 29, 2015, and in Kansas effective July 25, 2014 and October 1, 2015; \nGreat Plains Energy intends to meet day-to-day cash flow requirements including interest payments, retirement of maturing debt, construction requirements, dividends and pension benefit plan funding requirements with a combination of internally generated funds and proceeds from short-term debt. From time to time, Great Plains Energy issues equity and/or long-term debt to repay short-term debt or increase cash balances. Great Plains Energy's intention to meet a portion of these requirements with internally generated funds may be impacted by the effect of inflation on operating expenses, the level of MWh sales, regulatory actions, compliance with environmental regulations and the availability of generating units.

CDD and HDD are used to reflect the demand for energy to cool or heat homes and buildings.\n \u2022 a $10.0 million decrease in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to decreased refueling outage amortization of $3.6 million and $8.7 million from a planned mid-cycle maintenance outage in 2014.  KCP&L Depreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 an estimated $19 million decrease due to lower wholesale margins partially offset by an estimated $14 million due to lower fuel and purchased power expense at KCP&L in Missouri, where there was no fuel recovery mechanism prior to September 29, 2015; and \nGREAT PLAINS ENERGY INCORPORATED\nElectric utility's interest charges decreased $7.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to:\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding related party transactions.\nElectric utility's interest charges increased $7.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a $7.2 million decrease in in the equity component of AFUDC primarily due to a lower average construction work in progress in 2015 due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service.\n \u2022 a $16.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to capital additions; \n \u2022 a $12.4 million increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in revenue; \n\n \u2022 a $10.0 million decrease in Wolf Creek operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to decreased refueling outage amortization of $3.6 million and $8.7 million from a planned mid-cycle maintenance outage in 2014. \n \u2022 an estimated $19 million decrease due to lower wholesale margins partially offset by an estimated $14 million due to lower fuel and purchased power expense at KCP&L in Missouri, where there was no fuel recovery mechanism prior to September 29, 2015; \n (a) Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See explanation of gross margin under Great Plains Energy's Results of Operations. \n \u2022 KCP&L's Kansas retail rates contain a Transmission Delivery Charge (TDC) rider. The TDC tariff reflects a mixture of historical and projected costs related to retail transmission, certain RTO fees and transmission \nThe annual impairment test for the $169.0 million of GMO acquisition goodwill was conducted on September 1, 2015. Fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill; therefore, there was no impairment of goodwill.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \u2022 a $7.5 million decrease in interest expense primarily due to: \n \u2022 an estimated $9 million decrease due to higher transmission expense; and \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nKCP&L and GMO are also authorized by FERC to participate in the Great Plains Energy money pool, an internal financing arrangement in which funds may be lent on a short-term basis to KCP&L and GMO. At December 31, 2015, GMO had an outstanding payable to Great Plains Energy under the money pool of $3.7 million.\n \u2022 Great Plains Energy guarantees of GMO long-term debt totaling $97.7 million, which includes debt with maturity dates ranging from 2016 to 2023.  Great Plains Energy has also guaranteed GMO's commercial paper program. At December 31, 2015, GMO had $43.7 million commercial paper outstanding. None of the guaranteed obligations are subject to default or prepayment if GMO's credit ratings were downgraded.\n\u2022$2.1 million lower after-tax interest expense in 2014; and\nLong-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under GAAP.\n \u2022 a $33.8 million increase in other operating expenses primarily due to: \n\n (c) N/M - not meaningful \n (c) N/M - not meaningful \n \u2022 a $23.3 million increase in gross margin driven by: \nAdditionally, the Company provides post-retirement health and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees and expects to make benefit contributions of $5.1 million under the provisions of these plans in 2016, the majority of which is expected to be paid by KCP&L.\ndiffer significantly from the current assumptions, revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of Great Plains Energy's reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill.\n \u2022 a $7.2 million increase in amortization of deferred renewable energy costs under RESRAM, which have a direct offset in revenue; \nFinancing Authorization\n \u2022 a $12.4 million increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA, which have a direct offset in revenue; \nThe ratings of Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's securities by the credit rating agencies impact their liquidity, including the cost of borrowings under their revolving credit agreements and in the capital markets. The Companies view maintenance of strong credit ratings as extremely important to their access to and cost of debt financing and to that end maintain an active and ongoing dialogue with the agencies with respect to results of operations, financial position and future prospects. While a decrease in these credit ratings would not cause any acceleration of Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's or GMO's debt, it could increase interest charges under Great Plains Energy's 6.875% Senior Notes due 2017 or Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's revolving credit agreements. A decrease in credit ratings could also have, among other things, an adverse impact, which could be material, on Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's access to capital, the cost of funds, the ability to recover actual interest costs in state regulatory proceedings, the type and amounts of collateral required under supply agreements and Great Plains Energy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries.\nKANSAS CITY POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nKCP&L's non-operating income and expenses decreased $10.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a decrease in the equity component of AFUDC primarily due to a lower average construction work in progress in 2015 due to environmental upgrades at KCP&L's La Cygne Station being placed into service.\nWolf Creek Mid-Cycle Maintenance Outage and Refueling Outage\nGross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Gross margin, as used by Great Plains Energy and KCP&L, is defined as operating revenues less fuel, purchased power and transmission. Expenses for fuel, purchased power and certain transmission costs, offset by wholesale sales margin, are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms, except for KCP&L's Missouri retail operations prior to September 29, 2015, when a cost adjustment mechanism was approved. As a result, operating revenues increase or decrease in relation to a significant portion of these expenses. Management believes that gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating electric utility's operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board. The Companies' definition of gross margin may differ from similar terms used by other companies.\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding regulatory proceedings.\nManagement believes the Company has adequate access to capital resources through cash flows from operations or through existing lines of credit to support these funding requirements.\nImpairments of Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n \u2022 a $13.3 million decrease in non-operating income driven by a decrease in the equity component of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC); \n \u2022 KCP&L's Missouri retail rates contain a Fuel Adjustment Clause (FAC) tariff under which 95% of the difference between actual fuel cost, purchased power costs, certain transmission costs and off-system sales margin and the amount provided in base rates for these costs is passed along to KCP&L's customers. The FAC cycle consists of an accumulation period of six months beginning in January and July with FAC rate approval requested every six months for a twelve month recovery period. The FAC is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to KCP&L's electric retail customers. The FAC became effective in conjunction with new retail rates on September 29, 2015. \n\nThe information in the following table is provided to summarize Great Plains Energy's cash obligations and

MD&A report:\n\n- Great Plains Energy's net income decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, driven primarily by lower wholesale margins, unfavorable weather, and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher retail revenues. \n\n- KCP&L's net income also decreased in 2015 due to similar factors - lower wholesale margins, milder weather, and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher retail revenues from new rates.\n\n- Electric utility capital expenditures were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to decreased spending on environmental upgrades.\n\n- Pension expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014. Future pension contributions will be required but amounts are not yet determined.\n\n- Great Plains Energy has adequate liquidity from cash, credit facilities, and ability to issue debt and equity. Credit ratings impact access to capital.\n\n- The report discusses significant changes in balance sheet accounts, results of operations, and cash flows between reporting periods. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded due to ratemaking.\n\n- Gross margin, a non-GAAP measure, is used internally to measure performance. \n\n- The report describes major capital projects, planned outages, impacts of weather, and regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nIn summary, the MD&A analyzes the company's financial performance, liquidity, credit ratings, capital expenditures, and outlook. Key factors impacting results are weather, rate changes, pension costs, capital projects, and wholesale market conditions."}
