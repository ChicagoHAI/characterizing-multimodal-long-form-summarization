The effect of lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, lower benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses, and lower insurance operating costs and other expenses, was offset by lower earned premiums and lower fee income and other.\nFee income, earned premiums, and insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased primarily due to the continued run-off of the variable annuity block of business.\nBenefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased due to lower death benefits and interest credited primarily due to the continued run-off of the variable annuity block of business.\nThe decrease in DAC amortization was primarily driven by the effect of a favorable unlock in 2017 compared to an unfavorable unlock in 2016. For further discussion of the unlock, see MD&A - Estimated Gross Profits.\nTotal net investment income decreased primarily due to lower asset levels as well as lower income received from previously impaired securities. For further discussion, see MD&A - Investments Results, Net Investment Income.\nNet realized capital losses decreased primarily due to the effect of transactional foreign currency revaluation, higher net gains on sales and lower impairments, partially offset by greater losses on non-qualifying foreign currency derivatives and the variable annuity hedge program. For further information, see MD&A - Investment Results, Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).\nInsurance operating costs and expenses decreased largely due to the run off of the business requiring less staff and other operating expenses.\nThe effective tax rate differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% in 2017 and 2016, primarily due to a charge of $396 as a result of Tax Reform enacted in December, 2017. Among other changes, Tax Reform reduced the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 which resulted in a reduction of the Company's net deferred tax assets, including its net operating loss carryovers. For a reconciliation of the income tax provision at the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes, see Note 9 - Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nINVESTMENT RESULTS\nComposition of Invested Assets\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities, available-for-sale (\"AFS\"), at fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities, at fair value using the fair value option (\"FVO\")\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities, AFS, at fair value\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>2,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans, at outstanding balance\n</td> <td>1,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Limited partnerships and other alternative investments\n</td> <td>1,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments [1]\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[1]\n</td> <td>Primarily relates to derivative instruments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Total investments decreased since December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of a decline in fixed maturities, AFS, and short-term investments.

The decrease was primarily attributable to lower income from previously impaired securities as well as lower make-whole payment income on fixed maturities and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans.\nThe new money yield, excluding certain U.S. Treasury securities and cash equivalent securities, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 3.6%, which was below the average yield of sales and maturities of 3.8% for the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the new money yield of 3.6% increased slightly from 3.5% in 2016 largely due to a slight increase in interest rates.\nWhile interest rates have risen recently, we expect the annualized net investment income yield in 2018, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, to be slightly below the portfolio yield earned in 2017. This assumes the Company earns less income in 2018 from make-whole payments on fixed maturities and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans than it did in 2017 and that reinvestment rates continue to be below the average yield of sales and maturities. The estimated impact on net investment income is subject to change as the composition of the portfolio changes through portfolio management and trading activities and changes in market conditions.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Realized Capital Losses\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Before-tax)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross gains on sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross losses on sales\n</td> <td>(58\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(93\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") losses recognized in earnings\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation allowances on mortgage loans\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Results of variable annuity hedge program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB derivatives, net\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Macro hedge program\n</td> <td>(260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(163\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total results of variable annuity hedge program\n</td> <td>(212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transactional foreign currency revaluation\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-qualifying foreign currency derivatives\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net [1]\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized capital losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(163\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[1]\n</td> <td>Primarily consists of changes in value of non-qualifying derivatives including credit derivatives and interest rate derivatives used to manage duration.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Gross Gains and Losses on Sales\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gross gains and losses on sales were primarily the result of duration, liquidity and credit management within corporate securities, equity securities and U.S Treasuries for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Variable Annuity Hedge Program\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2017, losses on the variable annuity hedge program included losses related to the macro hedge program primarily due to losses of $180 driven by improvements in the equity markets and $85 driven by time decay of options.

Actual results could differ, and in the past have differed, from those estimates.\nThe Company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>estimated gross profits used in the valuation and amortization of assets and liabilities associated with variable annuity and other universal life-type contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>living benefits required to be fair valued (in other policyholder funds and benefits payable);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>valuation of investments and derivative instruments including evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities and valuation allowances on mortgage loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Certain of these estimates are particularly sensitive to market conditions, and deterioration and/or volatility in the worldwide debt or equity markets could have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In developing these estimates management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements.\nEstimated Gross Profits\nEstimated gross profits ( EGPs\u201d) are used in the valuation and amortization of the DAC asset. Portions of EGPs are also used in the valuation of reserves for death and other insurance benefit features on variable annuity and other universal life-type contracts.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant EGP-based Balances\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DAC [1]\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Death and Other Insurance Benefit Reserves, net of reinsurance [2]\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[1]\n</td> <td>For additional information on DAC, see Note 6 - Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[2]\n</td> <td>For additional information on death and other insurance benefit reserves, see Note 7 - Reserves for Future Policy Benefits and Separate Account Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge to Income, Net of Tax, as a Result of Unlock\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DAC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Death and Other Insurance Benefit Reserves\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (pre-tax)\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax effect\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (after-tax)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Unlock charge in the table above includes both assumption unlocks and market unlocks.\nThe Unlock charge, after-tax, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to updates to the macro hedging program cost assumption to reflect 2017 activity, and the effect of updates for variable annuities, including a reduction to the assumed general account investment rates, largely offset by separate account returns being above our aggregated estimated returns during the period.\nThe Unlock charge, after-tax, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the reduction of the fixed annuity DAC balance to zero, updates to the macro hedging program cost to reflect 2016 activity, and the effect of assumption updates for variable annuities, including to mortality. These impacts were partially offset by separate account returns being above our aggregated estimated\nreturns during the period, largely due to an increase in equity markets, as well as the effect of reducing the assumption about expected future lapses of variable annuities.\nUse of Estimated Gross Profits in Amortization and Reserving\nFor most variable annuity contracts, the Company estimates gross profits over 20 years as EGPs emerging subsequent to that time frame are immaterial. Contracts sold in a particular year are aggregated into cohorts. Future gross profits for each cohort are projected over the estimated lives of the underlying contracts, based on future account value projections for variable annuity products. The projection of future account values requires the use of certain assumptions including: separate account returns; separate account fund mix; fees assessed against the contract holder's account balance; full and partial surrender rates; interest credited; mortality; and the extent and duration of hedging activities and hedging costs. Changes in these assumptions and changes to other policyholder behavior assumptions such as GMWB utilization, reaction to price increases, and asset allocations cause EGPs to fluctuate which impacts earnings.\nThe Company determines EGPs from a single deterministic reversion to mean ( RTM\u201d) separate account return projection which is an estimation technique commonly used by insurance entities to project future separate account returns. Through this estimation technique, the Company's DAC model is adjusted to reflect actual fund performance at the end of each quarter. Through consideration of recent market returns, the Company will unlock, or adjust, projected returns over a future period so that the account value returns to the long-term expected rate of return, providing that those projected returns do not exceed certain caps.\nAnnual Unlock of Assumptions\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed a comprehensive policyholder behavior assumption study which resulted in a non-market related after-tax charge of $35 and incorporated the results of that study into its projection of future gross profits. Additionally, throughout the year, the Company evaluates various aspects of policyholder behavior and will revise its policyholder assumptions if credible emerging data indicates that changes are warranted. The Company will continue to evaluate its assumptions related to policyholder behavior as initiatives to reduce the size of the annuity business are implemented by management. Upon completion of an annual assumption study or evaluation of credible new information, the Company will revise its assumptions to reflect its current best estimate. These assumption revisions will change the projected account values and the related EGPs in the DAC amortization models, as well as the death and other insurance benefit reserving model.\nAll assumption changes that affect the estimate of future EGPs including: the update of current account values; the use of the RTM estimation technique; and policyholder behavior assumptions are considered an Unlock in the period of revision. An Unlock adjusts DAC and death and other insurance benefit reserve balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with an offsetting benefit or charge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of the revision. An Unlock that results in an after-tax benefit generally occurs as a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being favorable compared to previous estimates. An Unlock that results in an after-tax charge generally occurs as a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being unfavorable compared to previous estimates.\nEGPs are also used to determine the expected excess benefits and assessments included in the measurement of death and other insurance benefit reserves. These excess benefits and assessments are derived from a range of stochastic scenarios that have been calibrated to the Company's RTM separate account returns. The determination of death and other insurance benefit reserves is also impacted by discount rates, lapses, volatilities, mortality assumptions and benefit utilization, including assumptions around annuitization rates.\nMarket Unlocks\nIn addition to updating assumptions in the fourth quarter of each year, an Unlock revises EGPs, on a quarterly basis, to reflect the Company's current best estimate assumptions and market updates of policyholder account value. The Unlock for future separate account returns is determined each quarter. Under RTM, the expected long term rate of return is 8.3%. The annual return assumed over the next five years of approximately (0.4)% was calculated based on the return needed over that period to produce an 8.3% return since March of 2009, the date the Company adopted the RTM estimation technique to project future separate account returns. Based on the expected trend of policy lapses and annuitizations, the Company expects approximately 55% of its block of variable annuities to runoff in the next 5 years.\nAggregate Recoverability\nAfter each quarterly Unlock, the Company also tests the aggregate recoverability of DAC by comparing the DAC balance to the present value of future EGPs. The margin between the DAC balance and the present value of future EGPs for variable annuities was 35% as of December 31, 2017. If the margin between the DAC asset and the present value of future EGPs is exhausted, then further reductions in EGPs would cause portions of DAC to be unrecoverable and the DAC asset would be written down to equal future EGPs.\nLiving Benefits Required to be Fair Valued\nFair values for GMWBs classified as embedded derivatives and included in other policyholder funds and benefits payable, are calculated using the income approach based upon internally developed models, because active, observable markets do not exist for those items. The fair value of these GMWBs and the related reinsurance and customized freestanding derivatives are calculated as an aggregation of the following components: Best Estimate Claim Payments; Credit Standing Adjustment; and Margins. The resulting aggregation is reconciled or calibrated, if necessary, to market information that is, or may be, available to the Company, but may not be observable by other market participants, including reinsurance discussions and transactions. The Company believes the aggregation of these components, as calibrated to the market information, results in an amount that the Company would be required to transfer to or receive from market participants in an active liquid market, if one existed, for those market participants to assume the risks associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits and the related reinsurance and customized derivatives. The fair value is likely to materially diverge from the ultimate settlement of the liability as the Company believes settlement will be based on our best estimate assumptions rather than those best estimate assumptions plus risk margins. In the absence of any transfer of the guaranteed benefit liability to a third party, the release of risk margins is likely to be reflected as realized gains in future periods' net income.\nA multidisciplinary group of finance, actuarial and risk management professionals reviews and approves changes to the Company's valuation model as well as associated controls.\nFor further discussion on the impact of fair value changes from living benefits see Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and for a discussion on the sensitivities of certain living benefits due to capital market factors see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Variable Product Guarantee Risks and Risk Management.\nValuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments\nFixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments and Free-standing Derivatives\nThe Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a \"waterfall\" approach comprised of the following pricing sources which are listed in priority order: quoted prices, prices from third-party pricing services, internal matrix pricing, and independent broker quotes. The fair value of free-standing derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded transactions and transactions cleared through central clearing houses (\"OTC-cleared\") may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. For further discussion, see the Fixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments and Free-standing Derivatives section in Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For further discussion on the GMWB customized derivative valuation methodology, see the GMWB Embedded, Customized and Reinsurance Derivatives section in fair value measurement, see Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEvaluation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities and Valuation Allowances on Mortgage Loans\nEach quarter, a committee of investment and accounting professionals evaluates investments to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment ( impairment\u201d) is present for AFS securities or a valuation allowance is required for mortgage loans. This evaluation is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. For further discussion of the accounting policies, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of impairments recorded, see the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments within the Investment Portfolio Risks and Risk Management section of the MD&A.\nValuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets\nDeferred tax assets represent the tax benefit of future deductible temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized if there is no change in tax law. Under U.S. GAAP, we test the value of deferred tax assets for impairment on a quarterly basis at the entity level within each tax jurisdiction, consistent with our filed tax returns. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we have considered all available evidence as of December 31, 2017 including past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had no valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies. From time to time, tax planning strategies could include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery, making investments which have specific tax characteristics, and business considerations such as asset-liability matching. Management views such tax planning strategies as prudent and feasible and would implement them, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets.\nIn connection with the pending sale of HLI and subsidiaries, the Company will forego approximately $460 of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryovers and foreign tax credits that will be retained by The Hartford. These deferred tax assets continue to be reflected as an asset in the accompanying financial statements as non-recoverability is contingent on the closing of the sale of the business.\nContingencies Relating to Corporate Litigation and Regulatory Matters\nManagement evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its best estimate,\u201d or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.\nThe Company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. Legal personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a reasonable possibility of loss. These matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the appropriate disclosure. The outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the Company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are subject to significant changes. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the Company. In view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the Company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations and liquidity in a particular quarterly or annual period.\nENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Hartford's Board of Directors ( the Board\u201d) has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, as described more fully in The Hartford's Proxy Statement, while management is tasked with the day-to-day management of The Hartford's risks.\nThe Company manages and monitors risk through risk policies, controls and limits. At the senior management level, an Enterprise Risk and Capital Committee ( ERCC\u201d) includes The Hartford's CEO, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Risk Officer, General Counsel and others as deemed necessary by the committee chair. The ERCC oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the Company. A number of functional committees sit underneath the ERCC, providing oversight of specific risk areas and recommending risk mitigation strategies to the ERCC. These committees include, but are not limited to, Asset Liability Committees, Catastrophe Risk Committee, Economic Capital Executive Committee, Emerging Risk Committees, Model Oversight Committees and the Operational Risk Committee. The Hartford's enterprise risk management (\"ERM\") function supports the ERCC and functional committees, and is tasked with, among other things:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> risk identification and assessment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> the development of risk appetites, tolerances, and limits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> risk monitoring; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> internal and external risk reporting.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Company categorizes its main risks as insurance risk, operational risk and financial risk.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, or from external events. Operational risk is inherent in the Company's business and functional areas. Operational risks include legal; cyber and information security; models; third party vendors; technology; operations; business continuity; disaster recovery; internal and external fraud; and compliance.\nOperational risk can result in financial loss, disruption of our business, regulatory actions or damage to our reputation.\nResponsibility for day-to-day management of operational risk lies within each business unit and functional area. ERM provides an enterprise-wide view of the Company's operational risk on an aggregate basis. ERM is responsible for establishing, maintaining and communicating the framework, principles and guidelines of the Company's operational risk management program. Operational risk mitigation strategies include the following:\n\u2022Establishing policies and monitoring risk tolerances and exceptions;\n\u2022Conducting business risk assessments and implementing action plans where necessary;\n\u2022Validating existing crisis management protocols;\n\u2022Identifying and monitoring emerging risks; and\n\u2022Purchasing insurance coverage.\nCybersecurity Risk\nThe Hartford has implemented an information protection program with established governance routines that promote an adaptive approach for assessing and managing risks. The Hartford has invested to build a \u2018defense-in-depth' strategy that uses multiple security measures to protect the integrity of the Company's information assets. This \u2018defense-in-depth' strategy aligns to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework and provides preventative, detective and responsive measures that collectively protects the company. Various cyber assurance methods, including security metrics, third party security assessments, external penetration testing, red team exercises, and cyber war game exercises are used to test the effectiveness of the overall cybersecurity control environment.\nThe Hartford, like many other large financial services companies, blocks attempted cyber intrusions on a daily basis. In the event of a cyber intrusion, the company invokes its Cyber Incident Response Program commensurate with the nature of the intrusion. While the actual methods employed differ based on the event, our approach employs internal teams and outside advisors with specialized skills to support the response and recovery efforts and requires elevation of issues, as necessary, to senior management.\nFrom a governance perspective, senior members of our Enterprise Risk Management, Information Protection and Internal Audit functions provide detailed, regular reports on cybersecurity matters to The Hartford's Board, including the Finance, Investment, and Risk Management Committee (FIRMCo), which has principal responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity risk, and/or the Audit Committee,\nwhich oversees controls for the Company's major risk exposures. The topics covered by these updates include The Hartford's activities, policies and procedures to prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, as well as lessons learned from cybersecurity incidents and internal and external testing of our protection measures. FIRMCo meets at each regular Board meeting and is briefed on cyber risks at least annually.\nFinancial Risk Management\nFinancial risks include direct and indirect risks to the Company's financial objectives coming from events that impact market conditions or prices. Some events may cause correlated movement in multiple risk factors. The primary sources of financial risks are the Company's general account assets and the liabilities and the guarantees which the company has written over various liability products, particularly its fixed and variable annuity guarantees. Consistent with its risk appetite, the Company establishes financial risk limits to control potential loss on a U.S. GAAP, statutory, and economic basis. Exposures are actively monitored, and mitigated where appropriate. The Company uses various risk management strategies, including reinsurance and over-the-counter and exchange traded derivatives with counterparties meeting the appropriate regulatory and due diligence requirements. Derivatives are utilized to achieve one of four Company-approved objectives: hedging risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; managing liquidity; controlling transaction costs; or entering into synthetic replication transactions. Derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the Company's compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings or capital arising from the Company's inability or perceived inability to meet its contractual funding obligations when they come due.\nSources of Liquidity Risk include funding risk, company-specific liquidity risk and market liquidity risk resulting from differences in the amount and timing of sources and uses of cash as well as company-specific and general market conditions. Stressed market conditions may impact the ability to sell assets or otherwise transact business and may result in a significant loss in value.\nInadequate capital resources and liquidity could negatively affect the Company's overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows from its businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.\nThe Company has defined ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to assess liquidity across the enterprise under both current and stressed market conditions. The Company measures and manages liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within prescribed limits across legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory and operational limitations to the transferability of liquidity. The Company also monitors internal and external conditions, and identifies material risk changes and emerging risks that may impact liquidity. The Company's CFO has primary responsibility for liquidity risk.\nFor further discussion on liquidity see the section on Capital Resources and Liquidity.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk encompasses exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. Interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads.\nThe Company has exposure to interest rates arising from its fixed maturity securities and interest sensitive liabilities. In addition, certain product liabilities, including those containing GMWB or GMDB, expose the Company to interest rate risk but also have significant equity risk. These liabilities are discussed as part of the Variable Product Guarantee Risks and Risk Management section. Management also evaluates performance of certain products based on net investment spread which is, in part, influenced by changes in interest rates.\nAn increase in interest rates from current levels is generally a favorable development for the Company. Interest rate increases are expected to provide additional net investment income, reduce the cost of the variable annuity hedging program, and limit the potential risk of margin erosion due to minimum guaranteed crediting rates in certain products. However, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time period, certain businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk refers to the risk that policyholders will surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment requiring the Company to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. An increase in interest rates may also impact the Company's tax planning strategies and in particular its ability to utilize tax benefits of previously recognized realized capital losses.\nA decline in interest rates results in certain mortgage-backed and municipal securities being more susceptible to paydowns and prepayments or calls. During such periods, the Company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields. Lower interest rates will also likely result in lower net investment income, increased hedging costs associated with variable annuities and, if declines are sustained for a long period of time, it may subject the Company to reinvestment risk and possibly reduced profit margins associated with guaranteed crediting rates on certain products. Conversely, the fair value of the investment portfolio will increase when interest rates decline.\nThe Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by constructing investment portfolios that maintain asset allocation limits and asset/liability duration matching targets which may include the use of derivatives. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models and cash flows simulation under various market scenarios of the liabilities and their supporting investment portfolios. Key metrics that the Company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities include duration, convexity and key rate duration.\nThe Company also utilizes a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its investment portfolio or to hedge liabilities. Interest rate caps, floors, swaps, swaptions, and futures may be used to manage portfolio duration. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. The use of such swaps enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to desired objectives and manage the duration profile within established tolerances. Interest rate swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flow of a forecasted purchase or sale of fixed rate securities due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk, including offsetting positions, totaled $4.7 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, related to investments and $34 and $100, respectively, related to liabilities. The fair value of these derivatives was $(356) and $(404) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts do not include derivatives associated with the Variable Annuity Hedging Program.\nFixed Income Investments\nThe fair value of fixed income investments, which include fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, and short-term investments, was $26.8 billion and $28.1 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The weighted average duration of the portfolio, including derivative instruments, was approximately 7.6 years and 6.8 years as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLiabilities\nThe Company's issued investment contracts and certain insurance product liabilities, other than non-guaranteed separate accounts, include asset accumulation vehicles such as fixed annuities, guaranteed investment products, and other investment and universal life-type contracts. The primary risk associated with these products is that, despite the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns.\nAsset accumulation vehicles primarily require a fixed rate payment, often for a specified period of time, and fixed rate annuities contain surrender values that are based upon a market value adjusted formula if held for shorter periods. In addition, certain products such as corporate owned life insurance contracts and the general account portion of variable annuity products credit interest to policyholders subject to market conditions and minimum interest rate guarantees. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $4,728 and $5,187, respectively, of liabilities for fixed annuities and $120 and $194, respectively, of liabilities for guaranteed investment products.\nThe Company's issued non-investment type contracts include structured settlement contracts, terminal funding agreements, and on-benefit payout annuities (i.e., the annuitant is currently receiving benefits). The cash outflows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing. Similar to investment-type products, the aggregate cash flow payment streams are relatively predictable. Products in this category may rely upon actuarial pricing assumptions (including mortality and morbidity) and have an element of cash flow uncertainty. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $6,841 and $6,887, respectively of liabilities for structured settlements and terminal funding agreements and $1,627 and $1,636, respectively, of liabilities for on-benefit payout annuities.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nFixed Liabilities and the Invested Assets Supporting Them\nIncluded in the following table is the before-tax change in the net economic value of investment contracts including structured settlements, fixed annuity contracts and terminal funding agreements for which the payment rates are fixed at contract issuance and/or the investment experience is substantially absorbed by the Company's operations, along with the corresponding invested assets. Also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by the Company to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the investment portfolios supporting these contracts. This analysis does not include the assets and corresponding liabilities of certain insurance products such as certain life contingent annuities. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments. Insulated separate account assets and liabilities are excluded from the analysis because gains and losses in separate accounts accrue to policyholders.\nThe calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in net economic value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate sensitivity of fixed liabilities and invested assets supporting them\n</td> <td>Change in Net Economic Value as of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis point shift\n</td> <td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Decrease) increase in economic value, before tax\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(818\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(634\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments related to the businesses included in the table above was $18.0 billion and $18.3 billion, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The assets supporting the fixed liabilities are monitored and managed within set duration guidelines, and are evaluated on a daily basis, as well as annually using scenario simulation techniques in compliance with regulatory requirements.\nInvested Assets Not Supporting Fixed Liabilities\nThe following table provides an analysis showing the estimated before-tax change in the fair value of the Company's investments and related derivatives, excluding assets supporting fixed liabilities which are included in the table above, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate sensitivity of invested assets not supporting fixed liabilities\n</td> <td>Change in Fair Value as of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis point shift\n</td> <td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase (decrease) in fair value, before tax\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(409\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments related to the businesses included in the table above was $8.8 billion and $9.8 billion, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. The Company's sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.\nEquity Risk\nEquity risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of global equities or equity indices. The Company has exposure to equity risk from assets under management and embedded derivatives within the Company's variable annuities. Equity Risk on the Company's Variable Annuity products is mitigated through various hedging programs. For further information, refer to Enterprise Risk Management, Managing Equity Risk on Variable Annuity Products.\nThe Company's exposure to equity risk includes the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of its businesses such as variable annuities where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. Declines in equity markets may also decrease the value of limited partnerships and other alternative investments. In addition, the Company offers certain guaranteed benefits, primarily associated with variable annuity products, which increases the Company's potential benefit exposure in periods that equity markets decline. For further discussion of equity risk, see the Managing Equity Risk on Variable Annuity Products section.\nReinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy\nThe Company utilizes reinsurance to transfer risk to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers. Reinsurance is used to transfer certain risk to reinsurance companies based on specific risk concentrations. All reinsurance processes are aligned under a single enterprise reinsurance risk management policy. Reinsurance purchasing is a centralized function across The Hartford to support a consistent strategy and to ensure that the reinsurance activities are fully integrated into the organization's risk management processes.\nThe Company uses reinsurance for a portion of contracts with GMWB riders issued prior to the second quarter of 2006. The Company also uses reinsurance for a majority of the GMDB NAR.\nThe Company cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers to enable the Company to manage capital and risk exposure. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company.\nThe components of the gross and net reinsurance recoverables are summarized as follows: Table 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance Recoverables\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for future policy benefits and other policyholder funds and benefits payable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Allowance for uncollectible reinsurance [1]\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net reinsurance recoverables\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[1]\n</td> <td>No allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was required as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2017, the Company has reinsurance recoverables from MassMutual and Prudential of $8.3 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has reinsurance recoverables from MassMutual and Prudential of $8.6 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. The Company's obligations to its direct policyholders that have been reinsured to MassMutual and Prudential are secured by invested assets held in trust. As of December 31, 2017, net of invested assets held in trust, the Company has no reinsurance-related concentrations of credit risk greater than 10% of the Company's Consolidated Stockholder's Equity.\nManaging Equity Risk on Variable Annuity Products\nMost of the Company's variable annuities include GMDB and certain contracts with GMDB also include GMWB features. Declines in the equity markets will increase the Company's liability for these benefits. Many contracts with a GMDB include a maximum anniversary value (\"MAV\"), which in rising markets resets the guarantee on the anniversary to be 'at the money'. As the MAV increases, it can increase the NAR for subsequent declines in account value. Generally, a GMWB contract is \u2018in the money' if the contractholder's guaranteed remaining balance (\"GRB\") becomes greater than the account value.\nThe NAR is generally defined as the guaranteed minimum benefit amount in excess of the contractholder's current account value. Variable annuity account values with guarantee features were $40.8 billion and $40.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nThe following tables summarize the account values of the Company's variable annuities with guarantee features and the NAR split between various guarantee features (retained net amount at risk does not take into consideration the effects of the variable annuity hedge programs currently in place as of each balance sheet date).\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Variable Annuity Guarantees as of December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in billions)\n</td> <td>Account Value\n</td> <td>Gross Net Amount at Risk\n</td> <td>Retained Net Amount at Risk\n</td> <td>% of Contracts In the Money[2]\n</td> <td>% In the Money[2][3]\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable Annuity [1]\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMDB [4]\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Variable Annuity Guarantees as of December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in billions)\n</td> <td>Account Value\n</td> <td>Gross Net Amount at Risk\n</td> <td>Retained Net Amount at Risk\n</td> <td>% of Contracts In the Money[2]\n</td> <td>% In the Money[2][3]\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable Annuity [1]\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMDB [4]\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[1]\n</td> <td>Contracts with a guaranteed living benefit also have a guaranteed death benefit.

The GMDB NAR disclosed in the preceding tables is a point in time measurement and assumes that all participants utilize the GMDB on that measurement date.\nThe Company expects to incur GMDB payments in the future only if the policyholder has an in the money\u201d GMDB at their death. For policies with a GMWB rider, the company expects to incur GMWB payments in the future only if the account value is reduced over time to a specified level through a combination of market performance and periodic withdrawals, at which point the contractholder will receive an annuity equal to the GRB which is generally equal to premiums less withdrawals. For the Company's lifetime\u201d GMWB products, this annuity can exceed the GRB. As the account value fluctuates with equity market returns on a daily basis and the lifetime\u201d GMWB payments may exceed the GRB, the ultimate amount to be paid by the Company, if any, is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than the Company's current carried liability. For additional information on the Company's GMWB liability, see Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on the Company's GMDB liability, see Note 7 - Reserves for Future Policy Benefits and Separate Account Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nVariable Annuity Market Risk Exposures\nThe following table summarizes the broad Variable Annuity Guarantees offered by the Company and the market risks to which the guarantee is most exposed from a U.S. GAAP accounting perspective.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable Annuity Guarantees [1]\n</td> <td>U.S. GAAP Treatment [1]\n</td> <td>Primary Market Risk Exposures [1]\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMDB and life-contingent component of the GMWB\n</td> <td>Accumulation of the portion of fees required to cover expected claims, less accumulation of actual claims paid\n</td> <td>Equity Market Levels\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB (excluding life-contingent portions)\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>Equity Market Levels / Implied Volatility / Interest Rates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[1]\n</td> <td>Each of these guarantees and the related U.S. GAAP accounting volatility will also be influenced by actual and estimated policyholder behavior.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRisk Hedging\nVariable Annuity Hedging Program\nThe Company's variable annuity hedging program is primarily focused, through the use of reinsurance and capital market derivative instruments, on reducing the economic exposure to market risks associated with guaranteed benefits that are embedded in our variable annuity contracts. The variable annuity hedging program also considers the potential impacts on statutory capital.\nReinsurance\nThe Company uses reinsurance for a portion of contracts with GMWB riders issued prior to the second quarter of 2006. The Company also uses reinsurance for a majority of the GMDB NAR.\nCapital Market Derivatives\nGMWB Hedge Program\nUnder the dynamic hedging program, the Company enters into derivative contracts to hedge market risk exposures associated with the GMWB liabilities that are not reinsured. These derivative contracts include customized swaps, interest rate swaps and futures, and equity swaps, options, and futures, on certain indices including the S&P 500 index, EAFE index, and NASDAQ index.\nAdditionally, the Company holds customized derivative contracts to provide protection from certain capital market risks for the remaining term of specified blocks of non-reinsured GMWB riders. These customized derivative contracts are based on policyholder behavior assumptions specified at the inception of the derivative contracts. The Company retains the risk for differences between assumed and actual policyholder behavior and between the performance of the actively managed funds underlying the separate accounts and their respective indices.\nWhile the Company actively manages this dynamic hedging program, increased U.S. GAAP earnings volatility may result from factors including, but not limited to: policyholder behavior, capital markets, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, changes in hedging positions and the relative emphasis placed on various risk management objectives.\nMacro Hedge Program\nThe Company's macro hedging program uses derivative instruments, such as options and futures on equities and interest rates, to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from GMWB and GMDB liabilities on the Company's statutory surplus. These macro hedges cover some of the residual risks not otherwise covered by the dynamic hedging program. Management assesses this residual risk under various scenarios in designing and executing the macro hedge program. The macro hedge program will result in additional U.S. GAAP earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory reserve and capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in U.S. GAAP liabilities.\nVariable Annuity Hedging Program Sensitivities\nThe underlying guaranteed withdrawal benefit liabilities (excluding the life contingent portion of GMWB contracts) and hedge assets within the GMWB hedge and Macro hedge programs are carried at fair value.\nThe following table presents our estimates of the potential instantaneous impacts from sudden market stresses related to equity market prices, interest rates, and implied market volatilities. The following sensitivities represent: (1) the net estimated difference between the change in the fair value of GMWB liabilities and the underlying hedge instruments and (2) the estimated change in fair value of the hedge instruments for the macro program, before the impacts of amortization of DAC and taxes. As noted in the preceding discussion, certain hedge assets are used to hedge liabilities that are not carried at fair value and will not have a liability offset in the U.S. GAAP sensitivity analysis. All sensitivities are measured as of December 31, 2017 and are related to the fair value of liabilities and hedge instruments in place at that date for the Company's variable annuity hedge programs. The impacts presented in the table that follows are estimated individually and measured without consideration of any correlation among market risk factors.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP Sensitivity Analysis (before tax and DAC) as of December 31, 2017 [1]\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>GMWB\n</td> <td>Macro\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity Market Return\n</td> <td>-20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>-10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>-20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>-10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Potential Net Fair Value Impact\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Rates\n</td> <td>-50bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-25bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+25bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-50bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-25bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+25bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Potential Net Fair Value Impact\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Implied Volatilities\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>-10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>-10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Potential Net Fair Value Impact\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(72\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(77\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[1]\n</td> <td>These sensitivities are based on the following key market levels as of December 31, 2017: 1) S&P of 2,674; 2) 10yr US swap rate of 2.42%; and 3) S&P 10yr volatility of 23.80%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe preceding sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be used to predict the future financial performance of the Company's variable annuity hedge programs.

The Company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, which primarily consist of fixed maturity and equity investments, foreign denominated cash and a yen denominated fixed payout annuity.\nChanges in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities. Based on the fair values of the Company's non-U.S. dollar denominated securities and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, management estimates that a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by an immaterial amount.\nThe open foreign currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using currency futures/forwards/swaps. In order to manage the currency risk related to any non-U.S. dollar denominated liability contracts, the Company enters into foreign currency swaps or holds non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.\nNon-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities and cash\nThe fair values of the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $104 and $77, respectively. Included in these amounts are $5 and $5 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities that directly support liabilities denominated in the same currencies. The currency risk of the remaining non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities are hedged with foreign currency swaps. The Company holds $216 of yen-denominated cash, of which $214 is derivative cash collateral pledged by counterparties and has an offsetting collateral liability. In addition, the Company holds $306 of euro-denominated cash which is hedged with foreign currency forwards.\nThe Company has entered into pay U.S. dollar, receive yen swap contracts to hedge the currency exposure between the U.S. dollar denominated assets and the yen denominated fixed liability reinsurance payments.\nNon-U.S. dollar denominated funding agreement liability contracts\nThe Company hedged the foreign currency risk associated with these liability contracts with currency rate swaps. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the derivatives used to hedge foreign currency exchange risk related to foreign denominated liability contracts had a total notional amount of $94 and $94, and a total fair value of $(11) and $(25), respectively.\nFinancial Risk on Statutory Capital\nStatutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease in any period depending upon a variety of factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. In general, as equity market levels and interest rates decline, the amount and volatility of both our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin can be materially negatively affected, sometimes at a greater than linear rate. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. Factors include:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Differences in performance of variable subaccounts relative to indices and/or realized equity and interest rate volatilities may affect RBC ratios.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rising equity markets will generally result in an increase in statutory surplus and RBC ratios. However, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and RBC requirements could increase with rising equity markets, resulting in lower RBC ratios. The Company has reinsured approximately 43% of its risk associated with GMWB and 81% of its risk associated with the aggregate GMDB exposure. These reinsurance agreements reduce the Company's exposure to changes in the statutory reserves and the related capital and RBC ratios associated with changes in the capital markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A decrease in the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, due in part to credit spreads widening, may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and RBC ratios.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Credit spreads on invested assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses.

The Company's financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by its statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk to earnings or capital due to uncertainty of an obligor's or counterparty's ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with contractually agreed upon terms. Credit risk is comprised of three major factors: the risk of change in credit quality, or credit migration risk; the risk of default; and the risk of a change in value due to changes in credit spread.\nThe majority of the Company's credit risk is concentrated in its investment holdings but it is also present in the Company's reinsurance and insurance portfolios. A decline in creditworthiness is typically associated with an increase in an investment's credit spread, potentially resulting in an increase in other-than-temporary impairments and an increased probability of a realized loss upon sale. Premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables are also subject to credit risk based on the counterparty's unwillingness or inability to pay.\nThe objective of the Company's enterprise credit risk management strategy is to identify, quantify, and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis and to limit potential losses in accordance with an established credit risk management policy. The Company primarily manages its credit risk by holding a diversified mix of investment grade issuers and counterparties across its investment, reinsurance, and insurance portfolios. Potential losses are also limited within portfolios by diversifying across geographic regions, asset types, and sectors.\nThe Company manages credit risk on an on-going basis through the use of various processes and analyses. Both the investment and reinsurance areas have formulated procedures for counterparty approvals and authorizations, which establish minimum levels of creditworthiness and financial stability. Credits considered for investment are subjected to underwriting reviews. Within the investment portfolio, private securities are subject to committee review for approval. Mitigation strategies vary across the three sources of credit risk, but may include:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investing in a portfolio of high-quality and diverse securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Selling investments subject to credit risk;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Hedging through use of single name or basket credit default swaps;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Clearing transactions through central clearing houses that require daily variation margin;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Entering into contracts only with strong creditworthy institutions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Requiring collateral; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Non-renewing policies/contracts or reinsurance treaties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Aggregate counterparty credit quality and exposure is monitored on a daily basis utilizing an enterprise-wide credit exposure information system that contains data on issuers, ratings, exposures, and credit limits. Exposures are tracked on a current and potential basis and aggregated by ultimate parent across investments, reinsurance receivables, insurance products with credit risk, and derivative counterparties.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer, or counterparty greater than 10% of the Company's stockholder's equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government securities. For further discussion of concentration of credit risk in the investment portfolio, see the Concentration of Credit Risk section in Note 3 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk of Derivatives\nThe Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction. Downgrades to the credit ratings of the Company's insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives including those used to hedge benefit guarantees of variable annuities. In some cases, downgrades may give derivative counterparties for over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives and clearing brokers for OTC-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. In addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require collateralization before entering into any new trades. This would restrict the supply of derivative instruments commonly used to hedge variable annuity guarantees, particularly long-dated equity derivatives and interest rate swaps.\nOn October 23, 2017, Moody's lowered its counterparty credit and insurer financial strength ratings on Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company to Baa3. Given this downgrade action, termination rating triggers in two derivative counterparty relationships in which the Company has open derivative contracts were impacted. The Company has successfully re-negotiated the rating triggers with these counterparties. Accordingly, the Company does not expect the current hedging programs to be adversely impacted by the announcement of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company. In addition, as a result of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, the Company is required to post an additional $9 of collateral related to a single counterparty relationship.\nManaging the Credit Risk of Counterparties to Derivative Instruments\nThe Company has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company's exposure to credit risk. The Company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company's policies with respect to derivative counterparty exposure establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company's risk management team and reviewed by senior management.\nThe Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better. The Company also generally requires that OTC derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\"ISDA\") Master Agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. The Company enters into credit support annexes in conjunction with the ISDA agreements, which require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds.\nThe Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day's market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives exceed the contractual thresholds. In accordance with industry standard and the contractual agreements, collateral is typically settled on same business day. The Company has exposure to credit risk\nfor amounts below the exposure thresholds which are uncollateralized, as well as for market fluctuations that may occur between contractual settlement periods of collateral movements.\nFor the company's derivative programs, the maximum uncollateralized threshold for a derivative counterparty for a single legal entity is $10. The Company currently transacts OTC derivatives in two legal entities that have a threshold greater than zero. The maximum combined threshold for a single counterparty across all legal entities that use derivatives is $10. In addition, the Company may have exposure to multiple counterparties in a single corporate family due to a common credit support provider; however, the thresholds for these relationships are zero. Based on the contractual terms of the collateral agreements, these thresholds may be immediately reduced due to a downgrade in either party's credit rating. For further discussion, see the Derivative Commitments section of Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred no losses on derivative instruments due to counterparty default.\nUse of Credit Derivatives\nThe Company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield. The Company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity, referenced index, or asset pool. The Company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that purchase credit protection was $80 and $131, respectively, while the fair value was $(3) and $(3), respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.\nThe Company also enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company's investment policies. These swaps reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include customized diversified portfolios of corporate issuers, which are established within sector concentration limits and may be divided into tranches which possess different credit ratings. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that assume credit risk was $380 and $458, respectively, while the fair value was $3 and $4, respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.\nFor further information on credit derivatives, see Note 4- Derivative Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInvestment Portfolio Risk\nInvestment Portfolio Composition\nThe following table presents the Company's fixed maturities, AFS, by credit quality. The credit ratings referenced throughout this section are based on availability, and are generally the midpoint of the available ratings among Moody's, S&P, Fitch and Morningstar. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed Maturities by Credit Quality\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Fair Value\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States Government/Government agencies\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAA\n</td> <td>1,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA\n</td> <td>2,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A\n</td> <td>6,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>7,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB\n</td> <td>6,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>6,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BB & below\n</td> <td>1,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fixed maturities, AFS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fair value of AFS securities decreased, as compared with December 31, 2016, due to the continued run-off of the Company's business.

December 31, 2016 was due to the continued run-off of the Company's business, partially offset by an increase in valuations due to tighter credit spreads.\nEuropean Exposure\nThe European economy performed better than expected in 2017, propelled by resilient private consumption, stronger growth around the world and lower unemployment. While some economic conditions have improved, sluggish wage growth points towards continued accommodative monetary policy throughout Europe in 2018. The Company manages the credit risk associated with the European securities within the investment portfolio on an on-going basis using several processes which are supported by macroeconomic analysis and issuer credit analysis. For additional details regarding the Company's management of credit risk, see the Credit Risk section of this MD&A.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's European investment exposure had an amortized cost and fair value of $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, or 6% of total invested assets; as of December 31, 2016, amortized cost and fair value totaled $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The investment exposure largely relates to corporate entities which are domiciled in or generate a significant portion of their revenue within the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the weighted average credit quality of European investments was BBB+ and A-, respectively. Entities domiciled in the United Kingdom comprise the Company's largest exposure; as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the U.K. exposure totals less than 3% of total invested assets and largely relates to industrial and financial services securities and has an average credit rating of BBB+. The majority of the European investments are U.S. dollar-denominated, and those securities that are British pound or euro-denominated are hedged to U.S. dollars. For a discussion of foreign currency risks, see the Foreign Currency Exchange Risk section of this MD&A.\nFinancial Services\nThe Company's investment in the financial services sector is predominantly through investment grade banking and insurance institutions.

These loans are collateralized by a variety of commercial properties and are diversified both geographically throughout the United States and by property type. These loans are primarily in the form of whole loans, where the Company is the sole lender, but may include participations. Loan participations are loans where the Company has purchased or retained a portion of an outstanding loan or package of loans and participates on a pro-rata basis in collecting interest and principal pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement. As of December 31, 2017, loans within the Company's mortgage loan portfolio that have had extensions or restructurings other than what is allowable under the original terms of the contract are immaterial.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Table 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\nCost [1]\n</td> <td>Valuation\nAllowance\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>Amortized\nCost [1]\n</td> <td>Valuation\nAllowance\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Whole loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A-Note participations\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[1]\n</td> <td>Amortized cost represents carrying value prior to valuation allowances, if any.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> During 2017, the Company funded $389 of commercial whole loans with a weighted average loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) ratio of 70% and a weighted average yield of 3.9%. The Company continues to originate commercial whole loans within primary markets, such as office, industrial and multi-family, focusing on loans with strong LTV ratios and high quality property collateral. There were no mortgage loans held for sale as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.\nValuation Allowances on Mortgage Loans\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the valuation allowances on mortgage loans decreased $19, largely driven by the foreclosure of a loan. Following the conclusion of the loan's foreclosure process, the property transferred at its carrying value, net of the valuation allowance, to a real-estate owned investment during 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, there was no change in valuation allowances on mortgage loans.\nMunicipal Bonds\nThe following table presents the Company's exposure to municipal bonds by type and weighted average credit quality included in the preceding Securities by Type tables.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Credit Quality\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Credit Quality\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Obligation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-Refunded [1]\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AAA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health Care\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water & Sewer\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Education\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales Tax\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing [2]\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Housing\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenue\n</td> <td>927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Municipal\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n[1] Pre-Refunded bonds are bonds for which an irrevocable trust containing sufficient U.S. treasury, agency, or other securities has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest.\n[2] Leasing revenue bonds are generally the obligations of a financing authority established by the municipality that leases facilities back to a municipality. The notes are typically secured by lease payments made by the municipality that is leasing the facilities financed by the issue. Lease payments may be subject to annual appropriation by the municipality or the municipality may be obligated to appropriate general tax revenues to make lease payments.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the largest issuer concentrations were the state of California, the Oregon School Boards Association, and Ohio American Municipal Power, Inc., which each comprised less than 6% of the municipal bond portfolio and were comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds.\nLimited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments\nThe following table presents the Company's investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments which include hedge funds, real estate funds, and private equity funds. Since December 31, 2015, the Company has reduced the allocation to hedge funds. Real estate funds consist of investments primarily in real estate equity funds and joint ventures, including some funds with public market exposure. Private equity funds primarily consist of investments in funds whose assets typically consist of a diversified pool of investments in small to mid-sized non-public businesses with high growth potential as well as limited exposure to public markets.\nLimited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments Investment Income\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Yield\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Yield\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hedge funds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate funds\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private equity and other funds\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestments in Limited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hedge funds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate funds\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private equity and other funds\n</td> <td>701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities - Unrealized Loss Aging\nTotal gross unrealized losses were $73 as of December 31, 2017, and have improved $133, or 65%, from December 31, 2016, due to tighter credit spreads. As of December 31, 2017, $71 of the gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The remaining $2 of gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed greater than 20%. The securities depressed more than 20% are primarily securities with exposure to commercial real estate and corporate securities in the energy sector that decreased in value primarily due to wider credit spreads since the securities were purchased.\nAs part of the Company's ongoing security monitoring process, the Company has reviewed its AFS securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that these securities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the securities approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. For these securities in an unrealized loss position where a credit impairment has not been recorded, the Company's best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities. For further information regarding the Company's impairment analysis, see Other-Than-Temporary Impairments in the Investment Portfolio Risks and Risk Management section of this MD&A.\nThe following tables present the Company's unrealized loss aging for AFS securities by length of time the security was in a continuous unrealized loss position.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

$14. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there were no securities that the Company intends to sell (\"intent-to-sell impairments\") or impairments on equity securities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, credit impairments were primarily related to two corporate securities and were identified through security specific reviews and resulted from changes in the financial condition of the issuers. The Company incorporates its best estimate of future performance using internal assumptions and judgments that are informed by economic and industry specific trends, as well as our expectations with respect to security specific developments.\nNon-credit impairments recognized in other comprehensive income were $2 for the year ended December 31, 2017. These non-credit impairments represent the excess of the Company's best estimate of the discounted future cash flows over the fair value.\nFuture impairments may develop as the result of changes in intent-to-sell specific securities or if actual results underperform current modeling assumptions, which may be the result of, but are not limited to, macroeconomic factors and security-specific performance below current expectations.\nYear ended December 31, 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, impairments recognized in earnings were comprised of intent-to-sell impairments of $4 and credit impairments of $22, both of which were primarily concentrated in corporate securities. Also, impairments recognized in earnings included impairments on equity securities of $2 that were in an unrealized loss position and the Company no longer believed the securities would recover in the foreseeable future.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nCapital resources and liquidity represent the overall strength of Hartford Life Insurance Company and its ability to generate strong cash flows, borrow funds at competitive rates and to meet operating needs over the next twelve months.\nLiquidity Requirements and Sources of Capital\nThe Hartford has an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ( HFSG Holding Company\u201d) and certain affiliates of up to $2.0 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Connecticut Insurance Department (\"CTDOI\") granted approval for certain affiliated insurance companies that are parties to the agreement to treat receivables from a parent, including the HFSG Holding Company, as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding from the HFSG Holding Company.\nDerivative Commitments\nCertain of the Company's derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity's financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity's ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2017, was $692. Of this $692 the legal entities have posted collateral of $847, which is inclusive of initial margin requirements, in the normal course of business. In addition, the Company has posted collateral of $31 associated with a customized GMWB derivative. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2017, a downgrade of one or two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody's or S&P would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. These collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the collateral that we would post, if required, would be primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and government agency securities.\nOn October 23, 2017, Moody's lowered its counterparty credit and insurer financial strength ratings on Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company to Baa3. Given this downgrade action, termination rating triggers in two derivative counterparty relationships in which the Company has open derivative contracts were impacted. The Company has successfully re-negotiated the rating triggers with these counterparties. Accordingly, the Company does not expect the current hedging programs to be adversely impacted by the announcement of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company. In addition, as a result of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, the Company is required to post an additional $9 of collateral related to a single counterparty relationship.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of derivative relationships that could be subject to immediate termination in the event of a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings was $1.5 billion and $12, respectively. These amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated.\nInsurance Operations\nTotal general account contractholder obligations are supported by $30 billion of cash and total general account invested assets to meet liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's fixed maturities, short-term investments, and cash are summarized as follows: Table 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash\n</td> <td>537\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Derivative collateral\n</td> <td>1,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital resources available to fund liquidity upon contractholder surrender or termination are a function of the legal entity in which the liquidity requirement resides. Obligations related to life and annuity insurance products will be generally funded by both HLIC and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company (\"HLAI\"); obligations related to retirement and institutional investment products will be generally funded by HLIC.\nThe Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ( FHLBB\u201d). Membership allows the Company access to collateralized advances, which may be used to support various spread-based business and enhance liquidity management. FHLBB membership requires the company to own member stock and advances require the purchase of activity stock. The amount of advances that can be taken are dependent on the asset types pledged to secure the advances. The Connecticut Department of Insurance ( CTDOI\u201d) will permit the Company to pledge up to $0.9 billion in qualifying assets to secure FHLBB advances for 2018. The pledge limit is recalculated annually based on statutory admitted assets and capital and surplus. The Company would need to seek the prior approval of the CTDOI in order to exceed these limits. As of December 31, 2017, HLIC had no advances outstanding under the FHLBB facility.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractholder Obligations\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractholder obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Separate account assets [1]\n</td> <td>115,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General account contractholder obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Composition of General Account Contractholder Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracts without a surrender provision and/or fixed payout dates [2]\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed MVA annuities [3]\n</td> <td>4,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other [4]\n</td> <td>20,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General account contractholder obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[1]\n</td> <td>In the event customers elect to surrender separate account assets, the Company will use the proceeds from the sale of the assets to fund the surrender, and the Company's liquidity position will not be impacted.

In the event assets decline in value at a greater rate than the MVA surrender value of the Fixed MVA contract, the Company is required to contribute additional capital to the statutory separate account. The Company will fund these required contributions with operating cash flows or short-term investments. In the event that operating cash flows or short-term investments are not sufficient to fund required contributions, the Company may have to sell other invested assets at a loss, potentially resulting in a decrease in statutory surplus. As the fair value of invested assets in the statutory separate account are at least equal to the MVA surrender value of the Fixed MVA contract, surrender of Fixed MVA annuities will have an insignificant impact on the liquidity requirements of the Company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[4]\n</td> <td>Surrenders of, or policy loans taken from, as applicable, these general account liabilities, may be funded through operating cash flows of the Company, available short-term investments, or the Company may be required to sell fixed maturity investments to fund the surrender payment.

Sales of fixed maturity investments could result in the recognition of significant realized losses and insufficient proceeds to fully fund the surrender amount. In this circumstance, the Company may need to take other actions, including enforcing certain contract provisions which could restrict surrenders and/or slow or defer payouts. The Company has ceded reinsurance in connection with the sales of its Retirement Plans and Individual Life businesses to MassMutual and Prudential, respectively. The reinsurance transactions do not extinguish the Company's primary liability on the insurance policies issued under these businesses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources of the Company, except for unfunded commitments to purchase investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, private placements, and mortgage loans of $787 as disclosed in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017: Table 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>More\nthan\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life and annuity obligations [1]\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations [2]\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations [3]\n</td> <td>956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities reflected on the balance sheet [4]\n</td> <td>1,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>[1]\n</td> <td>Estimated life and annuity obligations include death claims, other charges associated with policyholder reserves, policy surrenders and policyholder dividends, offset by expected future deposits on in-force contracts.

The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer's policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer's earned surplus or certain other thresholds as calculated under applicable state insurance law, the dividend requires the prior approval of the domestic regulator. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiary, regulatory capital requirements and liquidity requirements of the individual operating company.\nIn 2017, HLIC paid dividends of $1.4 billion of which $800 was a return of capital used by The Hartford to help fund Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company's (\"HLA\") acquisition of the Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business. $550 of the $800 return of capital was funded through an extraordinary dividend from HLAI to the Company and approved by the CTDOI.\nOn December 4, 2017, The Hartford announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Company's parent, Hartford Life Inc., to a group of investors led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial Group, Pine Brook and J. Safara Group. Prior to the expected close in 2018, the Company anticipates paying an additional $300 in dividends to its parent, subject to approval by the CTDOI. The sale is anticipated to close by June 30, 2018, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.\nCash Flows Table 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>682\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,280\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,399\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,081\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash - end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to decreases in claims and benefits paid as well as a decrease in operating expenses, largely offset by a decrease in fee income and federal income tax refunds.\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2017 primarily relates to net proceeds from available-for-sale securities of approximately $1.6 billion. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2016 primarily relates to net proceeds from available-for-sale securities of approximately $1.5 billion, partially offset by net payments for short-term investments of $769.

Net cash used for financing activities in 2016 relates to net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investment and universal life-type contracts of approximately $0.9 billion and the return of capital to the parent of approximately $0.8 billion. Net cash used for financing activities in 2015 relates to the return of capital to the parent of approximately $1.0 billion and net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investment and universal life-type contracts of approximately $1.3 billion.\nOperating cash flows in all periods have been adequate to meet liquidity requirements.\nRatings\nRatings can have an impact on the Company's reinsurance and derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company's ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company's ratings are downgraded, reinsurance contracts may be adversely impacted and the Company may be required to post additional collateral on certain derivative contracts.\nOn October 23, 2017, Moody's Investor Service downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life & Annuity Insurance Company to Baa3 from Baa2.\nThe following ratings actions were announced in connection with The Hartford's definitive agreement to sell Hartford Life Inc. and its life and annuity operating subsidiaries, Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company.\nOn December 4, 2017, Moody's Investors Service placed its ratings for Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, both rated Baa3 for insurance financial strength, under review for further downgrade, and downgraded the senior debt rating of Hartford Life, Inc. to Ba3 from Baa2 with a continuing review for downgrade.\nOn December 4, 2017, S&P Global Ratings lowered its issuer credit rating on Hartford Life Inc. to BB/B from BBB/A-2. At the same time, they lowered the issuer and financial strength ratings on Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company to BBB from BBB+. The above ratings were placed on CreditWatch with Negative implications.\nOn December 5, 2017, A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength rating to B++ (Good) from A- (Excellent) and the long-term issuer credit ratings to bbb+ from a- of Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company. Additionally, A.M. Best downgraded the long-term issuer credit rating to bbb- from bbb of Hartford Life Inc. Concurrently, A.M.

One consideration is the relative level of statutory capital and surplus, (referred to collectively as \"statutory capital\") necessary to support the business written and is reported in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the applicable state insurance department.\nStatutory Capital\nThe Company's stockholder's equity, as prepared using U.S. GAAP, was $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. The Company's estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus, as prepared in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual ( U.S. STAT\u201d), was $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nSignificant differences between U.S. GAAP stockholder's equity and aggregate statutory capital prepared in accordance with U.S. STAT include the following:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Costs incurred by the Company to acquire insurance policies are deferred under U.S. GAAP while those costs are expensed immediately under U.S. STAT.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Temporary differences between the book and tax basis of an asset or liability which are recorded as deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability under U.S. GAAP while those amounts deferred are subject to limitations under U.S. STAT.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The assumptions used in the determination of benefit reserves are prescribed under U.S. STAT, while the assumptions used under U.S. GAAP are generally the Company's best estimates. The methodologies for determining life insurance reserve amounts are also different. For example, reserving for living benefit reserves under U.S. STAT is generally addressed by the Commissioners' Annuity Reserving Valuation Methodology and the related Actuarial Guidelines, while under U.S. GAAP, those same living benefits are either embedded derivatives recorded at fair value or are recorded as additional minimum guarantee benefit reserves. The sensitivity of these life insurance reserves to changes in equity markets, as applicable, will be different between U.S. GAAP and U.S. STAT.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The difference between the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity and other investments, net of tax, is recorded as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the related asset and to equity under U.S. GAAP, while U.S. STAT only records certain securities at fair value, such as equity securities and certain lower rated bonds required by the NAIC to be recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>U.S. STAT for life insurance companies establishes a formula reserve for realized and unrealized losses due to default and equity risks associated with certain invested assets (the Asset Valuation Reserve), while U.S. GAAP does not.

U.S. GAAP generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.\nRisk-based Capital\nThe Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose risk-based capital ( RBC\u201d) requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, based on its size and risk profile. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's total adjusted capital ( TAC\u201d) to its authorized control level RBC ( ACL RBC\u201d). Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The minimum level of TAC before corrective action commences ( Company Action Level\u201d) is two times the ACL RBC. The adequacy of a company's capital is determined by the ratio of a company's TAC to its Company Action Level, known as the \"RBC ratio\". The Company and all of its operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations. The RBC ratios for the Company and its principal life insurance operating subsidiaries were all in excess of 300% of their Company Action Levels as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The reporting of RBC ratios is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company, or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities.\nContingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFor further information on other contingencies, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\nTax Reform\nAt the end of 2017, Congress passed and the president signed, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\"), which enacted significant reforms to the U.S. tax code. The major areas of interest to the Company include the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and the refunding of AMT credits. We continue to analyze Tax Reform for other potential impacts. The U.S. Treasury and IRS will develop guidance implementing Tax Reform, and Congress may consider additional technical corrections to the legislation. Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by Congress and/or the U.S. Treasury Department could have a material effect on the Company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear. For additional information on risks to the Company related to Tax Reform, please see the risk factor entitled \"Changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity\" under \"Risk Factors\" in Part I.\nGuaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments\nFor a discussion regarding Guaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nFor a discussion of accounting standards, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>", "item_7_truncated": "\nFor further information on other contingencies, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Variable Annuity Guarantees as of December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in billions)\n</td> <td>Account Value\n</td> <td>Gross Net Amount at Risk\n</td> <td>Retained Net Amount at Risk\n</td> <td>% of Contracts In the Money[2]\n</td> <td>% In the Money[2][3]\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable Annuity [1]\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMDB [4]\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments related to the businesses included in the table above was $18.0 billion and $18.3 billion, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The assets supporting the fixed liabilities are monitored and managed within set duration guidelines, and are evaluated on a daily basis, as well as annually using scenario simulation techniques in compliance with regulatory requirements.\nUnder the dynamic hedging program, the Company enters into derivative contracts to hedge market risk exposures associated with the GMWB liabilities that are not reinsured. These derivative contracts include customized swaps, interest rate swaps and futures, and equity swaps, options, and futures, on certain indices including the S&P 500 index, EAFE index, and NASDAQ index.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP Sensitivity Analysis (before tax and DAC) as of December 31, 2017 [1]\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>GMWB\n</td> <td>Macro\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity Market Return\n</td> <td>-20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>-10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>-20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>-10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Potential Net Fair Value Impact\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Rates\n</td> <td>-50bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-25bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+25bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-50bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-25bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+25bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Potential Net Fair Value Impact\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Implied Volatilities\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>-10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>-10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Potential Net Fair Value Impact\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(72\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(77\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 The difference between the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity and other investments, net of tax, is recorded as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the related asset and to equity under U.S. GAAP, while U.S. STAT only records certain securities at fair value, such as equity securities and certain lower rated bonds required by the NAIC to be recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. \n [1] Amortized cost represents carrying value prior to valuation allowances, if any.  During 2017, the Company funded $389 of commercial whole loans with a weighted average loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) ratio of 70% and a weighted average yield of 3.9%. The Company continues to originate commercial whole loans within primary markets, such as office, industrial and multi-family, focusing on loans with strong LTV ratios and high quality property collateral. There were no mortgage loans held for sale as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.\nThe preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ, and in the past have differed, from those estimates.\nInterest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk encompasses exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. Interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads.\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources of the Company, except for unfunded commitments to purchase investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, private placements, and mortgage loans of $787 as disclosed in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn 2017, HLIC paid dividends of $1.4 billion of which $800 was a return of capital used by The Hartford to help fund Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company's (\"HLA\") acquisition of the Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business. $550 of the $800 return of capital was funded through an extraordinary dividend from HLAI to the Company and approved by the CTDOI.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>More\nthan\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life and annuity obligations [1]\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations [2]\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations [3]\n</td> <td>956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities reflected on the balance sheet [4]\n</td> <td>1,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 23, 2017, Moody's lowered its counterparty credit and insurer financial strength ratings on Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company to Baa3. Given this downgrade action, termination rating triggers in two derivative counterparty relationships in which the Company has open derivative contracts were impacted. The Company has successfully re-negotiated the rating triggers with these counterparties. Accordingly, the Company does not expect the current hedging programs to be adversely impacted by the announcement of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company. In addition, as a result of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, the Company is required to post an additional $9 of collateral related to a single counterparty relationship.\nStatutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease in any period depending upon a variety of factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. In general, as equity market levels and interest rates decline, the amount and volatility of both our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin can be materially negatively affected, sometimes at a greater than linear rate. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. Factors include:\n \u2022 Rising equity markets will generally result in an increase in statutory surplus and RBC ratios. However, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and RBC requirements could increase with rising equity markets, resulting in lower RBC ratios. The Company has reinsured approximately 43% of its risk associated with GMWB and 81% of its risk associated with the aggregate GMDB exposure. These reinsurance agreements reduce the Company's exposure to changes in the statutory reserves and the related capital and RBC ratios associated with changes in the capital markets. \nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge to Income, Net of Tax, as a Result of Unlock\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DAC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Death and Other Insurance Benefit Reserves\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (pre-tax)\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax effect\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (after-tax)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 A decrease in the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, due in part to credit spreads widening, may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and RBC ratios. \nThe following table presents the Company's exposure to CMBS bonds by current credit quality and vintage year included in the preceding Securities by Type table.

Interest rate swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flow of a forecasted purchase or sale of fixed rate securities due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk, including offsetting positions, totaled $4.7 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, related to investments and $34 and $100, respectively, related to liabilities. The fair value of these derivatives was $(356) and $(404) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts do not include derivatives associated with the Variable Annuity Hedging Program.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consecutive Months\n</td> <td>Items\n</td> <td>Cost or\nAmortized\nCost\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>Unrealized\nLoss\n</td> <td>Items\n</td> <td>Cost or\nAmortized\nCost\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>Unrealized\nLoss\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than three to six months\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than six to nine months\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than nine to eleven months\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twelve months or more\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Services\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities, available-for-sale (\"AFS\"), at fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities, at fair value using the fair value option (\"FVO\")\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities, AFS, at fair value\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>2,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans, at outstanding balance\n</td> <td>1,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Limited partnerships and other alternative investments\n</td> <td>1,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments [1]\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nValuation Allowances on Mortgage Loans\n\nThe Company has defined ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to assess liquidity across the enterprise under both current and stressed market conditions.

Estimated life and annuity obligations are based on mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with the Company's historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. The Company has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with other assumptions. In contrast to this table, the majority of the Company's obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth, interest crediting, or future deposits. Therefore, the estimated obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits, other policyholder funds and benefits payable, and separate account liabilities.

Also, for those realized gains and losses caused by changes in interest rates, U.S. STAT for life insurance companies defers and amortizes the gains and losses, caused by changes in interest rates, into income over the original life to maturity of the asset sold (the Interest Maintenance Reserve) while U.S. GAAP does not.  In addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under U.S. STAT. U.S. GAAP generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.\nThe Company's macro hedging program uses derivative instruments, such as options and futures on equities and interest rates, to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from GMWB and GMDB liabilities on the Company's statutory surplus. These macro hedges cover some of the residual risks not otherwise covered by the dynamic hedging program. Management assesses this residual risk under various scenarios in designing and executing the macro hedge program. The macro hedge program will result in additional U.S. GAAP earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory reserve and capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in U.S. GAAP liabilities.\nFair values for GMWBs classified as embedded derivatives and included in other policyholder funds and benefits payable, are calculated using the income approach based upon internally developed models, because active, observable markets do not exist for those items. The fair value of these GMWBs and the related reinsurance and customized freestanding derivatives are calculated as an aggregation of the following components: Best Estimate Claim Payments; Credit Standing Adjustment; and Margins. The resulting aggregation is reconciled or calibrated, if necessary, to market information that is, or may be, available to the Company, but may not be observable by other market participants, including reinsurance discussions and transactions. The Company believes the aggregation of these components, as calibrated to the market information, results in an amount that the Company would be required to transfer to or receive from market participants in an active liquid market, if one existed, for those market participants to assume the risks associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits and the related reinsurance and customized derivatives. The fair value is likely to materially diverge from the ultimate settlement of the liability as the Company believes settlement will be based on our best estimate assumptions rather than those best estimate assumptions plus risk margins. In the absence of any transfer of the guaranteed benefit liability to a third party, the release of risk margins is likely to be reflected as realized gains in future periods' net income.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hedge funds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate funds\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private equity and other funds\n</td> <td>701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents the Company's exposure to municipal bonds by type and weighted average credit quality included in the preceding Securities by Type tables.\nThese ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of the Company's securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization.\nOn December 4, 2017, Moody's Investors Service placed its ratings for Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, both rated Baa3 for insurance financial strength, under review for further downgrade, and downgraded the senior debt rating of Hartford Life, Inc. to Ba3 from Baa2 with a continuing review for downgrade.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>Net Unrealized Gain/(Loss)\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>Net Unrealized Gain/(Loss)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A\n</td> <td>1,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB\n</td> <td>836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BB & below\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total [1]\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet realized capital losses decreased primarily due to the effect of transactional foreign currency revaluation, higher net gains on sales and lower impairments, partially offset by greater losses on non-qualifying foreign currency derivatives and the variable annuity hedge program.

While some economic conditions have improved, sluggish wage growth points towards continued accommodative monetary policy throughout Europe in 2018.

The Company currently transacts OTC derivatives in two legal entities that have a threshold greater than zero. The maximum combined threshold for a single counterparty across all legal entities that use derivatives is $10. In addition, the Company may have exposure to multiple counterparties in a single corporate family due to a common credit support provider; however, the thresholds for these relationships are zero. Based on the contractual terms of the collateral agreements, these thresholds may be immediately reduced due to a downgrade in either party's credit rating.

There can be no assurance that the Company's ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company's ratings are downgraded, reinsurance contracts may be adversely impacted and the Company may be required to post additional collateral on certain derivative contracts.\nMost of the Company's variable annuities include GMDB and certain contracts with GMDB also include GMWB features. Declines in the equity markets will increase the Company's liability for these benefits. Many contracts with a GMDB include a maximum anniversary value (\"MAV\"), which in rising markets resets the guarantee on the anniversary to be 'at the money'. As the MAV increases, it can increase the NAR for subsequent declines in account value. Generally, a GMWB contract is \u2018in the money' if the contractholder's guaranteed remaining balance (\"GRB\") becomes greater than the account value.\nThe following table provides an analysis showing the estimated before-tax change in the fair value of the Company's investments and related derivatives, excluding assets supporting fixed liabilities which are included in the table above, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments.\nStatutory Capital\nCybersecurity Risk\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consecutive Months\n</td> <td>Items\n</td> <td>Cost or\nAmortized\nCost\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>Unrealized\nLoss\n</td> <td>Items\n</td> <td>Cost or\nAmortized\nCost\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>Unrealized\nLoss\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(95\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than three to six months\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than six to nine months\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than nine to eleven months\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twelve months or more\n</td> <td>379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(206\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 valuation of investments and derivative instruments including evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities and valuation allowances on mortgage loans; \nThe following table presents the Company's investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments which include hedge funds, real estate funds, and private equity funds.

Private equity funds primarily consist of investments in funds whose assets typically consist of a diversified pool of investments in small to mid-sized non-public businesses with high growth potential as well as limited exposure to public markets.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Credit Quality\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Credit Quality\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Obligation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-Refunded [1]\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AAA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health Care\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water & Sewer\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Education\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales Tax\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing [2]\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Housing\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenue\n</td> <td>927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Municipal\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, credit impairments were primarily related to two corporate securities and were identified through security specific reviews and resulted from changes in the financial condition of the issuers. The Company incorporates its best estimate of future performance using internal assumptions and judgments that are informed by economic and industry specific trends, as well as our expectations with respect to security specific developments.\nThe Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a \"waterfall\" approach comprised of the following pricing sources which are listed in priority order: quoted prices, prices from third-party pricing services, internal matrix pricing, and independent broker quotes. The fair value of free-standing derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded transactions and transactions cleared through central clearing houses (\"OTC-cleared\") may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used.

In many instances the Company will receive a percentage of the surrender amount as compensation for early surrender (surrender charge), increasing the Company's liquidity position. In addition, a surrender of variable annuity separate account or general account assets (see the following) will decrease the Company's obligation for payments on guaranteed living and death benefits. \n \u2022 The sensitivity analysis is only valid as of the measurement date and assumes instantaneous changes in the capital market factors and no ability to rebalance hedge positions prior to the market changes; \nResponsibility for day-to-day management of operational risk lies within each business unit and functional area. ERM provides an enterprise-wide view of the Company's operational risk on an aggregate basis. ERM is responsible for establishing, maintaining and communicating the framework, principles and guidelines of the Company's operational risk management program. Operational risk mitigation strategies include the following:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Yield\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Yield\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hedge funds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate funds\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private equity and other funds\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n [1] Contracts with a guaranteed living benefit also have a guaranteed death benefit. The NAR for each benefit is shown; however these benefits are not additive. When a contract terminates due to death, any NAR related to GMWB is released. Similarly, when a contract goes into benefit status on a GMWB, the GMDB NAR is reduced to zero. \nOperational Risk\nFor a discussion of accounting standards, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 Non-market factors, which can also impact the amount and volatility of both our actual potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin, include actual and estimated policyholder behavior experience as it pertains to lapsation, partial withdrawals, and mortality.  Most of these factors are outside of the Company's control. The Company's financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by its statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer, or counterparty greater than 10% of the Company's stockholder's equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government securities. For further discussion of concentration of credit risk in the investment portfolio, see the Concentration of Credit Risk section in Note 3 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 Credit spreads on invested assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. As actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in the current crediting rates, the calculation of statutory reserves for fixed MVA annuities will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. \nThe NAR is generally defined as the guaranteed minimum benefit amount in excess of the contractholder's current account value. Variable annuity account values with guarantee features were $40.8 billion and $40.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n \u2022 risk monitoring; and \nContingencies\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nCapital resources available to fund liquidity upon contractholder surrender or termination are a function of the legal entity in which the liquidity requirement resides. Obligations related to life and annuity insurance products will be generally funded by both HLIC and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company (\"HLAI\"); obligations related to retirement and institutional investment products will be generally funded by HLIC.\nThe Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction. Downgrades to the credit ratings of the Company's insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives including those used to hedge benefit guarantees of variable annuities. In some cases, downgrades may give derivative counterparties for over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives and clearing brokers for OTC-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. In addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require collateralization before entering into any new trades. This would restrict the supply of derivative instruments commonly used to hedge variable annuity guarantees, particularly long-dated equity derivatives and interest rate swaps.\nAsset accumulation vehicles primarily require a fixed rate payment, often for a specified period of time, and fixed rate annuities contain surrender values that are based upon a market value adjusted formula if held for shorter periods. In addition, certain products such as corporate owned life insurance contracts and the general account portion of variable annuity products credit interest to policyholders subject to market conditions and minimum interest rate guarantees. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $4,728 and $5,187, respectively, of liabilities for fixed annuities and $120 and $194, respectively, of liabilities for guaranteed investment products.\nVariable Annuity Hedging Program\nFinancial risks include direct and indirect risks to the Company's financial objectives coming from events that impact market conditions or prices. Some events may cause correlated movement in multiple risk factors. The primary sources of financial risks are the Company's general account assets and the liabilities and the guarantees which the company has written over various liability products, particularly its fixed and variable annuity guarantees. Consistent with its risk appetite, the Company establishes financial risk limits to control potential loss on a U.S. GAAP, statutory, and economic basis. Exposures are actively monitored, and mitigated where appropriate. The Company uses various risk management strategies, including reinsurance and over-the-counter and exchange traded derivatives with counterparties meeting the appropriate regulatory and due diligence requirements. Derivatives are utilized to achieve one of four Company-approved objectives: hedging risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; managing liquidity; controlling transaction costs; or entering into synthetic replication transactions. Derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the Company's compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management.\n \u2022 Gross gains and losses on sales were primarily the result of duration, liquidity and credit management within corporate securities, equity securities and U.S Treasuries for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  Variable Annuity Hedge Program\nFee income, earned premiums, and insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased primarily due to the continued run-off of the variable annuity block of business.\n \u2022 Differences in performance of variable subaccounts relative to indices and/or realized equity and interest rate volatilities may affect RBC ratios. \n \u2022 Changes to the underlying hedging program, policyholder behavior, and variation in underlying fund performance relative to the hedged index, which could materially impact the liability; and \nOn October 23, 2017, Moody's Investor Service downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life & Annuity Insurance Company to Baa3 from Baa2.\nInadequate capital resources and liquidity could negatively affect the Company's overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows from its businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.\n [1] For additional information on DAC, see Note 6 - Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n [2] Includes net investment income on short-term investments. \nEach quarter, a committee of investment and accounting professionals evaluates investments to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment ( impairment\u201d) is present for AFS securities or a valuation allowance is required for mortgage loans. This evaluation is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. For further discussion of the accounting policies, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of impairments recorded, see the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments within the Investment Portfolio Risks and Risk Management section of the MD&A.\nInvestment Portfolio Risk\nThe following tables summarize the account values of the Company's variable annuities with guarantee features and the NAR split between various guarantee features (retained net amount at risk does not take into consideration the effects of the variable annuity hedge programs currently in place as of each balance sheet date).\nReinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy\nThe Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by constructing investment portfolios that maintain asset allocation limits and asset/liability duration matching targets which may include the use of derivatives. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models and cash flows simulation under various market scenarios of the liabilities and their supporting investment portfolios. Key metrics that the Company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities include duration, convexity and key rate duration.\nOn December 5, 2017, A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength rating to B++ (Good) from A- (Excellent) and the long-term issuer credit ratings to bbb+ from a- of Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company. Additionally, A.M. Best downgraded the long-term issuer credit rating to bbb- from bbb of Hartford Life Inc. Concurrently, A.M. Best has placed all credit ratings for these entities under review with developing implications.\n\nThe Company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability:\nGuaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments\nAdditionally, the Company holds customized derivative contracts to provide protection from certain capital market risks for the remaining term of specified blocks of non-reinsured GMWB riders. These customized derivative contracts are based on policyholder behavior assumptions specified at the inception of the derivative contracts. The Company retains the risk for differences between assumed and actual policyholder behavior and between the performance of the actively managed funds underlying the separate accounts and their respective indices.\nUse of Credit Derivatives\nInvestments in Limited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments\nInvested Assets Not Supporting Fixed Liabilities\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nwhich oversees controls for the Company's major risk exposures. The topics covered by these updates include The Hartford's activities, policies and procedures to prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, as well as lessons learned from cybersecurity incidents and internal and external testing of our protection measures. FIRMCo meets at each regular Board meeting and is briefed on cyber risks at least annually.\nTax Reform\nThe Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ( FHLBB\u201d). Membership allows the Company access to collateralized advances, which may be used to support various spread-based business and enhance liquidity management. FHLBB membership requires the company to own member stock and advances require the purchase of activity stock. The amount of advances that can be taken are dependent on the asset types pledged to secure the advances. The Connecticut Department of Insurance ( CTDOI\u201d) will permit the Company to pledge up to $0.9 billion in qualifying assets to secure FHLBB advances for 2018. The pledge limit is recalculated annually based on statutory admitted assets and capital and surplus. The Company would need to seek the prior approval of the CTDOI in order to exceed these limits. As of December 31, 2017, HLIC had no advances outstanding under the FHLBB facility.\nTotal general account contractholder obligations are supported by $30 billion of cash and total general account invested assets to meet liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's fixed maturities, short-term investments, and cash are summarized as follows: \nTotal net investment income decreased primarily due to lower asset levels as well as lower income received from previously impaired securities.\nChanges in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities. Based on the fair values of the Company's non-U.S. dollar denominated securities and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, management estimates that a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by an immaterial amount.\n\nWhile the Company actively manages this dynamic hedging program, increased U.S. GAAP earnings volatility may result from factors including, but not limited to: policyholder behavior, capital markets, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, changes in hedging positions and the relative emphasis placed on various risk management objectives.\n\nAfter each quarterly Unlock, the Company also tests the aggregate recoverability of DAC by comparing the DAC balance to the present value of future EGPs. The margin between the DAC balance and the present value of future EGPs for variable annuities was 35% as of December 31, 2017. If the margin between the DAC asset and the present value of future EGPs is exhausted, then further reductions in EGPs would cause portions of DAC to be unrecoverable and the DAC asset would be written down to equal future EGPs.\n \u2022 internal and external risk reporting.  The Company categorizes its main risks as insurance risk, operational risk and financial risk.\n\n [3] Relates to annuities that are recorded in the general account under U.S. GAAP as the contractholders are subject to the Company's credit risk, although these annuities are held in a statutory separate account. In the statutory separate account, the Company is required to maintain invested assets with a fair value greater than or equal to the MVA surrender value of the Fixed MVA contract. In the event assets decline in value at a greater rate than the MVA surrender value of the Fixed MVA contract, the Company is required to contribute additional capital to the statutory separate account. The Company will fund these required contributions with operating cash flows or short-term investments. In the event that operating cash flows or short-term investments are not sufficient to fund required contributions, the Company may have to sell other invested assets at a loss, potentially resulting in a decrease in statutory surplus. As the fair value of invested assets in the statutory separate account are at least equal to the MVA surrender value of the Fixed MVA contract, surrender of Fixed MVA annuities will have an insignificant impact on the liquidity requirements of the Company. \n [2] For additional information on death and other insurance benefit reserves, see Note 7 - Reserves for Future Policy Benefits and Separate Account Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe Unlock charge, after-tax, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to updates to the macro hedging program cost assumption to reflect 2017 activity, and the effect of updates for variable annuities, including a reduction to the assumed general account investment rates, largely offset by separate account returns being above our aggregated estimated returns during the period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the valuation allowances on mortgage loans decreased $19, largely driven by the foreclosure of a loan. Following the conclusion of the loan's foreclosure process, the property transferred at its carrying value, net of the valuation allowance, to a real-estate owned investment during 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, there was no change in valuation allowances on mortgage loans.\n\u2022Identifying and monitoring emerging risks; and\n \u2022 Investing in a portfolio of high-quality and diverse securities; \nThe following tables present the Company's unrealized loss aging for AFS securities by length of time the security was in a continuous unrealized loss position.\nThe Hartford has implemented an information protection program with established governance routines that promote an adaptive approach for assessing and managing risks. The Hartford has invested to build a \u2018defense-in-depth' strategy that uses multiple security measures to protect the integrity of the Company's information assets. This \u2018defense-in-depth' strategy aligns to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework and provides preventative, detective and responsive measures that collectively protects the company. Various cyber assurance methods, including security metrics, third party security assessments, external penetration testing, red team exercises, and cyber war game exercises are used to test the effectiveness of the overall cybersecurity control environment.\nThe following table summarizes the broad Variable Annuity Guarantees offered by the Company and the market risks to which the guarantee is most exposed from a U.S. GAAP accounting perspective.\n\nOn December 4, 2017, The Hartford announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Company's parent, Hartford Life Inc., to a group of investors led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial Group, Pine Brook and J. Safara Group. Prior to the expected close in 2018, the Company anticipates paying an additional $300 in dividends to its parent, subject to approval by the CTDOI. The sale is anticipated to close by June 30, 2018, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.\nThe Company's exposure to equity risk includes the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of its businesses such as variable annuities where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. Declines in equity markets may also decrease the value of limited partnerships and other alternative investments. In addition, the Company offers certain guaranteed benefits, primarily associated with variable annuity products, which increases the Company's potential benefit exposure in periods that equity markets decline. For further discussion of equity risk, see the Managing Equity Risk on Variable Annuity Products section.\nThe annualized net investment income yield, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, decreased slightly to 4.4% in 2017, versus 4.5% in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower income from previously impaired securities as well as lower make-whole payment income on fixed maturities and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans.\nOn December 4, 2017, S&P Global Ratings lowered its issuer credit rating on Hartford Life Inc. to BB/B from BBB/A-2. At the same time, they lowered the issuer and financial strength ratings on Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company to BBB from BBB+. The above ratings were placed on CreditWatch with Negative implications.\n\u2022Conducting business risk assessments and implementing action plans where necessary;\n \u2022 Clearing transactions through central clearing houses that require daily variation margin; \n [4] Includes contracts that had a GMDB at issue but no longer have a GMDB due to certain elections made by policyholders or their beneficiaries. Such contracts had $1.9 billion of account value as of September 30, 2017 and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2016.  Many policyholders with a GMDB also have a GMWB. Policyholders that have a product that offers both guarantees can only receive the GMDB or GMWB. The GMDB NAR disclosed in the preceding tables is a point in time measurement and assumes that all participants utilize the GMDB on that measurement date.\nThe Company utilizes reinsurance to transfer risk to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers. Reinsurance is used to transfer certain risk to reinsurance companies based on specific risk concentrations. All reinsurance processes are aligned under a single enterprise reinsurance risk management policy. Reinsurance purchasing is a centralized function across The Hartford to support a consistent strategy and to ensure that the reinsurance activities are fully integrated into the organization's risk management processes.\nFor further discussion on liquidity see the section on Capital Resources and Liquidity.\nFor most variable annuity contracts, the Company estimates gross profits over 20 years as EGPs emerging subsequent to that time frame are immaterial. Contracts sold in a particular year are aggregated into cohorts. Future gross profits for each cohort are projected over the estimated lives of the underlying contracts, based on future account value projections for variable annuity products. The projection of future account values requires the use of certain assumptions including: separate account returns; separate account fund mix; fees assessed against the contract holder's account balance; full and partial surrender rates; interest credited; mortality; and the extent and duration of hedging activities and hedging costs. Changes in these assumptions and changes to other policyholder behavior assumptions such as GMWB utilization, reaction to price increases, and asset allocations cause EGPs to fluctuate which impacts earnings.\nInsurance operating costs and expenses decreased largely due to the run off of the business requiring less staff and other operating expenses.\nMacro Hedge Program\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the largest issuer concentrations were the state of California, the Oregon School Boards Association, and Ohio American Municipal Power, Inc., which each comprised less than 6% of the municipal bond portfolio and were comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds.\nLimited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments Investment Income\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nMunicipal Bonds\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2017 relates to net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investment and universal life-type contracts of approximately $1.2 billion and the return of capital to the parent of approximately $1.4 billion, partially offset by a $360 net increase in securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Net cash used for financing activities in 2016 relates to net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investment and universal life-type contracts of approximately $0.9 billion and the return of capital to the parent of approximately $0.8 billion. Net cash used for financing activities in 2015 relates to the return of capital to the parent of approximately $1.0 billion and net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investment and universal life-type contracts of approximately $1.3 billion.\nThe new money yield, excluding certain U.S. Treasury securities and cash equivalent securities, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 3.6%, which was below the average yield of sales and maturities of 3.8% for the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the new money yield of 3.6% increased slightly from 3.5% in 2016 largely due to a slight increase in interest rates.\nManagement evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its best estimate,\u201d or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.\n \u2022 The assumptions used in the determination of benefit reserves are prescribed under U.S. STAT, while the assumptions used under U.S. GAAP are generally the Company's best estimates. The methodologies for determining life insurance reserve amounts are also different. For example, reserving for living benefit reserves under U.S. STAT is generally addressed by the Commissioners' Annuity Reserving Valuation Methodology and the related Actuarial Guidelines, while under U.S. GAAP, those same living benefits are either embedded derivatives recorded at fair value or are recorded as additional minimum guarantee benefit reserves. The sensitivity of these life insurance reserves to changes in equity markets, as applicable, will be different between U.S. GAAP and U.S. STAT. \n\nThe Company manages credit risk on an on-going basis through the use of various processes and analyses. Both the investment and reinsurance areas have formulated procedures for counterparty approvals and authorizations, which establish minimum levels of creditworthiness and financial stability. Credits considered for investment are subjected to underwriting reviews. Within the investment portfolio, private securities are subject to committee review for approval. Mitigation strategies vary across the three sources of credit risk, but may include:\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2016, the loss related to the combined GMWB derivatives, net, which include the GMWB product, reinsurance, and hedging derivatives, was primarily driven by losses of $53 due to liability/model assumption updates, $22 due to the effect of increases in equity markets and losses of $12 resulting from regression updates and other changes, partially offset by gains of $40 resulting from policyholder behavior and $29 related to an outperformance of the underlying actively managed funds compared to their respective indices. The macro hedge program loss was primarily due to a loss of $96 due to an increase in equity markets and a loss of $58 driven by time decay on options.  Other, net\n [2] Excludes contracts that are fully reinsured. \nYear ended December 31, 2017\nEvaluation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities and Valuation Allowances on Mortgage Loans\nThe Company uses reinsurance for a portion of contracts with GMWB riders issued prior to the second quarter of 2006. The Company also uses reinsurance for a majority of the GMDB NAR.\nA decline in interest rates results in certain mortgage-backed and municipal securities being more susceptible to paydowns and prepayments or calls. During such periods, the Company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields. Lower interest rates will also likely result in lower net investment income, increased hedging costs associated with variable annuities and, if declines are sustained for a long period of time, it may subject the Company to reinvestment risk and possibly reduced profit margins associated with guaranteed crediting rates on certain products. Conversely, the fair value of the investment portfolio will increase when interest rates decline.\nLimited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments\n \u2022 Other, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to losses of $17 on interest rate derivatives and losses of $13 related to equity derivatives which were hedging against a decline in the equity market on the investment portfolio. \n [2] Includes future minimum lease payments on operating lease agreements. \nA multidisciplinary group of finance, actuarial and risk management professionals reviews and approves changes to the Company's valuation model as well as associated controls.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, impairments recognized in earnings were comprised of intent-to-sell impairments of $4 and credit impairments of $22, both of which were primarily concentrated in corporate securities. Also, impairments recognized in earnings included impairments on equity securities of $2 that were in an unrealized loss position and the Company no longer believed the securities would recover in the foreseeable future.\nEstimated gross profits ( EGPs\u201d) are used in the valuation and amortization of the DAC asset. Portions of EGPs are also used in the valuation of reserves for death and other insurance benefit features on variable annuity and other universal life-type contracts.\n(Dollar amounts in millions unless otherwise stated)\nFrom a governance perspective, senior members of our Enterprise Risk Management, Information Protection and Internal Audit functions provide detailed, regular reports on cybersecurity matters to The Hartford's Board, including the Finance, Investment, and Risk Management Committee (FIRMCo), which has principal responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity risk, and/or the Audit Committee,\nFinancial Risk on Statutory Capital\n \u2022 Non-renewing policies/contracts or reinsurance treaties.  The Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Aggregate counterparty credit quality and exposure is monitored on a daily basis utilizing an enterprise-wide credit exposure information system that contains data on issuers, ratings, exposures, and credit limits. Exposures are tracked on a current and potential basis and aggregated by ultimate parent across investments, reinsurance receivables, insurance products with credit risk, and derivative counterparties.\nThe Unlock charge, after-tax, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the reduction of the fixed annuity DAC balance to zero, updates to the macro hedging program cost to reflect 2016 activity, and the effect of assumption updates for variable annuities, including to mortality. These impacts were partially offset by separate account returns being above our aggregated estimated\nLiabilities\nVariable Annuity Market Risk Exposures\nThe Company expects to incur GMDB payments in the future only if the policyholder has an in the money\u201d GMDB at their death. For policies with a GMWB rider, the company expects to incur GMWB payments in the future only if the account value is reduced over time to a specified level through a combination of market performance and periodic withdrawals, at which point the contractholder will receive an annuity equal to the GRB which is generally equal to premiums less withdrawals. For the Company's lifetime\u201d GMWB products, this annuity can exceed the GRB. As the account value fluctuates with equity market returns on a daily basis and the lifetime\u201d GMWB payments may exceed the GRB, the ultimate amount to be paid by the Company, if any, is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than the Company's current carried liability. For additional information on the Company's GMWB liability, see Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on the Company's GMDB liability, see Note 7 - Reserves for Future Policy Benefits and Separate Account Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 Costs incurred by the Company to acquire insurance policies are deferred under U.S. GAAP while those costs are expensed immediately under U.S. STAT. \n\nMarket Unlocks\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nFinancial Risk Management\nLiquidity risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings or capital arising from the Company's inability or perceived inability to meet its contractual funding obligations when they come due.\nCapital Market Derivatives\nGMWB Hedge Program\nInvestment Portfolio Composition\n \u2022 estimated gross profits used in the valuation and amortization of assets and liabilities associated with variable annuity and other universal life-type contracts; \nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOperating cash flows in all periods have been adequate to meet liquidity requirements.\n\u2022Purchasing insurance coverage.\nOperational risk can result in financial loss, disruption of our business, regulatory actions or damage to our reputation.\nEuropean Exposure\n\nThe decrease in DAC amortization was primarily driven by the effect of a favorable unlock in 2017 compared to an unfavorable unlock in 2016. For further discussion of the unlock, see MD&A - Estimated Gross Profits.\nRisk-based Capital\nCredit Risk of Derivatives\nManaging the Credit Risk of Counterparties to Derivative Instruments\n \u2022 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and \nThe Company's issued non-investment type contracts include structured settlement contracts, terminal funding agreements, and on-benefit payout annuities (i.e., the annuitant is currently receiving benefits). The cash outflows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing. Similar to investment-type products, the aggregate cash flow payment streams are relatively predictable. Products in this category may rely upon actuarial pricing assumptions (including mortality and morbidity) and have an element of cash flow uncertainty. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $6,841 and $6,887, respectively of liabilities for structured settlements and terminal funding agreements and $1,627 and $1,636, respectively, of liabilities for on-benefit payout annuities.\nValuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments\nThe Company determines EGPs from a single deterministic reversion to mean ( RTM\u201d) separate account return projection which is an estimation technique commonly used by insurance entities to project future separate account returns. Through this estimation technique, the Company's DAC model is adjusted to reflect actual fund performance at the end of each quarter. Through consideration of recent market returns, the Company will unlock, or adjust, projected returns over a future period so that the account value returns to the long-term expected rate of return, providing that those projected returns do not exceed certain caps.\nThe following ratings actions were announced in connection with The Hartford's definitive agreement to sell Hartford Life Inc. and its life and annuity operating subsidiaries, Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company.\n\nFor further discussion on the impact of fair value changes from living benefits see Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and for a discussion on the sensitivities of certain living benefits due to capital market factors see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Variable Product Guarantee Risks and Risk Management.\nThe following table presents the Company's AFS securities by type, as well as fixed maturities and equity, FVO. \n\nFixed Liabilities and the Invested Assets Supporting Them\nEquity risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of global equities or equity indices. The Company has exposure to equity risk from assets under management and embedded derivatives within the Company's variable annuities. Equity Risk on the Company's Variable Annuity products is mitigated through various hedging programs. For further information, refer to Enterprise Risk Management, Managing Equity Risk on Variable Annuity Products.\n [4] Surrenders of, or policy loans taken from, as applicable, these general account liabilities, may be funded through operating cash flows of the Company, available short-term investments, or the Company may be required to sell fixed maturity investments to fund the surrender payment. These obligations include the general account option for individual variable annuities and the variable life contracts of the former Individual Life business, the general account option for annuities of the former Retirement Plans business and universal life contracts sold by the former Individual Life business. Sales of fixed maturity investments could result in the recognition of significant realized losses and insufficient proceeds to fully fund the surrender amount. In this circumstance, the Company may need to take other actions, including enforcing certain contract provisions which could restrict surrenders and/or slow or defer payouts. The Company has ceded reinsurance in connection with the sales of its Retirement Plans and Individual Life businesses to MassMutual and Prudential, respectively. The reinsurance transactions do not extinguish the Company's primary liability on the insurance policies issued under these businesses. \nComposition of Invested Assets\n \u2022 Requiring collateral; and \nINVESTMENT RESULTS\nThe Company has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company's exposure to credit risk. The Company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company's policies with respect to derivative counterparty exposure establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company's risk management team and reviewed by senior management.\nNon-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities and cash\nAggregate Recoverability\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred no losses on derivative instruments due to counterparty default.\nThe majority of the Company's credit risk is concentrated in its investment holdings but it is also present in the Company's reinsurance and insurance portfolios. A decline in creditworthiness is typically associated with an increase in an investment's credit spread, potentially resulting in an increase in other-than-temporary impairments and an increased probability of a realized loss upon sale. Premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables are also subject to credit risk based on the counterparty's unwillingness or inability to pay.\nIn connection with the pending sale of HLI and subsidiaries, the Company will forego approximately $460 of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryovers and foreign tax credits that will be retained by The Hartford. These deferred tax assets continue to be reflected as an asset in the accompanying financial statements as non-recoverability is contingent on the closing of the sale of the business.\nThe MD&A addresses the financial condition of Hartford Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries ( Hartford Life Insurance Company\u201d or the Company\u201d) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the comparable 2016 periods. Management's narrative analysis of the results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction I (2) (a) of Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes beginning on page. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation.\nThe objective of the Company's enterprise credit risk management strategy is to identify, quantify, and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis and to limit potential losses in accordance with an established credit risk management policy. The Company primarily manages its credit risk by holding a diversified mix of investment grade issuers and counterparties across its investment, reinsurance, and insurance portfolios. Potential losses are also limited within portfolios by diversifying across geographic regions, asset types, and sectors.\nThe Company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield. The Company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity, referenced index, or asset pool. The Company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that purchase credit protection was $80 and $131, respectively, while the fair value was $(3) and $(3), respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.\nOperating Summary\nThe fair values of the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $104 and $77, respectively. Included in these amounts are $5 and $5 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities that directly support liabilities denominated in the same currencies. The currency risk of the remaining non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities are hedged with foreign currency swaps. The Company holds $216 of yen-denominated cash, of which $214 is derivative cash collateral pledged by counterparties and has an offsetting collateral liability. In addition, the Company holds $306 of euro-denominated cash which is hedged with foreign currency forwards.\nUse of Estimated Gross Profits in Amortization and Reserving\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2017 primarily relates to net proceeds from available-for-sale securities of approximately $1.6 billion. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2016 primarily relates to net proceeds from available-for-sale securities of approximately $1.5 billion, partially offset by net payments for short-term investments of $769. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2015 primarily relates to net proceeds from short-term investments of approximately $1.6 billion.\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, or from external events. Operational risk is inherent in the Company's business and functional areas. Operational risks include legal; cyber and information security; models; third party vendors; technology; operations; business continuity; disaster recovery; internal and external fraud; and compliance.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to decreases in claims and benefits paid as well as a decrease in operating expenses, largely offset by a decrease in fee income and federal income tax refunds.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans \nCredit Risk\nThe Company hedged the foreign currency risk associated with these liability contracts with currency rate swaps. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the derivatives used to hedge foreign currency exchange risk related to foreign denominated liability contracts had a total notional amount of $94 and $94, and a total fair value of $(11) and $(25), respectively.\nManaging Equity Risk on Variable Annuity Products\n\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nThe Company's investment in the financial services sector is predominantly through investment grade banking and insurance institutions. The following table presents the Company's fixed maturities and equity, AFS securities in the financial services sector that are included in the preceding Securities by Type table.\nThe fair value of fixed income investments, which include fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, and short-term investments, was $26.8 billion and $28.1 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The weighted average duration of the portfolio, including derivative instruments, was approximately 7.6 years and 6.8 years as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNon-credit impairments recognized in other comprehensive income were $2 for the year ended December 31, 2017. These non-credit impairments represent the excess of the Company's best estimate of the discounted future cash flows over the fair value.\n [1] These sensitivities are based on the following key market levels as of December 31, 2017: 1) S&P of 2,674; 2) 10yr US swap rate of 2.42%; and 3) S&P 10yr volatility of 23.80%. \nThe Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better. The Company also generally requires that OTC derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\"ISDA\") Master Agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. The Company enters into credit support annexes in conjunction with the ISDA agreements, which require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds.\nFixed Income Investments\nThe Hartford has an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ( HFSG Holding Company\u201d) and certain affiliates of up to $2.0 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Connecticut Insurance Department (\"CTDOI\") granted approval for certain affiliated insurance companies that are parties to the agreement to treat receivables from a parent, including the HFSG Holding Company, as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding from the HFSG Holding Company.\nThe Hartford's Board of Directors ( the Board\u201d) has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, as described more fully in The Hartford's Proxy Statement, while management is tasked with the day-to-day management of The Hartford's risks.\nDerivative Commitments\nSources of Liquidity Risk include funding risk, company-specific liquidity risk and market liquidity risk resulting from differences in the amount and timing of sources and uses of cash as well as company-specific and general market conditions. Stressed market conditions may impact the ability to sell assets or otherwise transact business and may result in a significant loss in value.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed a comprehensive policyholder behavior assumption study which resulted in a non-market related after-tax charge of $35 and incorporated the results of that study into its projection of future gross profits. Additionally, throughout the year, the Company evaluates various aspects of policyholder behavior and will revise its policyholder assumptions if credible emerging data indicates that changes are warranted. The Company will continue to evaluate its assumptions related to policyholder behavior as initiatives to reduce the size of the annuity business are implemented by management. Upon completion of an annual assumption study or evaluation of credible new information, the Company will revise its assumptions to reflect its current best estimate. These assumption revisions will change the projected account values and the related EGPs in the DAC amortization models, as well as the death and other insurance benefit reserving model.\nThe Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day's market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives exceed the contractual thresholds. In accordance with industry standard and the contractual agreements, collateral is typically settled on same business day. The Company has exposure to credit risk\nThe fair value of AFS securities decreased, as compared with December 31, 2016, due to the continued run-off of the Company's business. Fixed maturities, FVO, are not included in the preceding table. For further discussion on FVO securities, see Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments related to the businesses included in the table above was $8.8 billion and $9.8 billion, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. The Company's sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.\nThe Company's stockholder's equity, as prepared using U.S. GAAP, was $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. The Company's estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus, as prepared in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual ( U.S. STAT\u201d), was $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInsurance Operations\nLegal Proceedings\n\nreturns during the period, largely due to an increase in equity markets, as well as the effect of reducing the assumption about expected future lapses of variable annuities.\nAs part of the Company's ongoing security monitoring process, the Company has reviewed its AFS securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that these securities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the securities approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. For these securities in an unrealized loss position where a credit impairment has not been recorded, the Company's best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities. For further information regarding the Company's impairment analysis, see Other-Than-Temporary Impairments in the Investment Portfolio Risks and Risk Management section of this MD&A.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities - Unrealized Loss Aging\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had no valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies. From time to time, tax planning strategies could include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery, making investments which have specific tax characteristics, and business considerations such as asset-liability matching. Management views such tax planning strategies as prudent and feasible and would implement them, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAnnual Unlock of Assumptions\nAn increase in interest rates from current levels is generally a favorable development for the Company. Interest rate increases are expected to provide additional net investment income, reduce the cost of the variable annuity hedging program, and limit the potential risk of margin erosion due to minimum guaranteed crediting rates in certain products. However, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time period, certain businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk refers to the risk that policyholders will surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment requiring the Company to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. An increase in interest rates may also impact the Company's tax planning strategies and in particular its ability to utilize tax benefits of previously recognized realized capital losses.\n\n\nThe agencies consider many factors in determining the final rating of an insurance company. One consideration is the relative level of statutory capital and surplus, (referred to collectively as \"statutory capital\") necessary to support the business written and is reported in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the applicable state insurance department.\nINDEX\nThe open foreign currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using currency futures/forwards/swaps. In order to manage the currency risk related to any non-U.S. dollar denominated liability contracts, the Company enters into foreign currency swaps or holds non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.\n [1] Primarily relates to derivative instruments.  Total investments decreased since December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of a decline in fixed maturities, AFS, and short-term investments. The decrease in fixed maturities, AFS was primarily the result of the continued runoff of the Company's business. The decrease in short-term investments was primarily due to a dividend payout and the reinvestment of short-term investments held as of December 31, 2016 into other asset classes.\n\nThrough December 31, 2017, commercial real estate market conditions, including property prices, occupancies, financial conditions, transaction volume, and delinquencies, remained mostly favorable and delinquencies remained very low. In addition, the availability of credit has has been adequate to refinance loans that have come due.\nThe components of the gross and net reinsurance recoverables are summarized as follows: \n\n [1] Primarily consists of changes in value of non-qualifying derivatives including credit derivatives and interest rate derivatives used to manage duration.  Gross Gains and Losses on Sales\nNon-U.S. dollar denominated funding agreement liability contracts\n[1] Pre-Refunded bonds are bonds for which an irrevocable trust containing sufficient U.S. treasury, agency, or other securities has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest.\nRisk Hedging\nAll assumption changes that affect the estimate of future EGPs including: the update of current account values; the use of the RTM estimation technique; and policyholder behavior assumptions are considered an Unlock in the period of revision. An Unlock adjusts DAC and death and other insurance benefit reserve balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with an offsetting benefit or charge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of the revision. An Unlock that results in an after-tax benefit generally occurs as a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being favorable compared to previous estimates. An Unlock that results in an after-tax charge generally occurs as a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being unfavorable compared to previous estimates.\nCertain of the Company's derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity's financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity's ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2017, was $692. Of this $692 the legal entities have posted collateral of $847, which is inclusive of initial margin requirements, in the normal course of business. In addition, the Company has posted collateral of $31 associated with a customized GMWB derivative. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2017, a downgrade of one or two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody's or S&P would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. These collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the collateral that we would post, if required, would be primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and government agency securities.\n \u2022 The impact of elapsed time on liabilities or hedge assets, any non-parallel shifts in capital market factors, or correlated moves across the sensitivities.  In December 2017, the Company added hedge positions in the macro hedge program to reduce open equity risk exposure, which increased the sensitivity that changes in equity market returns would have on GAAP net income.\nBenefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased due to lower death benefits and interest credited primarily due to the continued run-off of the variable annuity block of business.\nThe Company also enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company's investment policies. These swaps reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include customized diversified portfolios of corporate issuers, which are established within sector concentration limits and may be divided into tranches which possess different credit ratings. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that assume credit risk was $380 and $458, respectively, while the fair value was $3 and $4, respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.\nFor a discussion regarding Guaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n [1] Yields calculated using annualized net investment income divided by the monthly average invested assets at cost, amortized cost, or adjusted carrying value, as applicable, excluding repurchase agreement and securities lending collateral, if any, and derivatives book value. \nThe calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in net economic value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nThe Hartford, like many other large financial services companies, blocks attempted cyber intrusions on a daily basis. In the event of a cyber intrusion, the company invokes its Cyber Incident Response Program commensurate with the nature of the intrusion. While the actual methods employed differ based on the event, our approach employs internal teams and outside advisors with specialized skills to support the response and recovery efforts and requires elevation of issues, as necessary, to senior management.\nDividends to the Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer's policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer's earned surplus or certain other thresholds as calculated under applicable state insurance law, the dividend requires the prior approval of the domestic regulator. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiary, regulatory capital requirements and liquidity requirements of the individual operating company.\nThe Company's variable annuity hedging program is primarily focused, through the use of reinsurance and capital market derivative instruments, on reducing the economic exposure to market risks associated with guaranteed benefits that are embedded in our variable annuity contracts. The variable annuity hedging program also considers the potential impacts on statutory capital.\nThe effective tax rate differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% in 2017 and 2016, primarily due to a charge of $396 as a result of Tax Reform enacted in December, 2017. Among other changes, Tax Reform reduced the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 which resulted in a reduction of the Company's net deferred tax assets, including its net operating loss carryovers. For a reconciliation of the income tax provision at the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes, see Note 9 - Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nRatings\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, impairments recognized in earnings were comprised of credit impairments of $14. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there were no securities that the Company intends to sell (\"intent-to-sell impairments\") or impairments on equity securities.\n \u2022 risk identification and assessment; \nTotal net investment income decreased primarily due to lower asset levels as well as lower income received from previously impaired securities. For further discussion, see MD&A - Investments Results, Net Investment Income.\n [1] Each of these guarantees and the related U.S. GAAP accounting volatility will also be influenced by actual and estimated policyholder behavior. \nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's European investment exposure had an amortized cost and fair value of $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, or 6% of total invested assets; as of December 31, 2016, amortized cost and fair value totaled $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The investment exposure largely relates to corporate entities which are domiciled in or generate a significant portion of their revenue within the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the weighted average credit quality of European investments was BBB+ and A-, respectively. Entities domiciled in the United Kingdom comprise the Company's largest exposure; as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the U.K. exposure totals less than 3% of total invested assets and largely relates to industrial and financial services securities and has an average credit rating of BBB+. The majority of the European investments are U.S. dollar-denominated, and those securities that are British pound or euro-denominated are hedged to U.S. dollars. For a discussion of foreign currency risks, see the Foreign Currency Exchange Risk section of this MD&A.\nDividends\nOn October 23, 2017, Moody's lowered its counterparty credit and insurer financial strength ratings on Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company to Baa3. Given this downgrade action, termination rating triggers in two derivative counterparty relationships in which the Company has open derivative contracts were impacted. The Company has successfully re-negotiated the rating triggers with these counterparties. Accordingly, the Company does not expect the current hedging programs to be adversely impacted by the announcement of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company. In addition, as a result of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, the Company is required to post an additional $9 of collateral related to a single counterparty relationship.\nThe Company has exposure to commercial mortgage loans as presented in the following table. These loans are collateralized by a variety of commercial properties and are diversified both geographically throughout the United States and by property type. These loans are primarily in the form of whole loans, where the Company is the sole lender, but may include participations. Loan participations are loans where the Company has purchased or retained a portion of an outstanding loan or package of loans and participates on a pro-rata basis in collecting interest and principal pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement. As of December 31, 2017, loans within the Company's mortgage loan portfolio that have had extensions or restructurings other than what is allowable under the original terms of the contract are immaterial.\nfor amounts below the exposure thresholds which are uncollateralized, as well as for market fluctuations that may occur between contractual settlement periods of collateral movements.\nTotal gross unrealized losses were $73 as of December 31, 2017, and have improved $133, or 65%, from December 31, 2016, due to tighter credit spreads. As of December 31, 2017, $71 of the gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The remaining $2 of gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed greater than 20%. The securities depressed more than 20% are primarily securities with exposure to commercial real estate and corporate securities in the energy sector that decreased in value primarily due to wider credit spreads since the securities were purchased.\nReinsurance\nYear ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table presents our estimates of the potential instantaneous impacts from sudden market stresses related to equity market prices, interest rates, and implied market volatilities. The following sensitivities represent: (1) the net estimated difference between the change in the fair value of GMWB liabilities and the underlying hedge instruments and (2) the estimated change in fair value of the hedge instruments for the macro program, before the impacts of amortization of DAC and taxes. As noted in the preceding discussion, certain hedge assets are used to hedge liabilities that are not carried at fair value and will not have a liability offset in the U.S. GAAP sensitivity analysis. All sensitivities are measured as of December 31, 2017 and are related to the fair value of liabilities and hedge instruments in place at that date for the Company's variable annuity hedge programs. The impacts presented in the table that follows are estimated individually and measured without consideration of any correlation among market risk factors.\nThe Company's issued investment contracts and certain insurance product liabilities, other than non-guaranteed separate accounts, include asset accumulation vehicles such as fixed annuities, guaranteed investment products, and other investment and universal life-type contracts. The primary risk associated with these products is that, despite the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns.\n\n [1] No allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was required as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company has reinsurance recoverables from MassMutual and Prudential of $8.3 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has reinsurance recoverables from MassMutual and Prudential of $8.6 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. The Company's obligations to its direct policyholders that have been reinsured to MassMutual and Prudential are secured by invested assets held in trust. As of December 31, 2017, net of invested assets held in trust, the Company has no reinsurance-related concentrations of credit risk greater than 10% of the Company's Consolidated Stockholder's Equity.\nENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n\n [4] Includes consumer notes of $8. Consumer notes include principal payments, contractual interest for fixed rate notes, and interest based on current rates for floating rate notes. \n \u2022 Selling investments subject to credit risk; \nThe Company has entered into pay U.S. dollar, receive yen swap contracts to hedge the currency exposure between the U.S. dollar denominated assets and the yen denominated fixed liability reinsurance payments.\n [1] Includes securities with pools of loans issued by the Small Business Administration which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  The decline in the fair value of AFS securities as compared to December 31, 2016 was due to the continued run-off of the Company's business, partially offset by an increase in valuations due to tighter credit spreads.\nIn addition to updating assumptions in the fourth quarter of each year, an Unlock revises EGPs, on a quarterly basis, to reflect the Company's current best estimate assumptions and market updates of policyholder account value. The Unlock for future separate account returns is determined each quarter. Under RTM, the expected long term rate of return is 8.3%. The annual return assumed over the next five years of approximately (0.4)% was calculated based on the return needed over that period to produce an 8.3% return since March of 2009, the date the Company adopted the RTM estimation technique to project future separate account returns. Based on the expected trend of policy lapses and annuitizations, the Company expects approximately 55% of its block of variable annuities to runoff in the next 5 years.\n \u2022 Entering into contracts only with strong creditworthy institutions \n Net Investment Income \nAs of December 31, 2017, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of derivative relationships that could be subject to immediate termination in the event of a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings was $1.5 billion and $12, respectively. These amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated.\nContingencies Relating to Corporate Litigation and Regulatory Matters\n \u2022 Hedging through use of single name or basket credit default swaps; \n \u2022 Temporary differences between the book and tax basis of an asset or liability which are recorded as deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability under U.S. GAAP while those amounts deferred are subject to limitations under U.S. STAT. \nEquity Risk\n\u2022Validating existing crisis management protocols;\nThe Company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. Legal personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a reasonable possibility of loss. These matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the appropriate disclosure. The outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the Company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are subject to significant changes. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the Company. In view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the Company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations and liquidity in a particular quarterly or annual period.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n[2] Leasing revenue bonds are generally the obligations of a financing authority established by the municipality that leases facilities back to a municipality. The notes are typically secured by lease payments made by the municipality that is leasing the facilities financed by the issue. Lease payments may be subject to annual appropriation by the municipality or the municipality may be obligated to appropriate general tax revenues to make lease payments.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Company has exposure to interest rates arising from its fixed maturity securities and interest sensitive liabilities. In addition, certain product liabilities, including those containing GMWB or GMDB, expose the Company to interest rate risk but also have significant equity risk. These liabilities are discussed as part of the Variable Product Guarantee Risks and Risk Management section. Management also evaluates performance of certain products based on net investment spread which is, in part, influenced by changes in interest rates.\nForeign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies. The Company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, which primarily consist of fixed maturity and equity investments, foreign denominated cash and a yen denominated fixed payout annuity.\n [3] Included in purchase obligations is $40 relating to contractual commitments to purchase various goods and services such as maintenance and information technology in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty, or contracts that do not specify minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased. \n \u2022 living benefits required to be fair valued (in other policyholder funds and benefits payable); \nDeferred tax assets represent the tax benefit of future deductible temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized if there is no change in tax law. Under U.S. GAAP, we test the value of deferred tax assets for impairment on a quarterly basis at the entity level within each tax jurisdiction, consistent with our filed tax returns. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we have considered all available evidence as of December 31, 2017 including past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions.\nThe following table presents the Company's impairments recognized in earnings by security type.\nThe underlying guaranteed withdrawal benefit liabilities (excluding the life contingent portion of GMWB contracts) and hedge assets within the GMWB hedge and Macro hedge programs are carried at fair value.\nFixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments and Free-standing Derivatives\nThe following table presents the Company's unrealized loss aging for AFS securities continuously depressed over 20% by length of time (also included in the table above).\nCapital resources and liquidity represent the overall strength of Hartford Life Insurance Company and its ability to generate strong cash flows, borrow funds at competitive rates and to meet operating needs over the next twelve months.\n \u2022 Decreases in the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, may reduce statutory surplus and RBC ratios. \nThe Company cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers to enable the Company to manage capital and risk exposure. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company.\nIncluded in the following table is the before-tax change in the net economic value of investment contracts including structured settlements, fixed annuity contracts and terminal funding agreements for which the payment rates are fixed at contract issuance and/or the investment experience is substantially absorbed by the Company's operations, along with the corresponding invested assets. Also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by the Company to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the investment portfolios supporting these contracts. This analysis does not include the assets and corresponding liabilities of certain insurance products such as certain life contingent annuities. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments. Insulated separate account assets and liabilities are excluded from the analysis because gains and losses in separate accounts accrue to policyholders.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017: \nLiving Benefits Required to be Fair Valued\nThe Unlock charge in the table above includes both assumption unlocks and market unlocks.\n [3] Primarily includes income from derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting and hedge fixed maturities.  Year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose risk-based capital ( RBC\u201d) requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, based on its size and risk profile. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's total adjusted capital ( TAC\u201d) to its authorized control level RBC ( ACL RBC\u201d). Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The minimum level of TAC before corrective action commences ( Company Action Level\u201d) is two times the ACL RBC. The adequacy of a company's capital is determined by the ratio of a company's TAC to its Company Action Level, known as the \"RBC ratio\". The Company and all of its operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations. The RBC ratios for the Company and its principal life insurance operating subsidiaries were all in excess of 300% of their Company Action Levels as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The reporting of RBC ratios is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company, or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities.\nThe Company uses reinsurance for a portion of contracts with GMWB riders issued prior to the second quarter of 2006. The Company also uses reinsurance for a majority of the GMDB NAR.\n [1] The vintage year represents the year the pool of loans was originated. \n \u2022 the development of risk appetites, tolerances, and limits; \nAt the end of 2017, Congress passed and the president signed, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\"), which enacted significant reforms to the U.S. tax code. The major areas of interest to the Company include the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and the refunding of AMT credits. We continue to analyze Tax Reform for other potential impacts. The U.S. Treasury and IRS will develop guidance implementing Tax Reform, and Congress may consider additional technical corrections to the legislation. Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by Congress and/or the U.S. Treasury Department could have a material effect on the Company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear. For additional information on risks to the Company related to Tax Reform, please see the risk factor entitled \"Changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity\" under \"Risk Factors\" in Part I.", "item_7_text": "\nFor further information on other contingencies, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments related to the businesses included in the table above was $18.0 billion and $18.3 billion, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The assets supporting the fixed liabilities are monitored and managed within set duration guidelines, and are evaluated on a daily basis, as well as annually using scenario simulation techniques in compliance with regulatory requirements.\nUnder the dynamic hedging program, the Company enters into derivative contracts to hedge market risk exposures associated with the GMWB liabilities that are not reinsured. These derivative contracts include customized swaps, interest rate swaps and futures, and equity swaps, options, and futures, on certain indices including the S&P 500 index, EAFE index, and NASDAQ index.\n \u2022 The difference between the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity and other investments, net of tax, is recorded as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the related asset and to equity under U.S. GAAP, while U.S. STAT only records certain securities at fair value, such as equity securities and certain lower rated bonds required by the NAIC to be recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. \n [1] Amortized cost represents carrying value prior to valuation allowances, if any.  During 2017, the Company funded $389 of commercial whole loans with a weighted average loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) ratio of 70% and a weighted average yield of 3.9%. The Company continues to originate commercial whole loans within primary markets, such as office, industrial and multi-family, focusing on loans with strong LTV ratios and high quality property collateral. There were no mortgage loans held for sale as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.\nThe preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ, and in the past have differed, from those estimates.\nInterest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk encompasses exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. Interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads.\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources of the Company, except for unfunded commitments to purchase investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, private placements, and mortgage loans of $787 as disclosed in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn 2017, HLIC paid dividends of $1.4 billion of which $800 was a return of capital used by The Hartford to help fund Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company's (\"HLA\") acquisition of the Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business. $550 of the $800 return of capital was funded through an extraordinary dividend from HLAI to the Company and approved by the CTDOI.\nOn October 23, 2017, Moody's lowered its counterparty credit and insurer financial strength ratings on Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company to Baa3. Given this downgrade action, termination rating triggers in two derivative counterparty relationships in which the Company has open derivative contracts were impacted. The Company has successfully re-negotiated the rating triggers with these counterparties. Accordingly, the Company does not expect the current hedging programs to be adversely impacted by the announcement of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company. In addition, as a result of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, the Company is required to post an additional $9 of collateral related to a single counterparty relationship.\nStatutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease in any period depending upon a variety of factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. In general, as equity market levels and interest rates decline, the amount and volatility of both our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin can be materially negatively affected, sometimes at a greater than linear rate. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. Factors include:\n \u2022 Rising equity markets will generally result in an increase in statutory surplus and RBC ratios. However, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and RBC requirements could increase with rising equity markets, resulting in lower RBC ratios. The Company has reinsured approximately 43% of its risk associated with GMWB and 81% of its risk associated with the aggregate GMDB exposure. These reinsurance agreements reduce the Company's exposure to changes in the statutory reserves and the related capital and RBC ratios associated with changes in the capital markets. \n \u2022 A decrease in the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, due in part to credit spreads widening, may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and RBC ratios. \nThe following table presents the Company's exposure to CMBS bonds by current credit quality and vintage year included in the preceding Securities by Type table. Credit protection represents the current weighted average percentage of the outstanding capital structure subordinated to the Company's investment holding that is available to absorb losses before the security incurs the first dollar loss of principal and excludes any equity interest or property value in excess of outstanding debt.\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2017, losses on the variable annuity hedge program included losses related to the macro hedge program primarily due to losses of $180 driven by improvements in the equity markets and $85 driven by time decay of options. These losses were partially offset by net gains on the combined GMWB derivatives, net, which include the GMWB product, reinsurance, and hedging derivatives, primarily due to gains of $25 driven by time decay of options, $20 due to a decline in the equity market volatility and $20 due to policyholder behavior. \nFuture impairments may develop as the result of changes in intent-to-sell specific securities or if actual results underperform current modeling assumptions, which may be the result of, but are not limited to, macroeconomic factors and security-specific performance below current expectations.\nCommercial Real Estate\n\u2022Establishing policies and monitoring risk tolerances and exceptions;\nThe following table presents the Company's fixed maturities, AFS, by credit quality. The credit ratings referenced throughout this section are based on availability, and are generally the midpoint of the available ratings among Moody's, S&P, Fitch and Morningstar. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\nThe decrease in net income was primarily due to a charge to income tax expense of $396 arising from the reduction of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of lower Federal income tax rates, partially offset by a decline in net realized capital losses. The effect of lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, lower benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses, and lower insurance operating costs and other expenses, was offset by lower earned premiums and lower fee income and other.\nEstimated Gross Profits\n \u2022 contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.  Certain of these estimates are particularly sensitive to market conditions, and deterioration and/or volatility in the worldwide debt or equity markets could have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In developing these estimates management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements.\nCredit risk is the risk to earnings or capital due to uncertainty of an obligor's or counterparty's ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with contractually agreed upon terms. Credit risk is comprised of three major factors: the risk of change in credit quality, or credit migration risk; the risk of default; and the risk of a change in value due to changes in credit spread.\n [3] For all contracts that are in the money\u201d, this represents the percentage by which the average contract was in the money. \nThe Company also utilizes a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its investment portfolio or to hedge liabilities. Interest rate caps, floors, swaps, swaptions, and futures may be used to manage portfolio duration. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. The use of such swaps enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to desired objectives and manage the duration profile within established tolerances. Interest rate swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flow of a forecasted purchase or sale of fixed rate securities due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk, including offsetting positions, totaled $4.7 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, related to investments and $34 and $100, respectively, related to liabilities. The fair value of these derivatives was $(356) and $(404) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts do not include derivatives associated with the Variable Annuity Hedging Program.\nFinancial Services\nValuation Allowances on Mortgage Loans\n\nThe Company has defined ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to assess liquidity across the enterprise under both current and stressed market conditions. The Company measures and manages liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within prescribed limits across legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory and operational limitations to the transferability of liquidity. The Company also monitors internal and external conditions, and identifies material risk changes and emerging risks that may impact liquidity. The Company's CFO has primary responsibility for liquidity risk.\n [2] Relates to contracts such as payout annuities, institutional notes, term life, group benefit contracts, or death and living benefit reserves, which cannot be surrendered for cash. \nExposure to CMBS Bonds\n [1] Estimated life and annuity obligations include death claims, other charges associated with policyholder reserves, policy surrenders and policyholder dividends, offset by expected future deposits on in-force contracts. Estimated life and annuity obligations are based on mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with the Company's historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. The Company has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with other assumptions. In contrast to this table, the majority of the Company's obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth, interest crediting, or future deposits. Therefore, the estimated obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits, other policyholder funds and benefits payable, and separate account liabilities. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results. \nWhile interest rates have risen recently, we expect the annualized net investment income yield in 2018, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, to be slightly below the portfolio yield earned in 2017. This assumes the Company earns less income in 2018 from make-whole payments on fixed maturities and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans than it did in 2017 and that reinvestment rates continue to be below the average yield of sales and maturities. The estimated impact on net investment income is subject to change as the composition of the portfolio changes through portfolio management and trading activities and changes in market conditions.\n \n \u2022 U.S. STAT for life insurance companies establishes a formula reserve for realized and unrealized losses due to default and equity risks associated with certain invested assets (the Asset Valuation Reserve), while U.S. GAAP does not. Also, for those realized gains and losses caused by changes in interest rates, U.S. STAT for life insurance companies defers and amortizes the gains and losses, caused by changes in interest rates, into income over the original life to maturity of the asset sold (the Interest Maintenance Reserve) while U.S. GAAP does not.  In addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under U.S. STAT. U.S. GAAP generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.\nThe Company's macro hedging program uses derivative instruments, such as options and futures on equities and interest rates, to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from GMWB and GMDB liabilities on the Company's statutory surplus. These macro hedges cover some of the residual risks not otherwise covered by the dynamic hedging program. Management assesses this residual risk under various scenarios in designing and executing the macro hedge program. The macro hedge program will result in additional U.S. GAAP earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory reserve and capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in U.S. GAAP liabilities.\nFair values for GMWBs classified as embedded derivatives and included in other policyholder funds and benefits payable, are calculated using the income approach based upon internally developed models, because active, observable markets do not exist for those items. The fair value of these GMWBs and the related reinsurance and customized freestanding derivatives are calculated as an aggregation of the following components: Best Estimate Claim Payments; Credit Standing Adjustment; and Margins. The resulting aggregation is reconciled or calibrated, if necessary, to market information that is, or may be, available to the Company, but may not be observable by other market participants, including reinsurance discussions and transactions. The Company believes the aggregation of these components, as calibrated to the market information, results in an amount that the Company would be required to transfer to or receive from market participants in an active liquid market, if one existed, for those market participants to assume the risks associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits and the related reinsurance and customized derivatives. The fair value is likely to materially diverge from the ultimate settlement of the liability as the Company believes settlement will be based on our best estimate assumptions rather than those best estimate assumptions plus risk margins. In the absence of any transfer of the guaranteed benefit liability to a third party, the release of risk margins is likely to be reflected as realized gains in future periods' net income.\nThe following table presents the Company's exposure to municipal bonds by type and weighted average credit quality included in the preceding Securities by Type tables.\nThese ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of the Company's securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization.\nOn December 4, 2017, Moody's Investors Service placed its ratings for Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, both rated Baa3 for insurance financial strength, under review for further downgrade, and downgraded the senior debt rating of Hartford Life, Inc. to Ba3 from Baa2 with a continuing review for downgrade.\nNet realized capital losses decreased primarily due to the effect of transactional foreign currency revaluation, higher net gains on sales and lower impairments, partially offset by greater losses on non-qualifying foreign currency derivatives and the variable annuity hedge program. For further information, see MD&A - Investment Results, Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).\nThe European economy performed better than expected in 2017, propelled by resilient private consumption, stronger growth around the world and lower unemployment. While some economic conditions have improved, sluggish wage growth points towards continued accommodative monetary policy throughout Europe in 2018. The Company manages the credit risk associated with the European securities within the investment portfolio on an on-going basis using several processes which are supported by macroeconomic analysis and issuer credit analysis. For additional details regarding the Company's management of credit risk, see the Credit Risk section of this MD&A.\nFor the company's derivative programs, the maximum uncollateralized threshold for a derivative counterparty for a single legal entity is $10. The Company currently transacts OTC derivatives in two legal entities that have a threshold greater than zero. The maximum combined threshold for a single counterparty across all legal entities that use derivatives is $10. In addition, the Company may have exposure to multiple counterparties in a single corporate family due to a common credit support provider; however, the thresholds for these relationships are zero. Based on the contractual terms of the collateral agreements, these thresholds may be immediately reduced due to a downgrade in either party's credit rating. For further discussion, see the Derivative Commitments section of Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n [1] Includes equity, AFS securities with an amortized cost and fair value of $40 and $48, respectively as of December 31, 2017 and an amortized cost and fair value of $69 and $69, respectively, as of December 31, 2016 included in the AFS by type table above.  The Company's investment in the financial services sector decreased, as compared to December 31, 2016, primarily due to sales of corporate securities.\nThe preceding sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be used to predict the future financial performance of the Company's variable annuity hedge programs. The actual net changes in the fair value liability and the hedging assets illustrated in the preceding table may vary materially depending on a variety of factors which include but are not limited to:\nFor further information on credit derivatives, see Note 4- Derivative Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments\nValuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets\nSignificant differences between U.S. GAAP stockholder's equity and aggregate statutory capital prepared in accordance with U.S. STAT include the following:\nThe Company manages and monitors risk through risk policies, controls and limits. At the senior management level, an Enterprise Risk and Capital Committee ( ERCC\u201d) includes The Hartford's CEO, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Risk Officer, General Counsel and others as deemed necessary by the committee chair. The ERCC oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the Company. A number of functional committees sit underneath the ERCC, providing oversight of specific risk areas and recommending risk mitigation strategies to the ERCC. These committees include, but are not limited to, Asset Liability Committees, Catastrophe Risk Committee, Economic Capital Executive Committee, Emerging Risk Committees, Model Oversight Committees and the Operational Risk Committee. The Hartford's enterprise risk management (\"ERM\") function supports the ERCC and functional committees, and is tasked with, among other things:\nInterest Rate Risk\n \u2022 Sustained low interest rates with respect to the fixed annuity business may result in a reduction in statutory surplus and an increase in NAIC required capital. \n Net Realized Capital Losses \nThe following table summarizes Hartford Life Insurance Company's significant member companies' financial ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of February 27, 2018:\nEGPs are also used to determine the expected excess benefits and assessments included in the measurement of death and other insurance benefit reserves. These excess benefits and assessments are derived from a range of stochastic scenarios that have been calibrated to the Company's RTM separate account returns. The determination of death and other insurance benefit reserves is also impacted by discount rates, lapses, volatilities, mortality assumptions and benefit utilization, including assumptions around annuitization rates.\nRatings can have an impact on the Company's reinsurance and derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company's ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company's ratings are downgraded, reinsurance contracts may be adversely impacted and the Company may be required to post additional collateral on certain derivative contracts.\nMost of the Company's variable annuities include GMDB and certain contracts with GMDB also include GMWB features. Declines in the equity markets will increase the Company's liability for these benefits. Many contracts with a GMDB include a maximum anniversary value (\"MAV\"), which in rising markets resets the guarantee on the anniversary to be 'at the money'. As the MAV increases, it can increase the NAR for subsequent declines in account value. Generally, a GMWB contract is \u2018in the money' if the contractholder's guaranteed remaining balance (\"GRB\") becomes greater than the account value.\nThe following table provides an analysis showing the estimated before-tax change in the fair value of the Company's investments and related derivatives, excluding assets supporting fixed liabilities which are included in the table above, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments.\nStatutory Capital\nCybersecurity Risk\n \u2022 valuation of investments and derivative instruments including evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities and valuation allowances on mortgage loans; \nThe following table presents the Company's investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments which include hedge funds, real estate funds, and private equity funds. Since December 31, 2015, the Company has reduced the allocation to hedge funds. Real estate funds consist of investments primarily in real estate equity funds and joint ventures, including some funds with public market exposure. Private equity funds primarily consist of investments in funds whose assets typically consist of a diversified pool of investments in small to mid-sized non-public businesses with high growth potential as well as limited exposure to public markets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, credit impairments were primarily related to two corporate securities and were identified through security specific reviews and resulted from changes in the financial condition of the issuers. The Company incorporates its best estimate of future performance using internal assumptions and judgments that are informed by economic and industry specific trends, as well as our expectations with respect to security specific developments.\nThe Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a \"waterfall\" approach comprised of the following pricing sources which are listed in priority order: quoted prices, prices from third-party pricing services, internal matrix pricing, and independent broker quotes. The fair value of free-standing derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded transactions and transactions cleared through central clearing houses (\"OTC-cleared\") may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. For further discussion, see the Fixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments and Free-standing Derivatives section in Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For further discussion on the GMWB customized derivative valuation methodology, see the GMWB Embedded, Customized and Reinsurance Derivatives section in fair value measurement, see Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash Flows \nLiquidity Requirements and Sources of Capital\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\nVariable Annuity Hedging Program Sensitivities\n [1] In the event customers elect to surrender separate account assets, the Company will use the proceeds from the sale of the assets to fund the surrender, and the Company's liquidity position will not be impacted. In many instances the Company will receive a percentage of the surrender amount as compensation for early surrender (surrender charge), increasing the Company's liquidity position. In addition, a surrender of variable annuity separate account or general account assets (see the following) will decrease the Company's obligation for payments on guaranteed living and death benefits. \n \u2022 The sensitivity analysis is only valid as of the measurement date and assumes instantaneous changes in the capital market factors and no ability to rebalance hedge positions prior to the market changes; \nResponsibility for day-to-day management of operational risk lies within each business unit and functional area. ERM provides an enterprise-wide view of the Company's operational risk on an aggregate basis. ERM is responsible for establishing, maintaining and communicating the framework, principles and guidelines of the Company's operational risk management program. Operational risk mitigation strategies include the following:\n [1] Contracts with a guaranteed living benefit also have a guaranteed death benefit. The NAR for each benefit is shown; however these benefits are not additive. When a contract terminates due to death, any NAR related to GMWB is released. Similarly, when a contract goes into benefit status on a GMWB, the GMDB NAR is reduced to zero. \nOperational Risk\nFor a discussion of accounting standards, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 Non-market factors, which can also impact the amount and volatility of both our actual potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin, include actual and estimated policyholder behavior experience as it pertains to lapsation, partial withdrawals, and mortality.  Most of these factors are outside of the Company's control. The Company's financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by its statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer, or counterparty greater than 10% of the Company's stockholder's equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government securities. For further discussion of concentration of credit risk in the investment portfolio, see the Concentration of Credit Risk section in Note 3 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 Credit spreads on invested assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. As actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in the current crediting rates, the calculation of statutory reserves for fixed MVA annuities will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. \nThe NAR is generally defined as the guaranteed minimum benefit amount in excess of the contractholder's current account value. Variable annuity account values with guarantee features were $40.8 billion and $40.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n \u2022 risk monitoring; and \nContingencies\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nCapital resources available to fund liquidity upon contractholder surrender or termination are a function of the legal entity in which the liquidity requirement resides. Obligations related to life and annuity insurance products will be generally funded by both HLIC and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company (\"HLAI\"); obligations related to retirement and institutional investment products will be generally funded by HLIC.\nThe Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction. Downgrades to the credit ratings of the Company's insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives including those used to hedge benefit guarantees of variable annuities. In some cases, downgrades may give derivative counterparties for over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives and clearing brokers for OTC-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. In addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require collateralization before entering into any new trades. This would restrict the supply of derivative instruments commonly used to hedge variable annuity guarantees, particularly long-dated equity derivatives and interest rate swaps.\nAsset accumulation vehicles primarily require a fixed rate payment, often for a specified period of time, and fixed rate annuities contain surrender values that are based upon a market value adjusted formula if held for shorter periods. In addition, certain products such as corporate owned life insurance contracts and the general account portion of variable annuity products credit interest to policyholders subject to market conditions and minimum interest rate guarantees. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $4,728 and $5,187, respectively, of liabilities for fixed annuities and $120 and $194, respectively, of liabilities for guaranteed investment products.\nVariable Annuity Hedging Program\nFinancial risks include direct and indirect risks to the Company's financial objectives coming from events that impact market conditions or prices. Some events may cause correlated movement in multiple risk factors. The primary sources of financial risks are the Company's general account assets and the liabilities and the guarantees which the company has written over various liability products, particularly its fixed and variable annuity guarantees. Consistent with its risk appetite, the Company establishes financial risk limits to control potential loss on a U.S. GAAP, statutory, and economic basis. Exposures are actively monitored, and mitigated where appropriate. The Company uses various risk management strategies, including reinsurance and over-the-counter and exchange traded derivatives with counterparties meeting the appropriate regulatory and due diligence requirements. Derivatives are utilized to achieve one of four Company-approved objectives: hedging risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; managing liquidity; controlling transaction costs; or entering into synthetic replication transactions. Derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the Company's compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management.\n \u2022 Gross gains and losses on sales were primarily the result of duration, liquidity and credit management within corporate securities, equity securities and U.S Treasuries for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  Variable Annuity Hedge Program\nFee income, earned premiums, and insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased primarily due to the continued run-off of the variable annuity block of business.\n \u2022 Differences in performance of variable subaccounts relative to indices and/or realized equity and interest rate volatilities may affect RBC ratios. \n \u2022 Changes to the underlying hedging program, policyholder behavior, and variation in underlying fund performance relative to the hedged index, which could materially impact the liability; and \nOn October 23, 2017, Moody's Investor Service downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life & Annuity Insurance Company to Baa3 from Baa2.\nInadequate capital resources and liquidity could negatively affect the Company's overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows from its businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.\n [1] For additional information on DAC, see Note 6 - Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n [2] Includes net investment income on short-term investments. \nEach quarter, a committee of investment and accounting professionals evaluates investments to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment ( impairment\u201d) is present for AFS securities or a valuation allowance is required for mortgage loans. This evaluation is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. For further discussion of the accounting policies, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of impairments recorded, see the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments within the Investment Portfolio Risks and Risk Management section of the MD&A.\nInvestment Portfolio Risk\nThe following tables summarize the account values of the Company's variable annuities with guarantee features and the NAR split between various guarantee features (retained net amount at risk does not take into consideration the effects of the variable annuity hedge programs currently in place as of each balance sheet date).\nReinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy\nThe Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by constructing investment portfolios that maintain asset allocation limits and asset/liability duration matching targets which may include the use of derivatives. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models and cash flows simulation under various market scenarios of the liabilities and their supporting investment portfolios. Key metrics that the Company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities include duration, convexity and key rate duration.\nOn December 5, 2017, A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength rating to B++ (Good) from A- (Excellent) and the long-term issuer credit ratings to bbb+ from a- of Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company. Additionally, A.M. Best downgraded the long-term issuer credit rating to bbb- from bbb of Hartford Life Inc. Concurrently, A.M. Best has placed all credit ratings for these entities under review with developing implications.\n\nThe Company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability:\nGuaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments\nAdditionally, the Company holds customized derivative contracts to provide protection from certain capital market risks for the remaining term of specified blocks of non-reinsured GMWB riders. These customized derivative contracts are based on policyholder behavior assumptions specified at the inception of the derivative contracts. The Company retains the risk for differences between assumed and actual policyholder behavior and between the performance of the actively managed funds underlying the separate accounts and their respective indices.\nUse of Credit Derivatives\nInvestments in Limited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments\nInvested Assets Not Supporting Fixed Liabilities\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nwhich oversees controls for the Company's major risk exposures. The topics covered by these updates include The Hartford's activities, policies and procedures to prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, as well as lessons learned from cybersecurity incidents and internal and external testing of our protection measures. FIRMCo meets at each regular Board meeting and is briefed on cyber risks at least annually.\nTax Reform\nThe Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ( FHLBB\u201d). Membership allows the Company access to collateralized advances, which may be used to support various spread-based business and enhance liquidity management. FHLBB membership requires the company to own member stock and advances require the purchase of activity stock. The amount of advances that can be taken are dependent on the asset types pledged to secure the advances. The Connecticut Department of Insurance ( CTDOI\u201d) will permit the Company to pledge up to $0.9 billion in qualifying assets to secure FHLBB advances for 2018. The pledge limit is recalculated annually based on statutory admitted assets and capital and surplus. The Company would need to seek the prior approval of the CTDOI in order to exceed these limits. As of December 31, 2017, HLIC had no advances outstanding under the FHLBB facility.\nTotal general account contractholder obligations are supported by $30 billion of cash and total general account invested assets to meet liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's fixed maturities, short-term investments, and cash are summarized as follows: \nTotal net investment income decreased primarily due to lower asset levels as well as lower income received from previously impaired securities.\nChanges in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities. Based on the fair values of the Company's non-U.S. dollar denominated securities and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, management estimates that a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by an immaterial amount.\n\nWhile the Company actively manages this dynamic hedging program, increased U.S. GAAP earnings volatility may result from factors including, but not limited to: policyholder behavior, capital markets, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, changes in hedging positions and the relative emphasis placed on various risk management objectives.\n\nAfter each quarterly Unlock, the Company also tests the aggregate recoverability of DAC by comparing the DAC balance to the present value of future EGPs. The margin between the DAC balance and the present value of future EGPs for variable annuities was 35% as of December 31, 2017. If the margin between the DAC asset and the present value of future EGPs is exhausted, then further reductions in EGPs would cause portions of DAC to be unrecoverable and the DAC asset would be written down to equal future EGPs.\n \u2022 internal and external risk reporting.  The Company categorizes its main risks as insurance risk, operational risk and financial risk.\n\n [3] Relates to annuities that are recorded in the general account under U.S. GAAP as the contractholders are subject to the Company's credit risk, although these annuities are held in a statutory separate account. In the statutory separate account, the Company is required to maintain invested assets with a fair value greater than or equal to the MVA surrender value of the Fixed MVA contract. In the event assets decline in value at a greater rate than the MVA surrender value of the Fixed MVA contract, the Company is required to contribute additional capital to the statutory separate account. The Company will fund these required contributions with operating cash flows or short-term investments. In the event that operating cash flows or short-term investments are not sufficient to fund required contributions, the Company may have to sell other invested assets at a loss, potentially resulting in a decrease in statutory surplus. As the fair value of invested assets in the statutory separate account are at least equal to the MVA surrender value of the Fixed MVA contract, surrender of Fixed MVA annuities will have an insignificant impact on the liquidity requirements of the Company. \n [2] For additional information on death and other insurance benefit reserves, see Note 7 - Reserves for Future Policy Benefits and Separate Account Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe Unlock charge, after-tax, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to updates to the macro hedging program cost assumption to reflect 2017 activity, and the effect of updates for variable annuities, including a reduction to the assumed general account investment rates, largely offset by separate account returns being above our aggregated estimated returns during the period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the valuation allowances on mortgage loans decreased $19, largely driven by the foreclosure of a loan. Following the conclusion of the loan's foreclosure process, the property transferred at its carrying value, net of the valuation allowance, to a real-estate owned investment during 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, there was no change in valuation allowances on mortgage loans.\n\u2022Identifying and monitoring emerging risks; and\n \u2022 Investing in a portfolio of high-quality and diverse securities; \nThe following tables present the Company's unrealized loss aging for AFS securities by length of time the security was in a continuous unrealized loss position.\nThe Hartford has implemented an information protection program with established governance routines that promote an adaptive approach for assessing and managing risks. The Hartford has invested to build a \u2018defense-in-depth' strategy that uses multiple security measures to protect the integrity of the Company's information assets. This \u2018defense-in-depth' strategy aligns to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework and provides preventative, detective and responsive measures that collectively protects the company. Various cyber assurance methods, including security metrics, third party security assessments, external penetration testing, red team exercises, and cyber war game exercises are used to test the effectiveness of the overall cybersecurity control environment.\nThe following table summarizes the broad Variable Annuity Guarantees offered by the Company and the market risks to which the guarantee is most exposed from a U.S. GAAP accounting perspective.\n\nOn December 4, 2017, The Hartford announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Company's parent, Hartford Life Inc., to a group of investors led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial Group, Pine Brook and J. Safara Group. Prior to the expected close in 2018, the Company anticipates paying an additional $300 in dividends to its parent, subject to approval by the CTDOI. The sale is anticipated to close by June 30, 2018, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.\nThe Company's exposure to equity risk includes the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of its businesses such as variable annuities where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. Declines in equity markets may also decrease the value of limited partnerships and other alternative investments. In addition, the Company offers certain guaranteed benefits, primarily associated with variable annuity products, which increases the Company's potential benefit exposure in periods that equity markets decline. For further discussion of equity risk, see the Managing Equity Risk on Variable Annuity Products section.\nThe annualized net investment income yield, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, decreased slightly to 4.4% in 2017, versus 4.5% in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower income from previously impaired securities as well as lower make-whole payment income on fixed maturities and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans.\nOn December 4, 2017, S&P Global Ratings lowered its issuer credit rating on Hartford Life Inc. to BB/B from BBB/A-2. At the same time, they lowered the issuer and financial strength ratings on Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company to BBB from BBB+. The above ratings were placed on CreditWatch with Negative implications.\n\u2022Conducting business risk assessments and implementing action plans where necessary;\n \u2022 Clearing transactions through central clearing houses that require daily variation margin; \n [4] Includes contracts that had a GMDB at issue but no longer have a GMDB due to certain elections made by policyholders or their beneficiaries. Such contracts had $1.9 billion of account value as of September 30, 2017 and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2016.  Many policyholders with a GMDB also have a GMWB. Policyholders that have a product that offers both guarantees can only receive the GMDB or GMWB. The GMDB NAR disclosed in the preceding tables is a point in time measurement and assumes that all participants utilize the GMDB on that measurement date.\nThe Company utilizes reinsurance to transfer risk to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers. Reinsurance is used to transfer certain risk to reinsurance companies based on specific risk concentrations. All reinsurance processes are aligned under a single enterprise reinsurance risk management policy. Reinsurance purchasing is a centralized function across The Hartford to support a consistent strategy and to ensure that the reinsurance activities are fully integrated into the organization's risk management processes.\nFor further discussion on liquidity see the section on Capital Resources and Liquidity.\nFor most variable annuity contracts, the Company estimates gross profits over 20 years as EGPs emerging subsequent to that time frame are immaterial. Contracts sold in a particular year are aggregated into cohorts. Future gross profits for each cohort are projected over the estimated lives of the underlying contracts, based on future account value projections for variable annuity products. The projection of future account values requires the use of certain assumptions including: separate account returns; separate account fund mix; fees assessed against the contract holder's account balance; full and partial surrender rates; interest credited; mortality; and the extent and duration of hedging activities and hedging costs. Changes in these assumptions and changes to other policyholder behavior assumptions such as GMWB utilization, reaction to price increases, and asset allocations cause EGPs to fluctuate which impacts earnings.\nInsurance operating costs and expenses decreased largely due to the run off of the business requiring less staff and other operating expenses.\nMacro Hedge Program\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the largest issuer concentrations were the state of California, the Oregon School Boards Association, and Ohio American Municipal Power, Inc., which each comprised less than 6% of the municipal bond portfolio and were comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds.\nLimited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments Investment Income\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nMunicipal Bonds\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2017 relates to net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investment and universal life-type contracts of approximately $1.2 billion and the return of capital to the parent of approximately $1.4 billion, partially offset by a $360 net increase in securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Net cash used for financing activities in 2016 relates to net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investment and universal life-type contracts of approximately $0.9 billion and the return of capital to the parent of approximately $0.8 billion. Net cash used for financing activities in 2015 relates to the return of capital to the parent of approximately $1.0 billion and net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investment and universal life-type contracts of approximately $1.3 billion.\nThe new money yield, excluding certain U.S. Treasury securities and cash equivalent securities, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 3.6%, which was below the average yield of sales and maturities of 3.8% for the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the new money yield of 3.6% increased slightly from 3.5% in 2016 largely due to a slight increase in interest rates.\nManagement evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its best estimate,\u201d or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.\n \u2022 The assumptions used in the determination of benefit reserves are prescribed under U.S. STAT, while the assumptions used under U.S. GAAP are generally the Company's best estimates. The methodologies for determining life insurance reserve amounts are also different. For example, reserving for living benefit reserves under U.S. STAT is generally addressed by the Commissioners' Annuity Reserving Valuation Methodology and the related Actuarial Guidelines, while under U.S. GAAP, those same living benefits are either embedded derivatives recorded at fair value or are recorded as additional minimum guarantee benefit reserves. The sensitivity of these life insurance reserves to changes in equity markets, as applicable, will be different between U.S. GAAP and U.S. STAT. \n\nThe Company manages credit risk on an on-going basis through the use of various processes and analyses. Both the investment and reinsurance areas have formulated procedures for counterparty approvals and authorizations, which establish minimum levels of creditworthiness and financial stability. Credits considered for investment are subjected to underwriting reviews. Within the investment portfolio, private securities are subject to committee review for approval. Mitigation strategies vary across the three sources of credit risk, but may include:\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2016, the loss related to the combined GMWB derivatives, net, which include the GMWB product, reinsurance, and hedging derivatives, was primarily driven by losses of $53 due to liability/model assumption updates, $22 due to the effect of increases in equity markets and losses of $12 resulting from regression updates and other changes, partially offset by gains of $40 resulting from policyholder behavior and $29 related to an outperformance of the underlying actively managed funds compared to their respective indices. The macro hedge program loss was primarily due to a loss of $96 due to an increase in equity markets and a loss of $58 driven by time decay on options.  Other, net\n [2] Excludes contracts that are fully reinsured. \nYear ended December 31, 2017\nEvaluation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities and Valuation Allowances on Mortgage Loans\nThe Company uses reinsurance for a portion of contracts with GMWB riders issued prior to the second quarter of 2006. The Company also uses reinsurance for a majority of the GMDB NAR.\nA decline in interest rates results in certain mortgage-backed and municipal securities being more susceptible to paydowns and prepayments or calls. During such periods, the Company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields. Lower interest rates will also likely result in lower net investment income, increased hedging costs associated with variable annuities and, if declines are sustained for a long period of time, it may subject the Company to reinvestment risk and possibly reduced profit margins associated with guaranteed crediting rates on certain products. Conversely, the fair value of the investment portfolio will increase when interest rates decline.\nLimited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments\n \u2022 Other, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to losses of $17 on interest rate derivatives and losses of $13 related to equity derivatives which were hedging against a decline in the equity market on the investment portfolio. \n [2] Includes future minimum lease payments on operating lease agreements. \nA multidisciplinary group of finance, actuarial and risk management professionals reviews and approves changes to the Company's valuation model as well as associated controls.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, impairments recognized in earnings were comprised of intent-to-sell impairments of $4 and credit impairments of $22, both of which were primarily concentrated in corporate securities. Also, impairments recognized in earnings included impairments on equity securities of $2 that were in an unrealized loss position and the Company no longer believed the securities would recover in the foreseeable future.\nEstimated gross profits ( EGPs\u201d) are used in the valuation and amortization of the DAC asset. Portions of EGPs are also used in the valuation of reserves for death and other insurance benefit features on variable annuity and other universal life-type contracts.\n(Dollar amounts in millions unless otherwise stated)\nFrom a governance perspective, senior members of our Enterprise Risk Management, Information Protection and Internal Audit functions provide detailed, regular reports on cybersecurity matters to The Hartford's Board, including the Finance, Investment, and Risk Management Committee (FIRMCo), which has principal responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity risk, and/or the Audit Committee,\nFinancial Risk on Statutory Capital\n \u2022 Non-renewing policies/contracts or reinsurance treaties.  The Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Aggregate counterparty credit quality and exposure is monitored on a daily basis utilizing an enterprise-wide credit exposure information system that contains data on issuers, ratings, exposures, and credit limits. Exposures are tracked on a current and potential basis and aggregated by ultimate parent across investments, reinsurance receivables, insurance products with credit risk, and derivative counterparties.\nThe Unlock charge, after-tax, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the reduction of the fixed annuity DAC balance to zero, updates to the macro hedging program cost to reflect 2016 activity, and the effect of assumption updates for variable annuities, including to mortality. These impacts were partially offset by separate account returns being above our aggregated estimated\nLiabilities\nVariable Annuity Market Risk Exposures\nThe Company expects to incur GMDB payments in the future only if the policyholder has an in the money\u201d GMDB at their death. For policies with a GMWB rider, the company expects to incur GMWB payments in the future only if the account value is reduced over time to a specified level through a combination of market performance and periodic withdrawals, at which point the contractholder will receive an annuity equal to the GRB which is generally equal to premiums less withdrawals. For the Company's lifetime\u201d GMWB products, this annuity can exceed the GRB. As the account value fluctuates with equity market returns on a daily basis and the lifetime\u201d GMWB payments may exceed the GRB, the ultimate amount to be paid by the Company, if any, is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than the Company's current carried liability. For additional information on the Company's GMWB liability, see Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on the Company's GMDB liability, see Note 7 - Reserves for Future Policy Benefits and Separate Account Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 Costs incurred by the Company to acquire insurance policies are deferred under U.S. GAAP while those costs are expensed immediately under U.S. STAT. \n\nMarket Unlocks\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nFinancial Risk Management\nLiquidity risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings or capital arising from the Company's inability or perceived inability to meet its contractual funding obligations when they come due.\nCapital Market Derivatives\nGMWB Hedge Program\nInvestment Portfolio Composition\n \u2022 estimated gross profits used in the valuation and amortization of assets and liabilities associated with variable annuity and other universal life-type contracts; \nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOperating cash flows in all periods have been adequate to meet liquidity requirements.\n\u2022Purchasing insurance coverage.\nOperational risk can result in financial loss, disruption of our business, regulatory actions or damage to our reputation.\nEuropean Exposure\n\nThe decrease in DAC amortization was primarily driven by the effect of a favorable unlock in 2017 compared to an unfavorable unlock in 2016. For further discussion of the unlock, see MD&A - Estimated Gross Profits.\nRisk-based Capital\nCredit Risk of Derivatives\nManaging the Credit Risk of Counterparties to Derivative Instruments\n \u2022 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and \nThe Company's issued non-investment type contracts include structured settlement contracts, terminal funding agreements, and on-benefit payout annuities (i.e., the annuitant is currently receiving benefits). The cash outflows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing. Similar to investment-type products, the aggregate cash flow payment streams are relatively predictable. Products in this category may rely upon actuarial pricing assumptions (including mortality and morbidity) and have an element of cash flow uncertainty. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $6,841 and $6,887, respectively of liabilities for structured settlements and terminal funding agreements and $1,627 and $1,636, respectively, of liabilities for on-benefit payout annuities.\nValuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments\nThe Company determines EGPs from a single deterministic reversion to mean ( RTM\u201d) separate account return projection which is an estimation technique commonly used by insurance entities to project future separate account returns. Through this estimation technique, the Company's DAC model is adjusted to reflect actual fund performance at the end of each quarter. Through consideration of recent market returns, the Company will unlock, or adjust, projected returns over a future period so that the account value returns to the long-term expected rate of return, providing that those projected returns do not exceed certain caps.\nThe following ratings actions were announced in connection with The Hartford's definitive agreement to sell Hartford Life Inc. and its life and annuity operating subsidiaries, Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company.\n\nFor further discussion on the impact of fair value changes from living benefits see Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and for a discussion on the sensitivities of certain living benefits due to capital market factors see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Variable Product Guarantee Risks and Risk Management.\nThe following table presents the Company's AFS securities by type, as well as fixed maturities and equity, FVO. \n\nFixed Liabilities and the Invested Assets Supporting Them\nEquity risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of global equities or equity indices. The Company has exposure to equity risk from assets under management and embedded derivatives within the Company's variable annuities. Equity Risk on the Company's Variable Annuity products is mitigated through various hedging programs. For further information, refer to Enterprise Risk Management, Managing Equity Risk on Variable Annuity Products.\n [4] Surrenders of, or policy loans taken from, as applicable, these general account liabilities, may be funded through operating cash flows of the Company, available short-term investments, or the Company may be required to sell fixed maturity investments to fund the surrender payment. These obligations include the general account option for individual variable annuities and the variable life contracts of the former Individual Life business, the general account option for annuities of the former Retirement Plans business and universal life contracts sold by the former Individual Life business. Sales of fixed maturity investments could result in the recognition of significant realized losses and insufficient proceeds to fully fund the surrender amount. In this circumstance, the Company may need to take other actions, including enforcing certain contract provisions which could restrict surrenders and/or slow or defer payouts. The Company has ceded reinsurance in connection with the sales of its Retirement Plans and Individual Life businesses to MassMutual and Prudential, respectively. The reinsurance transactions do not extinguish the Company's primary liability on the insurance policies issued under these businesses. \nComposition of Invested Assets\n \u2022 Requiring collateral; and \nINVESTMENT RESULTS\nThe Company has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company's exposure to credit risk. The Company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company's policies with respect to derivative counterparty exposure establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company's risk management team and reviewed by senior management.\nNon-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities and cash\nAggregate Recoverability\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred no losses on derivative instruments due to counterparty default.\nThe majority of the Company's credit risk is concentrated in its investment holdings but it is also present in the Company's reinsurance and insurance portfolios. A decline in creditworthiness is typically associated with an increase in an investment's credit spread, potentially resulting in an increase in other-than-temporary impairments and an increased probability of a realized loss upon sale. Premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables are also subject to credit risk based on the counterparty's unwillingness or inability to pay.\nIn connection with the pending sale of HLI and subsidiaries, the Company will forego approximately $460 of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryovers and foreign tax credits that will be retained by The Hartford. These deferred tax assets continue to be reflected as an asset in the accompanying financial statements as non-recoverability is contingent on the closing of the sale of the business.\nThe MD&A addresses the financial condition of Hartford Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries ( Hartford Life Insurance Company\u201d or the Company\u201d) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the comparable 2016 periods. Management's narrative analysis of the results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction I (2) (a) of Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes beginning on page. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation.\nThe objective of the Company's enterprise credit risk management strategy is to identify, quantify, and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis and to limit potential losses in accordance with an established credit risk management policy. The Company primarily manages its credit risk by holding a diversified mix of investment grade issuers and counterparties across its investment, reinsurance, and insurance portfolios. Potential losses are also limited within portfolios by diversifying across geographic regions, asset types, and sectors.\nThe Company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield. The Company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity, referenced index, or asset pool. The Company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that purchase credit protection was $80 and $131, respectively, while the fair value was $(3) and $(3), respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.\nOperating Summary\nThe fair values of the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $104 and $77, respectively. Included in these amounts are $5 and $5 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities that directly support liabilities denominated in the same currencies. The currency risk of the remaining non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities are hedged with foreign currency swaps. The Company holds $216 of yen-denominated cash, of which $214 is derivative cash collateral pledged by counterparties and has an offsetting collateral liability. In addition, the Company holds $306 of euro-denominated cash which is hedged with foreign currency forwards.\nUse of Estimated Gross Profits in Amortization and Reserving\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2017 primarily relates to net proceeds from available-for-sale securities of approximately $1.6 billion. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2016 primarily relates to net proceeds from available-for-sale securities of approximately $1.5 billion, partially offset by net payments for short-term investments of $769. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2015 primarily relates to net proceeds from short-term investments of approximately $1.6 billion.\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, or from external events. Operational risk is inherent in the Company's business and functional areas. Operational risks include legal; cyber and information security; models; third party vendors; technology; operations; business continuity; disaster recovery; internal and external fraud; and compliance.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to decreases in claims and benefits paid as well as a decrease in operating expenses, largely offset by a decrease in fee income and federal income tax refunds.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans \nCredit Risk\nThe Company hedged the foreign currency risk associated with these liability contracts with currency rate swaps. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the derivatives used to hedge foreign currency exchange risk related to foreign denominated liability contracts had a total notional amount of $94 and $94, and a total fair value of $(11) and $(25), respectively.\nManaging Equity Risk on Variable Annuity Products\n\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nThe Company's investment in the financial services sector is predominantly through investment grade banking and insurance institutions. The following table presents the Company's fixed maturities and equity, AFS securities in the financial services sector that are included in the preceding Securities by Type table.\nThe fair value of fixed income investments, which include fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, and short-term investments, was $26.8 billion and $28.1 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The weighted average duration of the portfolio, including derivative instruments, was approximately 7.6 years and 6.8 years as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNon-credit impairments recognized in other comprehensive income were $2 for the year ended December 31, 2017. These non-credit impairments represent the excess of the Company's best estimate of the discounted future cash flows over the fair value.\n [1] These sensitivities are based on the following key market levels as of December 31, 2017: 1) S&P of 2,674; 2) 10yr US swap rate of 2.42%; and 3) S&P 10yr volatility of 23.80%. \nThe Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better. The Company also generally requires that OTC derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\"ISDA\") Master Agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. The Company enters into credit support annexes in conjunction with the ISDA agreements, which require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds.\nFixed Income Investments\nThe Hartford has an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ( HFSG Holding Company\u201d) and certain affiliates of up to $2.0 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Connecticut Insurance Department (\"CTDOI\") granted approval for certain affiliated insurance companies that are parties to the agreement to treat receivables from a parent, including the HFSG Holding Company, as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding from the HFSG Holding Company.\nThe Hartford's Board of Directors ( the Board\u201d) has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, as described more fully in The Hartford's Proxy Statement, while management is tasked with the day-to-day management of The Hartford's risks.\nDerivative Commitments\nSources of Liquidity Risk include funding risk, company-specific liquidity risk and market liquidity risk resulting from differences in the amount and timing of sources and uses of cash as well as company-specific and general market conditions. Stressed market conditions may impact the ability to sell assets or otherwise transact business and may result in a significant loss in value.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed a comprehensive policyholder behavior assumption study which resulted in a non-market related after-tax charge of $35 and incorporated the results of that study into its projection of future gross profits. Additionally, throughout the year, the Company evaluates various aspects of policyholder behavior and will revise its policyholder assumptions if credible emerging data indicates that changes are warranted. The Company will continue to evaluate its assumptions related to policyholder behavior as initiatives to reduce the size of the annuity business are implemented by management. Upon completion of an annual assumption study or evaluation of credible new information, the Company will revise its assumptions to reflect its current best estimate. These assumption revisions will change the projected account values and the related EGPs in the DAC amortization models, as well as the death and other insurance benefit reserving model.\nThe Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day's market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives exceed the contractual thresholds. In accordance with industry standard and the contractual agreements, collateral is typically settled on same business day. The Company has exposure to credit risk\nThe fair value of AFS securities decreased, as compared with December 31, 2016, due to the continued run-off of the Company's business. Fixed maturities, FVO, are not included in the preceding table. For further discussion on FVO securities, see Note 2 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments related to the businesses included in the table above was $8.8 billion and $9.8 billion, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. The Company's sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.\nThe Company's stockholder's equity, as prepared using U.S. GAAP, was $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. The Company's estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus, as prepared in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual ( U.S. STAT\u201d), was $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInsurance Operations\nLegal Proceedings\n\nreturns during the period, largely due to an increase in equity markets, as well as the effect of reducing the assumption about expected future lapses of variable annuities.\nAs part of the Company's ongoing security monitoring process, the Company has reviewed its AFS securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that these securities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the securities approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. For these securities in an unrealized loss position where a credit impairment has not been recorded, the Company's best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities. For further information regarding the Company's impairment analysis, see Other-Than-Temporary Impairments in the Investment Portfolio Risks and Risk Management section of this MD&A.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities - Unrealized Loss Aging\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had no valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies. From time to time, tax planning strategies could include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery, making investments which have specific tax characteristics, and business considerations such as asset-liability matching. Management views such tax planning strategies as prudent and feasible and would implement them, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAnnual Unlock of Assumptions\nAn increase in interest rates from current levels is generally a favorable development for the Company. Interest rate increases are expected to provide additional net investment income, reduce the cost of the variable annuity hedging program, and limit the potential risk of margin erosion due to minimum guaranteed crediting rates in certain products. However, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time period, certain businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk refers to the risk that policyholders will surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment requiring the Company to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. An increase in interest rates may also impact the Company's tax planning strategies and in particular its ability to utilize tax benefits of previously recognized realized capital losses.\n\n\nThe agencies consider many factors in determining the final rating of an insurance company. One consideration is the relative level of statutory capital and surplus, (referred to collectively as \"statutory capital\") necessary to support the business written and is reported in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the applicable state insurance department.\nINDEX\nThe open foreign currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using currency futures/forwards/swaps. In order to manage the currency risk related to any non-U.S. dollar denominated liability contracts, the Company enters into foreign currency swaps or holds non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.\n [1] Primarily relates to derivative instruments.  Total investments decreased since December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of a decline in fixed maturities, AFS, and short-term investments. The decrease in fixed maturities, AFS was primarily the result of the continued runoff of the Company's business. The decrease in short-term investments was primarily due to a dividend payout and the reinvestment of short-term investments held as of December 31, 2016 into other asset classes.\n\nThrough December 31, 2017, commercial real estate market conditions, including property prices, occupancies, financial conditions, transaction volume, and delinquencies, remained mostly favorable and delinquencies remained very low. In addition, the availability of credit has has been adequate to refinance loans that have come due.\nThe components of the gross and net reinsurance recoverables are summarized as follows: \n\n [1] Primarily consists of changes in value of non-qualifying derivatives including credit derivatives and interest rate derivatives used to manage duration.  Gross Gains and Losses on Sales\nNon-U.S. dollar denominated funding agreement liability contracts\n[1] Pre-Refunded bonds are bonds for which an irrevocable trust containing sufficient U.S. treasury, agency, or other securities has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest.\nRisk Hedging\nAll assumption changes that affect the estimate of future EGPs including: the update of current account values; the use of the RTM estimation technique; and policyholder behavior assumptions are considered an Unlock in the period of revision. An Unlock adjusts DAC and death and other insurance benefit reserve balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with an offsetting benefit or charge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of the revision. An Unlock that results in an after-tax benefit generally occurs as a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being favorable compared to previous estimates. An Unlock that results in an after-tax charge generally occurs as a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being unfavorable compared to previous estimates.\nCertain of the Company's derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity's financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity's ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2017, was $692. Of this $692 the legal entities have posted collateral of $847, which is inclusive of initial margin requirements, in the normal course of business. In addition, the Company has posted collateral of $31 associated with a customized GMWB derivative. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2017, a downgrade of one or two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody's or S&P would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. These collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the collateral that we would post, if required, would be primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and government agency securities.\n \u2022 The impact of elapsed time on liabilities or hedge assets, any non-parallel shifts in capital market factors, or correlated moves across the sensitivities.  In December 2017, the Company added hedge positions in the macro hedge program to reduce open equity risk exposure, which increased the sensitivity that changes in equity market returns would have on GAAP net income.\nBenefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased due to lower death benefits and interest credited primarily due to the continued run-off of the variable annuity block of business.\nThe Company also enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company's investment policies. These swaps reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include customized diversified portfolios of corporate issuers, which are established within sector concentration limits and may be divided into tranches which possess different credit ratings. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that assume credit risk was $380 and $458, respectively, while the fair value was $3 and $4, respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.\nFor a discussion regarding Guaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n [1] Yields calculated using annualized net investment income divided by the monthly average invested assets at cost, amortized cost, or adjusted carrying value, as applicable, excluding repurchase agreement and securities lending collateral, if any, and derivatives book value. \nThe calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in net economic value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nThe Hartford, like many other large financial services companies, blocks attempted cyber intrusions on a daily basis. In the event of a cyber intrusion, the company invokes its Cyber Incident Response Program commensurate with the nature of the intrusion. While the actual methods employed differ based on the event, our approach employs internal teams and outside advisors with specialized skills to support the response and recovery efforts and requires elevation of issues, as necessary, to senior management.\nDividends to the Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer's policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer's earned surplus or certain other thresholds as calculated under applicable state insurance law, the dividend requires the prior approval of the domestic regulator. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiary, regulatory capital requirements and liquidity requirements of the individual operating company.\nThe Company's variable annuity hedging program is primarily focused, through the use of reinsurance and capital market derivative instruments, on reducing the economic exposure to market risks associated with guaranteed benefits that are embedded in our variable annuity contracts. The variable annuity hedging program also considers the potential impacts on statutory capital.\nThe effective tax rate differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% in 2017 and 2016, primarily due to a charge of $396 as a result of Tax Reform enacted in December, 2017. Among other changes, Tax Reform reduced the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 which resulted in a reduction of the Company's net deferred tax assets, including its net operating loss carryovers. For a reconciliation of the income tax provision at the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes, see Note 9 - Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nRatings\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, impairments recognized in earnings were comprised of credit impairments of $14. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there were no securities that the Company intends to sell (\"intent-to-sell impairments\") or impairments on equity securities.\n \u2022 risk identification and assessment; \nTotal net investment income decreased primarily due to lower asset levels as well as lower income received from previously impaired securities. For further discussion, see MD&A - Investments Results, Net Investment Income.\n [1] Each of these guarantees and the related U.S. GAAP accounting volatility will also be influenced by actual and estimated policyholder behavior. \nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's European investment exposure had an amortized cost and fair value of $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, or 6% of total invested assets; as of December 31, 2016, amortized cost and fair value totaled $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The investment exposure largely relates to corporate entities which are domiciled in or generate a significant portion of their revenue within the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the weighted average credit quality of European investments was BBB+ and A-, respectively. Entities domiciled in the United Kingdom comprise the Company's largest exposure; as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the U.K. exposure totals less than 3% of total invested assets and largely relates to industrial and financial services securities and has an average credit rating of BBB+. The majority of the European investments are U.S. dollar-denominated, and those securities that are British pound or euro-denominated are hedged to U.S. dollars. For a discussion of foreign currency risks, see the Foreign Currency Exchange Risk section of this MD&A.\nDividends\nOn October 23, 2017, Moody's lowered its counterparty credit and insurer financial strength ratings on Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company to Baa3. Given this downgrade action, termination rating triggers in two derivative counterparty relationships in which the Company has open derivative contracts were impacted. The Company has successfully re-negotiated the rating triggers with these counterparties. Accordingly, the Company does not expect the current hedging programs to be adversely impacted by the announcement of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Hartford Life Insurance Company. In addition, as a result of the downgrade of Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, the Company is required to post an additional $9 of collateral related to a single counterparty relationship.\nThe Company has exposure to commercial mortgage loans as presented in the following table. These loans are collateralized by a variety of commercial properties and are diversified both geographically throughout the United States and by property type. These loans are primarily in the form of whole loans, where the Company is the sole lender, but may include participations. Loan participations are loans where the Company has purchased or retained a portion of an outstanding loan or package of loans and participates on a pro-rata basis in collecting interest and principal pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement. As of December 31, 2017, loans within the Company's mortgage loan portfolio that have had extensions or restructurings other than what is allowable under the original terms of the contract are immaterial.\nfor amounts below the exposure thresholds which are uncollateralized, as well as for market fluctuations that may occur between contractual settlement periods of collateral movements.\nTotal gross unrealized losses were $73 as of December 31, 2017, and have improved $133, or 65%, from December 31, 2016, due to tighter credit spreads. As of December 31, 2017, $71 of the gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The remaining $2 of gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed greater than 20%. The securities depressed more than 20% are primarily securities with exposure to commercial real estate and corporate securities in the energy sector that decreased in value primarily due to wider credit spreads since the securities were purchased.\nReinsurance\nYear ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table presents our estimates of the potential instantaneous impacts from sudden market stresses related to equity market prices, interest rates, and implied market volatilities. The following sensitivities represent: (1) the net estimated difference between the change in the fair value of GMWB liabilities and the underlying hedge instruments and (2) the estimated change in fair value of the hedge instruments for the macro program, before the impacts of amortization of DAC and taxes. As noted in the preceding discussion, certain hedge assets are used to hedge liabilities that are not carried at fair value and will not have a liability offset in the U.S. GAAP sensitivity analysis. All sensitivities are measured as of December 31, 2017 and are related to the fair value of liabilities and hedge instruments in place at that date for the Company's variable annuity hedge programs. The impacts presented in the table that follows are estimated individually and measured without consideration of any correlation among market risk factors.\nThe Company's issued investment contracts and certain insurance product liabilities, other than non-guaranteed separate accounts, include asset accumulation vehicles such as fixed annuities, guaranteed investment products, and other investment and universal life-type contracts. The primary risk associated with these products is that, despite the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns.\n\n [1] No allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was required as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company has reinsurance recoverables from MassMutual and Prudential of $8.3 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has reinsurance recoverables from MassMutual and Prudential of $8.6 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. The Company's obligations to its direct policyholders that have been reinsured to MassMutual and Prudential are secured by invested assets held in trust. As of December 31, 2017, net of invested assets held in trust, the Company has no reinsurance-related concentrations of credit risk greater than 10% of the Company's Consolidated Stockholder's Equity.\nENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n\n [4] Includes consumer notes of $8. Consumer notes include principal payments, contractual interest for fixed rate notes, and interest based on current rates for floating rate notes. \n \u2022 Selling investments subject to credit risk; \nThe Company has entered into pay U.S. dollar, receive yen swap contracts to hedge the currency exposure between the U.S. dollar denominated assets and the yen denominated fixed liability reinsurance payments.\n [1] Includes securities with pools of loans issued by the Small Business Administration which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  The decline in the fair value of AFS securities as compared to December 31, 2016 was due to the continued run-off of the Company's business, partially offset by an increase in valuations due to tighter credit spreads.\nIn addition to updating assumptions in the fourth quarter of each year, an Unlock revises EGPs, on a quarterly basis, to reflect the Company's current best estimate assumptions and market updates of policyholder account value. The Unlock for future separate account returns is determined each quarter. Under RTM, the expected long term rate of return is 8.3%. The annual return assumed over the next five years of approximately (0.4)% was calculated based on the return needed over that period to produce an 8.3% return since March of 2009, the date the Company adopted the RTM estimation technique to project future separate account returns. Based on the expected trend of policy lapses and annuitizations, the Company expects approximately 55% of its block of variable annuities to runoff in the next 5 years.\n \u2022 Entering into contracts only with strong creditworthy institutions \n Net Investment Income \nAs of December 31, 2017, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of derivative relationships that could be subject to immediate termination in the event of a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings was $1.5 billion and $12, respectively. These amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated.\nContingencies Relating to Corporate Litigation and Regulatory Matters\n \u2022 Hedging through use of single name or basket credit default swaps; \n \u2022 Temporary differences between the book and tax basis of an asset or liability which are recorded as deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability under U.S. GAAP while those amounts deferred are subject to limitations under U.S. STAT. \nEquity Risk\n\u2022Validating existing crisis management protocols;\nThe Company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. Legal personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a reasonable possibility of loss. These matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the appropriate disclosure. The outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the Company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are subject to significant changes. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the Company. In view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the Company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations and liquidity in a particular quarterly or annual period.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n[2] Leasing revenue bonds are generally the obligations of a financing authority established by the municipality that leases facilities back to a municipality. The notes are typically secured by lease payments made by the municipality that is leasing the facilities financed by the issue. Lease payments may be subject to annual appropriation by the municipality or the municipality may be obligated to appropriate general tax revenues to make lease payments.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Company has exposure to interest rates arising from its fixed maturity securities and interest sensitive liabilities. In addition, certain product liabilities, including those containing GMWB or GMDB, expose the Company to interest rate risk but also have significant equity risk. These liabilities are discussed as part of the Variable Product Guarantee Risks and Risk Management section. Management also evaluates performance of certain products based on net investment spread which is, in part, influenced by changes in interest rates.\nForeign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies. The Company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, which primarily consist of fixed maturity and equity investments, foreign denominated cash and a yen denominated fixed payout annuity.\n [3] Included in purchase obligations is $40 relating to contractual commitments to purchase various goods and services such as maintenance and information technology in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty, or contracts that do not specify minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased. \n \u2022 living benefits required to be fair valued (in other policyholder funds and benefits payable); \nDeferred tax assets represent the tax benefit of future deductible temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized if there is no change in tax law. Under U.S. GAAP, we test the value of deferred tax assets for impairment on a quarterly basis at the entity level within each tax jurisdiction, consistent with our filed tax returns. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we have considered all available evidence as of December 31, 2017 including past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions.\nThe following table presents the Company's impairments recognized in earnings by security type.\nThe underlying guaranteed withdrawal benefit liabilities (excluding the life contingent portion of GMWB contracts) and hedge assets within the GMWB hedge and Macro hedge programs are carried at fair value.\nFixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments and Free-standing Derivatives\nThe following table presents the Company's unrealized loss aging for AFS securities continuously depressed over 20% by length of time (also included in the table above).\nCapital resources and liquidity represent the overall strength of Hartford Life Insurance Company and its ability to generate strong cash flows, borrow funds at competitive rates and to meet operating needs over the next twelve months.\n \u2022 Decreases in the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, may reduce statutory surplus and RBC ratios. \nThe Company cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers to enable the Company to manage capital and risk exposure. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company.\nIncluded in the following table is the before-tax change in the net economic value of investment contracts including structured settlements, fixed annuity contracts and terminal funding agreements for which the payment rates are fixed at contract issuance and/or the investment experience is substantially absorbed by the Company's operations, along with the corresponding invested assets. Also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by the Company to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the investment portfolios supporting these contracts. This analysis does not include the assets and corresponding liabilities of certain insurance products such as certain life contingent annuities. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments. Insulated separate account assets and liabilities are excluded from the analysis because gains and losses in separate accounts accrue to policyholders.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017: \nLiving Benefits Required to be Fair Valued\nThe Unlock charge in the table above includes both assumption unlocks and market unlocks.\n [3] Primarily includes income from derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting and hedge fixed maturities.  Year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose risk-based capital ( RBC\u201d) requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, based on its size and risk profile. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's total adjusted capital ( TAC\u201d) to its authorized control level RBC ( ACL RBC\u201d). Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The minimum level of TAC before corrective action commences ( Company Action Level\u201d) is two times the ACL RBC. The adequacy of a company's capital is determined by the ratio of a company's TAC to its Company Action Level, known as the \"RBC ratio\". The Company and all of its operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations. The RBC ratios for the Company and its principal life insurance operating subsidiaries were all in excess of 300% of their Company Action Levels as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The reporting of RBC ratios is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company, or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities.\nThe Company uses reinsurance for a portion of contracts with GMWB riders issued prior to the second quarter of 2006. The Company also uses reinsurance for a majority of the GMDB NAR.\n [1] The vintage year represents the year the pool of loans was originated. \n \u2022 the development of risk appetites, tolerances, and limits; \nAt the end of 2017, Congress passed and the president signed, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\"), which enacted significant reforms to the U.S. tax code. The major areas of interest to the Company include the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and the refunding of AMT credits. We continue to analyze Tax Reform for other potential impacts. The U.S. Treasury and IRS will develop guidance implementing Tax Reform, and Congress may consider additional technical corrections to the legislation. Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by Congress and/or the U.S. Treasury Department could have a material effect on the Company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear.

overview of Hartford Life Insurance Company's financial performance and condition for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Key points include:\n\n- Net loss was $46 million in 2017 compared to net income of $282 million in 2016, primarily due to a one-time $396 million charge related to tax reform. \n\n- Total revenues decreased to $2.2 billion in 2017 from $2.4 billion in 2016, driven by lower fee income, earned premiums, and net investment income.\n\n- Net investment income was $1.3 billion in 2017 versus $1.4 billion in 2016. The decrease was due to lower asset levels and income from previously impaired securities.\n\n- Net realized capital losses were $60 million in 2017 compared to $163 million in 2016. The improvement was due to lower impairments and gains on sales.\n\n- The fair value of investments declined to $29.6 billion at December 31, 2017 from $30.9 billion at December 31, 2016, mainly due to the run-off of the business.\n\n- Estimated gross profits are used to value deferred acquisition costs and certain policyholder liabilities. Assumption updates in 2017 resulted in a $11 million after-tax charge.\n\n- The company actively manages interest rate risk, equity risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and other financial risks through investment policies, hedging programs, and risk limits. \n\n- Capital resources remained strong with a consolidated stockholder's equity of $6.7 billion and estimated statutory capital and surplus of $3.6 billion at December 31, 2017.\n\nIn summary, the company's financial performance declined in 2017 primarily due to tax reform, but capital resources remain strong. The company is managing risks through established policies and programs."}
