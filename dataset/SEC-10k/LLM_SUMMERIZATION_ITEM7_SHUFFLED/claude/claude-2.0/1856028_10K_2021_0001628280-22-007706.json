Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExcept as otherwise indicated or required by the context, all references in this prospectus to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d relate to Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. ( Stronghold Inc.\u201d) and its consolidated subsidiaries following the Reorganization.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans, expectations and strategy for our business, and operations, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see section above entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risks may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion and analysis. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those described under the heading Risk Factors\u201d and discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a vertically integrated crypto asset mining company currently focused on mining Bitcoin. We wholly own and operate two low-cost, environmentally-beneficial coal refuse power generation facilities that we have upgraded: (i) our first reclamation facility located on a 650-acre site in Scrubgrass Township, Venango County, Pennsylvania, which we acquired the remaining interest of in April 2021 and currently has the capacity to generate approximately 83.5 megawatts (\"MW\") of electricity (the \"Scrubgrass Plant\") and (ii) a facility located near Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania, which we acquired in November of 2021 and which has the capacity to generate approximately 80 MW of electricity (the \"Panther Creek Plant\"), each of which are recognized as an Alternative Energy System because coal refuse is classified under Pennsylvania law as a Tier II Alternative Energy Source (large-scale hydropower is also classified in this tier). We are committed to generating our energy and managing our assets sustainably, and we believe that we are one of the first vertically integrated crypto asset mining companies with a focus on environmentally beneficial operations. Owning our own source of power helps us to produce Bitcoin at one of the lowest prices among our publicly traded peers. We also believe that owning our own power source makes us a more attractive partner to crypto asset mining equipment purveyors. We completed our previously disclosed acquisition of a second coal refuse power generation facility and have entered into a non-binding letter of intent to purchase a third coal refuse power generation facility (the \"Third Plant\"). We intend to leverage these competitive advantages to continue to grow our business through the opportunistic acquisition of additional power generating assets and miners.\nBitcoin Mining Growth\nDuring 2018 and 2019, we began providing Bitcoin mining services to third parties and also began operating our own Bitcoin mining equipment to generate Bitcoin, which we then exchange for U.S. Dollars. We have been expanding our mining operations since such date. As of December 31, 2021 we operated approximately 8,000 crypto asset mining computers (known as miners\u201d) with hash rate exceeding 0.8 EH/s. As of December 31, 2021 we had entered into definitive agreements with suppliers to purchase approximately 39,000 additional miners, including the remaining MinerVa Semiconductor Corp. (\"MinerVa\") miners that were not yet delivered at year end, with a total hash capacity equal to approximately 4.0 EH/s. We do not know when the remaining 11,700 MinerVa miners will be delivered, if at all. Additionally, we are evaluating all available remedies under the MinerVa Purchase Agreement (as defined herein). We intend to house our miners at the Scrubgrass Plant, the Panther Creek Plant, the Third Plant or other power assets that we identify.\nWith the full deployment of these new miners, including the remaining 11,700 MinerVa miners, which we do not know when they will be delivered, if at all, our total fleet is currently expected to comprise approximately 57,000 total miners by December 2022 and consume approximately 200 MW of electricity.\nTrends and Other Factors Impacting Our Performance\nCOVID-19 and Supply Chain Constraints\nThe coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") global pandemic has resulted and is likely to continue to result in significant national and global economic disruption, which may adversely affect our business. Among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas caused supply chain disruptions that may have lasting impacts. Additionally, the global supply chain for Bitcoin miners is presently further constrained due to unprecedented demand coupled with a global shortage of mining equipment and mining equipment parts. Based on our current assessments, however, we do not expect any material impact on long-term development, operations, or liquidity due to the spread of COVID-19. However, we are actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, and industry.\nChina's Crackdown on Bitcoin Mining\nIn May 2021, the Chinese government called for a crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading. Following this, the majority of Bitcoin miners in China were taken offline. This resulted in (i) a significant reduction in the Bitcoin global network hash rate, (ii) an increase in the availability of Bitcoin miners for purchase and (iii) an increase in the demand for power outside of China. Further, in September 2021, Chinese regulators instituted a blanket ban on all crypto mining and transactions, including overseas crypto exchange services taking place in China, effectively making all crypto-related activities illegal in China. The reduction in network hash rate has improved Bitcoin mining profitability, with plugged-in Bitcoin miners representing a larger percentage of the global hash rate. We do not believe that higher demand for power will have a negative impact on our business because we own and operate our power sources.\nScrubgrass Plant\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing into 2022, the Scrubgrass Plant had downtime that was greater than anticipated, driven largely by mechanical failures. The upgrades and maintenance that are necessary have taken longer and are more extensive than originally anticipated. We expect these investments to be completed in the second half of 2022. Once finished, the Scrubgrass Plant is expected to be operational at nameplate capacity with high uptime and low operating costs.\n2021 Highlights\nAcquisitions\nOn March 3, 2021, Stronghold Digital Mining LLC ( SDM\u201d) entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Olympus Power, LLC (together with its affiliates, \"Olympus\") (the Olympus LOI\u201d) for the purchase of (i) the ownership interest in Scrubgrass Reclamation Company, L.P. (f/k/a Scrubgrass Generating Company, L.P.) ( Scrubgrass LP\u201d) held by Aspen Scrubgrass Participant, LLC (the Aspen Interest\u201d), (ii) the Panther Creek Plant, and (iii) the Third Plant.\nOn July 9, 2021, Stronghold Digital Mining Holdings LLC ( Stronghold LLC\u201d) entered into a purchase agreement for the Panther Creek Plant (the Panther Creek Acquisition\u201d), as contemplated by the Olympus LOI, from Olympus. The Panther Creek Acquisition includes all of the assets of Panther Creek Power Operating LLC, comprised primarily of the Panther Creek Plant. The Panther Creek Plant is a coal refuse reclamation facility with 80 MW of net electricity generation capacity located near Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania. We completed the Panther Creek Acquisition on November 2, 2021. The consideration for the Panther Creek Plant was approximately $2.2 million ($3 million less $800 thousand in shared land closing costs) in cash and 1,152,000 Class A common units of Stronghold LLC ( Stronghold LLC Units\u201d), together with a corresponding number of shares of Class V common stock. Effective November 2, 2021, we closed on this acquisition. Refer to \"Note 25 - Acquisition\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nWe continue to evaluate the acquisition of the Third Plant as contemplated by the Olympus LOI, although the acquisition of the Third Plant is subject to further due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement, and there is no assurance that the acquisition will be completed. The acquisition of the Third Plant is subject to further due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement, and there is no assurance that the acquisition will be completed. The consideration for the Third Plant is expected to be approximately $3.0 million in cash and 6,250,000 of Stronghold LLC Units, together with a corresponding number of shares of Class V common stock. If acquired, we plan to store newly acquired miners at or near the Third Plant and use power generated by the Third Plant to power crypto asset mining operations in an environmentally conscious manner. We are also strategically pursuing acquisitions of additional assets.\nNorthern Data\nOn August 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Northern Data PA, LLC ( Northern Data\u201d) whereby Northern Data will construct and operate a colocation datacenter facility located on the Scrubgrass Plant (the Hosting Agreement\u201d), the primary business purpose of which will be to provide hosting services and support the cryptocurrency miners that we have purchased but not yet received entirely. On March 28, 2022, we restructured the Hosting Agreement to obtain an\nadditional 2,675 miners at cost of $37.5 per terahash (to be paid five months after delivery) and temporarily reduced the profit share for Northern Data while incorporating performance thresholds until the data center build-out is complete. Refer to \"Note 28 - Hosting Services Agreement\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nInitial Public Offering\nWe completed the issuance and sale of our Class A common stock, par value $.0001 per share, in an initial public offering (the \"IPO\") on October 22, 2021, and our Class A common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol SDIG.\u201d Refer to \"Note 27 - Initial Public Offering\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nStock Split\nWe effected 2.88-for-1 stock split on October 22, 2021, pursuant to which each share of common stock held of record by the holder thereof was reclassified into approximately 2.88 shares of common stock. No fractional shares were issued. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Stronghold LLC, as amended from time to time, each Stronghold LLC Unit was also split on a corresponding 2.88-for-1 basis, such that there are an equivalent number of Stronghold LLC Units outstanding as the aggregate number of shares of Class V common stock and Class A common stock outstanding following the stock split. We refer to this collectively as the Stock Split.\u201d\nBitmain\nOn October 28, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Bitmain Technologies Limited ( Bitmain\u201d) to purchase 12,000 miners, which will be delivered in six equal batches on a monthly basis beginning in April 2022 (the \"First Bitmain Purchase Agreement\"). Per the First Bitmain Purchase Agreement, on October 29, 2021, we made an initial payment of $23,300,000 to Bitmain for the miners, On November 18, 2021, we made an additional payment of $4,550,000. Subsequent payments will be made in the future in connection with additional deliveries of miners under the First Bitmain Purchase Agreement.\nOn November 16, 2021, we entered into a second agreement with Bitmain to purchase 1,800 miners, which will be delivered in six equal batches on a monthly basis beginning in July 2022 (the \"Second Bitmain Purchase Agreement\"). Per the Second Bitmain Purchase Agreement, on November 18, 2021, we made an initial payment of $6,835,000 to Bitmain for the miners. Subsequent payments will be made in the future in connection with additional deliveries of miners under the Second Bitmain Purchase Agreement.\nThe miners purchased pursuant to the two agreements with Bitmain will have an aggregate hash rate capacity of approximately 1,450 PH/s.\nNowlit Solutions Corp.\nWe paid for two separate purchases of miners from Nowlit Solutions Corp. The first purchase payment was made on November 23, 2021, in the amount of $1,605,360 for 190 miners. The second purchase payment was made on November 26, 2021, in the amount of $2,486,730 for an additional 295 miners.\nLuxor Technology Corporation\nWe paid for three separate purchases of miners from Luxor Technology Corporation (\"Luxor\"). The first purchase payment was made on November 26, 2021, in the amount of $4,312,650 for 770 miners. The second and third purchase payments were made on November 29, 2021, in the amount of $5,357,300 and $3,633,500 respectively, for an additional 750 and 500 miners.\nOn November 30, 2021, we entered into a fourth purchase agreement with Luxor to acquire 400 Antminer T19 miners with a hash rate of 84 TH/s and 400 Antminer T19 miners with a hash rate of 88 terahash per second (\"TH/s\") for a total purchase price of $6,260,800.\nCryptech Purchase Agreement\nOn December 7, 2021, we entered into a Hardware Purchase and Sales Agreement (the Cryptech Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Cryptech Solutions, Inc (\"Cryptech\") to acquire 1,000 Bitmain S19a miners (the Cryptech Miners\u201d) with a hash rate of 96 TH/s for a total purchase price of $8,592,000. Pursuant to the Cryptech Purchase Agreement, all hardware will be paid for in advance of being shipped to the Company.\nSupplier Purchase Agreements\nOn December 10, 2021, we entered into a Hardware Purchase and Sale Agreement (the First Supplier Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire 3,000 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S miners (the M30S Miners\u201d) with a hash rate per unit of 87 TH/s\u201d. Pursuant to the First Supplier Purchase Agreement, the unit price per M30S Miner is $6,960 for a cumulative purchase price of $20,880,000 that was paid in full within five business days of the execution of the First Supplier Purchase Agreement.\nOn December 16, 2021, we entered into a Second Hardware Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Second Supplier Purchase Agreement\") to acquire a cumulative amount of approximately 4,280 M30S Miners and MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S+ miners with a hash rate per unit of 100 TH/s (the M30S+ Miners\u201d). Pursuant to the Second Supplier Purchase Agreement, the unit price per M30S Miner is $2,714 and the unit price per M30S+ Miner is $3,520 for a cumulative purchase price of $11,340,373.\nNYDIG ABL LLC\nOn December 15, 2021, we entered into a Master Equipment Finance Agreement (the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement\u201d) with NYDIG ABL LLC ( NYDIG\u201d) whereby NYDIG agreed to lend Stronghold Digital Mining BT, LLC (\"Digital Mining BT\") up to $53,952,000 to finance the purchase of certain Bitcoin miners and related equipment (the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment\u201d). Outstanding borrowings under the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement are secured by the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment, contracts to acquire Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment, and the Bitcoin mined by the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment. The Second NYDIG Financing Agreement includes customary restrictions on additional liens on the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment. The NYDIG Second Financing Agreement may not be terminated by Digital Mining BT or prepaid in whole or in part. Refer to \"Note 6 - Long-Term Debt\" and \"Note 32 - Subsequent Events\" in our notes to our financial statements.\nO&M Agreement\nOn November 2, 2021, we entered into the Operations, Maintenance and Ancillary Services Agreement (the Omnibus Services Agreement\u201d) with Olympus Stronghold Services, LLC ( Olympus Stronghold Services\u201d), whereby Olympus Stronghold Services will provide certain operations and maintenance services to Stronghold LLC, as well as employ certain personnel to operate the Panther Creek Plant and the Scrubgrass Plant. Stronghold LLC will reimburse Olympus Stronghold Services for those costs incurred by Olympus Stronghold Services and approved by Stronghold LLC in the course of providing services under the Omnibus Services Agreement, including payroll and benefits costs and insurance costs. The material costs incurred by Olympus Stronghold Services shall be approved by Stronghold LLC. Stronghold LLC will also pay Olympus Stronghold Services a management fee at the rate of $1,000,000 per year, payable monthly, and an additional one-time mobilization fee of $150,000 upon the effective date of the Omnibus Services Agreement. Refer to \"Note 9 - Related Party Transactions\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nReorganization\nOn April 1, 2021, we effected the corporate reorganization described in \"Note 1 - Business Combinations\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nKey Performance Metrics\nWe rely on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), a non-GAAP (as defined below) key performance metric, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted by the removal of one-time transaction costs, periodic impairment of digital currencies, realized gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets, expenses related to stock-based compensation, gains or losses on derivative contracts, gain on extinguishment of debt, realized gain or loss on sale of digital currencies, waste coal credits, commission on sale of ash, or changes in fair value of warrant liabilities in the period presented.\nOur board of directors (the Board\u201d) and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation, amortization, impairment, and realized gains and losses on sale of long-term assets) and other items (such as one-time transaction costs, expenses related to stock-based compensation, and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts)\nthat impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing our financial performance and results of operations across reporting periods by excluding items we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be\ndetermined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, stock-based compensation and business combinations. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies we have adopted. In order to get a full understanding of our financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed.\nA summary of our critical accounting policies follows:\nFair Value Measurements\nWe measure at fair value certain of our financial and non-financial assets and liabilities by using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially an exit price, based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity's own assumptions.\nA financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nCryptocurrency Machines\nManagement has assessed the basis of depreciation of our cryptocurrency machines used to verify digital currency transactions and generate digital currencies and believes they should be depreciated over a two-year period. The rate at which we generate digital assets and, therefore, consume the economic benefits of our transaction verification servers, is influenced by a number of factors including the following:\n1.The complexity of the transaction verification process which is driven by the algorithms contained within the Bitcoin open source software;\n2.The general availability of appropriate computer processing capacity on a global basis (commonly referred to in the industry as hashing capacity which is measured in petahash units); and\n3.Technological obsolescence reflecting rapid development in the transaction verification server industry such that more recently developed hardware is more economically efficient to run in terms of digital assets generated as a function of operating costs, primarily power costs, (i.e., the speed of hardware evolution in the industry is such that later hardware models generally have faster processing capacity combined with lower operating costs and a lower cost of purchase).\nWe operate in an emerging industry for which limited data is available to make estimates of the useful economic lives of specialized equipment. Management has determined that two years best reflects the current expected useful life of transaction verification servers. This assessment takes into consideration the availability of historical data and management's expectations regarding the direction of the industry including potential changes in technology. Management will review this estimate annually and will revise such estimate as and when data becomes available.\nTo the extent that any of the assumptions underlying management's estimate of useful life of its transaction verification servers are subject to revision in a future reporting period either as a result of changes in circumstances or through the availability of greater quantities of data then the estimated useful life could change and have a prospective impact on depreciation expense and the carrying amounts of these assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of this revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\n1.Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer\n2.Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n3.Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n4.Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n5.Step 5: Recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation\nIn order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606's definition of a distinct\u201d good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct), and the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\nIf a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.\nWhen determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:\n\u2022Variable consideration\n\u2022Constraining estimates of variable consideration\n\u2022The existence of a significant financing component in the contract\n\u2022Noncash consideration\n\u2022Consideration payable to a customer\nVariable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate. There were no revenue streams with variable consideration during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThere is currently no specific definitive guidance under GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for cryptocurrencies recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), we may be required to change our policies, which could have an effect on our condensed consolidated financial position and results from operations.\nFair value of the digital asset award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt.\nOur policies with respect to our revenue streams are detailed below.\nEnergy Revenue\nWe operate as a market participant through PJM Interconnection, a Regional Transmission Organization ( RTO\u201d) that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity. We sell energy in the wholesale generation market in the PJM RTO. Energy revenues are delivered as a series of distinct units that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time and are therefore accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. The transaction price is based on pricing published in the day ahead market which constitute the stand-alone selling price.\nEnergy revenue is recognized over time as energy volumes are generated and delivered to the RTO (which is contemporaneous with generation), using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of the performance obligation. We apply the invoice practical expedient in recognizing energy revenue. Under the invoice practical expedient, energy revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is considered equal to the value provided to the customer for our performance obligation completed to date.\nReactive energy power is provided to maintain a continuous voltage level. Revenue from reactive power is recognized ratably over time as we stand ready to provide it if called upon by the PJM RTO.\nCapacity Revenue\nWe provide capacity to a customer through participation in capacity auctions held by the PJM RTO. Capacity revenues are a series of distinct performance obligations that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time and are therefore accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. The transaction price for capacity is market-based and constitutes the stand-alone selling price. As capacity represents our stand-ready obligation, capacity revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied ratably over time, on a monthly basis, since we stand ready equally throughout the period to deliver power to the PJM RTO if called upon. We apply the invoice practical expedient in recognizing capacity revenue. Under the invoice practical expedient, capacity revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is considered equal to the value provided to the customer for our performance obligation completed to date. Penalties may be assessed by the PJM RTO against generation facilities if the facility is not available during the capacity period. The penalties assessed by the PJM RTO, if any, are recorded as a reduction to capacity revenue when incurred.\nCryptocurrency Hosting\nWe have entered into customer hosting contracts whereby we provide electrical power to cryptocurrency mining customers, and the customers pay a stated amount per MWh ( Contract Capacity\u201d). This amount is paid monthly in advance. Amounts used in excess of the Contract Capacity are billed based upon calculated formulas as contained in the contracts. If any shortfalls occur due to outages, make-whole payment provisions contained in the contracts are used to offset the billings to the customer which prevented them from cryptocurrency mining. Advanced payments and customer deposits are reflected as contract liabilities.\nCryptocurrency Mining\nWe have entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts, as amended from time to time, with the mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and our enforceable right to compensation only begins when we provide computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, we are entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are recorded as a component of cost of revenues), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain. The terms of the agreement provide that neither party can dispute settlement terms after thirty-five days following settlement. Our fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power we contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.\nProviding computing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of our ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in our contracts with mining pool operators. The transaction consideration we receive, if any, is noncash consideration, which we measure at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time we have earned the award from the pools. The consideration is all variable. Because it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur, the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and we receive confirmation of the consideration we will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.\nFair value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt. There is currently no specific definitive guidance under GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for cryptocurrencies recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the FASB, we may be required to change our policies, which could have an effect on our consolidated financial position and results from operations.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAsset retirement obligations, including those conditioned on future events, are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset in the same period. In each subsequent period, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the EUL of the long-lived asset. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, we recognize a gain or loss on settlement. Our asset retirement obligation represents the cost we would incur to perform environmental clean-up or dismantle certain portions of the Facility.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset (group) that is held and used must be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (group) might not be recoverable (i.e., information indicates that an impairment might exist). We are responsible for routinely assessing whether impairment indicators are present and should have systems or processes to assist in the identification of potential impairment indicators.\nWe are not required to perform an impairment analysis (i.e., test the asset (group) for recoverability and potentially measure an impairment loss) if indicators of impairment are not present. We have assessed the need for an impairment write-down only if an indicator of impairment (e.g., a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset (group)) is present. Based on our analysis, no impairment indicators existed as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, that would require impairment testing of our long-lived assets.\nDerivative Contracts\nIn accordance with guidance on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities all derivatives should be recognized at fair value. Derivatives or any portion thereof, that are not designated as, and effective as, hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. Derivative contracts are classified as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying combined balance sheets. Certain contracts that require physical delivery may qualify for and be designated as normal purchases/normal sales. Such contracts are accounted for on an accrual basis.\nWe use derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to various energy commodity market risks. We do not enter into any derivative contracts or similar arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We will, at times, sell our forward unhedged electricity capacity to stabilize its future operating margins.\nWe also use derivative instruments to mitigate the risks of bitcoin market pricing volatility. We entered into a variable prepaid forward sale contract that mitigates bitcoin market pricing volatility risks between a low and high collar of bitcoin market prices during the contract term. This contract settles in September 2022. The contract meets the definition of a derivative transaction pursuant to guidance under ASC 815 and is considered a compound derivative instrument which is required to be presented at fair value subject to remeasurement each reporting period. The changes in fair value is recorded as changes in fair value of forward sale derivative as part of earnings.\nStock Based Compensation\nFor equity-classified awards, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period based on the computed fair value on the grant date of the award. Equity classified awards include the issuance of stock options and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d).\nNotes Payable\nWe record notes payable net of any discounts or premiums. Discounts and premiums are amortized as interest expense or income over the life of the note in such a way as to result in a constant rate of interest when applied to the amount outstanding at the beginning of any given period.\nWarrant Liabilities\nWe record warrant liabilities at their fair value as of the balance sheet date, and recognizes changes in the balances, over the comparative periods of either the issuance date or the last reporting date, as part of changes in fair value of warrant liabilities expense. At the issuance date, each series of warrants were convertible and redeemable to preferred stock.\nLoss per share\nBasic net (loss) income per share ( EPS\u201d) of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding or shares subject to exercise for a nominal value during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity.\nIncome Taxes\nThe amount of income taxes we record requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, and local tax jurisdictions. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized after considering all positive and negative evidence available concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets.\nAs of the year ended December 31, 2021, we maintained a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance remains in place based on the uncertainty of future events, including the Company's ability to generate future taxable income in light of its recent losses, and management considered this and other factors in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Any changes in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if our deferred tax assets will be realized could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management. These assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change. Material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the potential for income tax audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters.\nPost IPO Taxation and Public Company Costs\nStronghold LLC is and has been organized as a pass through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is therefore not subject to entity-level U.S. federal income taxes. Stronghold Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on March 19, 2021 and therefore is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and state and local taxes at the prevailing corporate income tax rates, including with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of Stronghold LLC. In addition to tax expenses, Stronghold Inc. also incurs expenses related to its operations, plus payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement entered into between the Company, Q Power LLC ( Q Power\u201d) and an agent named by Q Power, dated April 1, 2021 (the TRA\u201d), which are expected to be significant. To the extent Stronghold LLC has available cash and subject to the terms of any current or future debt instruments, the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Stronghold LLC, as amended from time to time (the Stronghold LLC Agreement\u201d) requires Stronghold LLC to make pro rata cash distributions to holders of Stronghold LLC Units ( Stronghold Unit Holders\u201d), including Stronghold Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow Stronghold Inc. to pay its taxes and to make payments under the TRA. In addition, the Stronghold LLC Agreement requires Stronghold LLC to make non-pro rata payments to Stronghold Inc. to reimburse it for its corporate and other overhead expenses, which payments are not treated as distributions under the Stronghold LLC Agreement. See -Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d herein for additional information.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, incremental, non-recurring costs related to our transition to a publicly traded corporation, including the costs of the IPO and the costs associated with the initial implementation of our internal control reviews and testing pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"). We have also incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional significant and recurring expenses as a publicly traded corporation, including costs associated with compliance under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, annual and quarterly reports to common stockholders, registrar and transfer agent fees, national stock exchange fees, audit fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and director and officer compensation. Our financial statements following the IPO will continue to reflect the impact of these expenses.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Our Future Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations\nOur historical financial results discussed below may not be comparable to our future financial results for the reasons described below.\nStronghold Inc. is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes as a corporation. Our accounting predecessor was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as such, was generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level. Rather, the tax liability with respect to its taxable income was passed through to its members. Accordingly, the financial data attributable to our predecessor contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality. Due to cumulative and current losses as well as an evaluation of other sources of income as outlined in ASC 740, management has determined that the utilization of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, and therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Management continues to evaluate the likelihood of the Company utilizing its deferred taxes, and while the valuation allowance remains in place, we expect to record no deferred income tax expense or benefit. Should the valuation allowance no longer be required, the 21% statutory federal income tax rate as well as state and local income taxes at their respective rates will apply to income allocated to Stronghold Inc., resulting in an estimated blended statutory rate of 28.89% of pre-tax earnings or losses attributable to the Company.\nAs we further implement controls, processes and infrastructure applicable to companies with publicly traded equity securities, it is likely that we will incur additional selling, general and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses relative to historical periods. Our future results will depend on our ability to efficiently manage our combined operations and execute our business strategy.\nAs we continue to acquire miners and utilize our power generating assets to power such miners, we anticipate that a great proportion of our revenue and expenses will relate to crypto asset mining.\nAs previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, stock-based compensation and business combinations. The Company's financial position, results of operations and\ncash flows are impacted by the accounting policies the Company has adopted. In order to get a full understanding of the Company's financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed.\nConsolidated Results- for the twelve months ended

months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 include the effect of the Panther Creek Acquisition (refer to Note 25 - Acquisitions\" in notes to our financial statements) that closed on November 2, 2021. The Panther Creek Plant operates as part of our Energy Segment.\nIncluding $3.8 million from the Panther Creek Plant, total revenue from all segments increased by $26.8 million, or 650.7%, to approximately $30.9 million primarily driven by large increases in both the energy and crypto asset mining revenues. Energy generation and the continued ramp up to full MW capacity contributed to approximately $11.4 million or 2189.9%. Additionally, total crypto asset revenue growth of approximately $14.2 million included approximately $2.0\nmillion from hosting and an increase of $12.2 million from mining. The growth in the crypto asset mining revenue is the result of the significant ramp up of miner and transformer installations during the second half of 2021.\nIncluding $5.8 million from the Panther Creek Plant, total operating expenses increased by $46.6 million or 714.2%; The increase in total operating expenses was partially attributable to increases of $12.8 million in fuel for the Scrubgrass Plant to produce higher MW capacity to provide power to the energy operations and cryptocurrency operations segments. The Scrubgrass Plant was relatively dormant for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, we experienced an increase of $12.2 million in operations and maintenance expenses related to the energy ramp-up requiring labor, vehicles, and major upgrades so the Scrubgrass Plant can be fully operational at the required higher capacities. Further, we had an increase of $12.7 million in general and administrative expenses due to legal and professional fees, consulting fees, stock compensation expenses, increased insurance costs, and compensation as we continue to organize and scale to a larger legal structure. Impairment costs of $1.9 million were attributed to the declines in the Bitcoin market pricing, primarily during the August 2021 to December 2021 timeframes. We also recorded $7.6 million in depreciation, an increase of approximately $7.0 million over the comparable period in 2020, due to the ramp-up of capital expenditures required for miners and transformers to grow the cryptocurrency hosting and mining infrastructures that produce increased hash rates.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, other income (expense) amounted to $(5.1) million of expense compared to $2.3 million of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense increased in 2021 to $4.6 million compared to $205.5 thousand in December 31, 2020. The increase in interest expense was driven by $(1.1) million from changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, and $(116.5) thousand from changes in fair value of forward sale derivatives. We did not have outstanding warrants for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as the equity offerings occurred as part of the reorganization on April 1, 2021, and the subsequent private placement funding. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we significantly improved our liquidity and capability to expand our power and mining assets through borrowings and master equipment financing agreements. As a result, the $(4.4) million increase in interest expenses, from this required financing, was realized so we could purchase miners and transformers to support the acceleration of the crypto asset ramp ups. Negative impacts of these increases are partially offset by the gains from the extinguishment of the $638.8 thousand PPP loan in January 2021. The prior comparable period, the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, benefited from the $1.2 million gains from closing out all derivatives (i.e. hedging positions), and $1.1 million in waste coal credits discussed above.\nSegment Results\nThe below presents summarized results for our operations for the two reporting segments: Energy Operations and Cryptocurrency Operations.\nTable 19:

The increase was the result of the plant energy production no longer remaining relatively dormant as was the case during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Full plant power utilization is optimal for our revenue growth as it also drives a higher volume of Tier II Renewable Energy Credits (\"RECs\"), waste coal tax credits, and beneficial use ash sales, as well as the increased power bandwidths for the crypto asset operations.\nCapacity\nIncluding $681.7 thousand from the Panther Creek Plant, revenue generated from capacity increased by $1.4 million, or 50.5%, to approximately $4.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $2.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of the successful ramp up of MW capacity in 2021; coupled with higher pricing per kilowatt hour (\"kWh\") on the higher capacity usages.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased by $27.1 million, or 453.4%, to approximately $33.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $6.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nFuel - net of crypto segment subsidy\nIncluding $2.6 million from Panther Creek, fuel expense, after $(2.5) million in subsidized power costs from the crypto operations segment, increased by $10.4 million, or 3,278.4%, to approximately $10.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $316.0 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The subsidized power costs are for providing power to the crypto hosting and mining assets at a market price of $0.027 per kWh. The $10.4 million increase in fuel expenses compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to the continued expansions of energy production and the required coal, ash and limestone fuel purchases to generate energy to support the expansions. The fuel purchases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were very minimal as the Scrubgrass Plant was just starting to ramp up capacity, and both the crypto hosting and mining assets were relatively non-existent and did not purchase power from the Scrubgrass Plant.\nOperations and maintenance\nIncluding $1.7 million from the Panther Creek Plant, operations and maintenance expenses increased by $11.1 million, or 336.8%, to approximately $14.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $3.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increases result from the required costs to properly support and maintain the Scrubgrass Plant versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. These costs include payroll, plant-related treatment, major maintenance and upgrade expenditures to get the Scrubgrass Plant to full capacity, and vehicles. Including approximately $1.8 million in major repairs and upgrades that were considered out of the ordinary. The relative amount of these costs, particularly payroll and major maintenance and upgrade expenditures, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, were comparatively small as the Scrubgrass Plant was just beginning to increase MW production after being dormant.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include legal and professional fees, consulting costs, executive and support payroll, stock compensation expense, property taxes, insurance premiums related to coverages and rates, and management fees. The majority of general and administrative costs are allocated between the two segments using a fair-share\u201d of revenues approach, where the revenue for the segment is divided by the total combined revenues of the segments and is then multiplied by the shared general and administrative costs for the combined segments. Panther Creek G&A was $115.4 thousand.\nAs a result, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.9 million, or 270.8%, to approximately $6.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $1.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The cryptocurrency operations segment revenue was minimal for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, so the energy operations segment realized large portion of the general and administrative costs during this time. The majority of the $4.9 million increase was due to legal and professional fees, consulting startup costs, stock compensation expenses, as well as the execution of additional contracts to scale our legal structures and borrowing capabilities during this period. In addition, the payment of delinquent property taxes and the increases in insurance coverages and rates due to the purchase of a director and officer liability insurance policy, higher asset exposures, as well as higher rates in the risk markets contributed to the increase.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe majority of the depreciation and amortization expense that marginally increased by $746.8 thousand, or 133.7%, to approximately $1.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, from $558.6 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was due to $732.1 thousand from Panther Creek.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by $124.6 thousand, or (60.6)%, to $(80.9) thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $(205.5) thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as loans were either paid off or later in their terms with lower interest portions of their payments. Panther Creek had marginal impacts to Interest Expense.\nCryptocurrency Operations Segment\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change vs. 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING REVENUES </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crypto asset hosting </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,297,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,045,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>810.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crypto asset mining </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,494,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>339,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,155,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,580.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,792,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>591,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,200,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,399.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING EXPENSES </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel -

This increase was due to the continued expansion of generated power sales to crypto asset mining customers for which we are providing hosting services.\nCrypto asset mining revenue\nRevenue generated from crypto asset mining increased by $12.2 million, or 3,580.8%, to approximately $12.49 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $339.5 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of the significant purchases of miners and transformers, with the expansions that started during the fourth quarter of 2020 through the end of 2021. The deployments of these miners and transformers are significantly increasing total hash rates and Bitcoin awards.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased to $19.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $542.9 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There were minimal hosting customers and a very insignificant hash rate output due to a small number of miners for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, resulting in very small costs to operate. Of the $19.7 million in operating expenses, approximately 32.0% are attributed to depreciation and amortization relative to the ramping up of our cryptocurrency miner assets that have two year useful lives; whereas 40.4% of the $19.7 million operating expenses are general and administrative expenses that includes stock compensation expenses, and startup costs related to legal and consulting.\nFuel - purchased from energy segment\nThe cryptocurrency operations segment purchases power from the Scrubgrass Plant at $0.027 per kWh to provide power to both the hosted customer and Bitcoin mining equipment. The $2.4 million increase compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to the continued expansions of these assets and customer strategy, as discussed previously, starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 with significant ramp up starting in the second half of 2021.\nOperations and maintenance\nOperations and maintenance expenses increased by $1.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from zero for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase includes technicians now required to support multiple data centers and maintenance, as well as repairs and operating parts to maintain a larger base of miners.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include legal and professional fees, consulting fees, stock compensation expenses, executive and support payroll, property taxes, insurance premiums related to coverages and rates, and management fees. The majority of general and administrative costs are allocated between the two segments using a fair-share\u201d of revenues approach, where the revenue for the segment is divided by the total combined revenues of the segments and is then multiplied by the shared general and administrative costs for the combined segments.\nAs a result, general and administrative expenses were $8.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to $469.2 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The percentage of crypto asset segment revenues to the total segment revenues is increasing; thus a higher relative allocation of these shared costs. The majority of the $8.0 million was due to legal and professional fees, consulting startup costs, stock compensation expenses, as well as the execution of additional contracts to scale our legal structures and borrowing capabilities during this period. In addition, the payment of delinquent property taxes and the increases in insurance coverages and rates due to the purchase of a director and officer liability insurance policy, higher asset exposures, as well as higher rates in the risk markets.\nImpairments on digital currencies\nThe crypto spot market is volatile and can have a negative impact on the mark-to-market of our digital currencies as of the ending balance sheet reporting date. As a result, a $1.9 million impairment charge was recognized as a result of the negative impacts from the crypto coin spot market declines against the held crypto coin inventories not yet converted to cash. As of December 31, 2021, the Company held on its balance sheet approximately 182 Bitcoin and the spot market price of Bitcoin was $47,686.81 per Coinbase Global Inc.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense of $6.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from zero for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase is the result of the continued purchase of infrastructure assets and miners for the crypto asset operations driving a higher depreciable base for 2021. This ramp up has significantly accelerated starting in the second half of 2021.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $(4.5) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from zero for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and was attributed to the required increased financing to purchase and ramp up both the miners and transformers operating bases. We have executed on a large number of hardware purchase and master equipment financing agreements that has provided both liquidity and the capability to scale the transformer and miner installation bases that generate our cryptocurrency mining revenues.\nComparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted by the removal of one-time transaction costs, periodic impairment of digital currencies, realized gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets, expenses related to stock-based compensation, gains or losses on derivative contracts, gain on extinguishment of debt, realized gain or loss on sale of digital currencies, waste coal credits, commission on sale of ash, or changes in fair value of warrant liabilities in the period presented.\nOur Board and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation, amortization, impairment, and realized gains and losses on sale of long-term assets) and other items (such as one-time transaction costs, expenses related to stock-based compensation, and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing our financial performance and results of operations across reporting periods by excluding items we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,255.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(145.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest </td> <td> </td> <td>4,622.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>7,607.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>558.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment costs of digital currencies </td> <td> </td> <td>1,870.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One time non-recurring expenses 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>7,070.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses related to stock-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>4,015.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gains)/Losses on derivative contracts </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,207.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Waste coal credits </td> <td> </td> <td>(47.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,188.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on extinguishment of PPP loan </td> <td> </td> <td>(638.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized (gain)/loss on sale of digital currencies </td> <td> </td> <td>(149.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value of forward sale derivative\u2026................. </td> <td> </td> <td>116.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value of warrant liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>1,143.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,645.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,811.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Includes the following non-recurring expenses: legal fees related to the Panther Creek Acquisition and the Northern Data Hosting Agreement, bad debt write-offs, startup costs related to initial crypto asset stores inventories, out-of-the-ordinary major repairs and upgrades to the power plant, and other one-time items.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nStronghold Inc. is a holding company with no operations and is the sole managing member of Stronghold LLC. Our principal asset consists of units of Stronghold LLC. Our earnings and cash flows and ability to meet any debt obligations will depend on the cash flows resulting from the operations of our operating subsidiaries, and the payment of distributions to us by such subsidiaries.\nOur cash needs are primarily for growth through acquisitions and working capital to support equipment financing and the purchase of additional miners. We have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses in servicing and maintaining our power generation facilities. If we were to acquire additional facilities in the future, capital expenditures may include improvements, maintenance, and buildout costs associated with enabling such facilities to house miners to mine Bitcoin.\nWe have historically relied on funds from equity issuances, equipment financings, and revenue from sales of Bitcoin and power generated at our power plants to provide for our liquidity needs. During 2021, we received $63.2 million (net of loan fees and debt issuance costs) in proceeds from the financing agreements with WhiteHawk and NYDIG, net proceeds of $131.5 million from the IPO and net proceeds of $96.8 million from two private placements of convertible preferred securities. Additionally, on March 28, 2022, we received an additional $25.0 million from WhiteHawk as a result of the Second WhiteHawk Amendment. Please see -Debt Agreements - Equipment Purchase and Financing Transactions\u201d for more information regarding our financing arrangements. These cash sources provided additional short and long-term liquidity to support our operations in fiscal year 2021 and through the first quarter of 2022. Taking into account the Second WhiteHawk Amendment and other sources of capital, such as proceeds from asset sales or additional sources of debt or equity financing, to which we believe we have access, we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next twelve months. We anticipate also that we will need additional sources of capital and will need to increase our cash flow from operations and financing activities for our long-term capital needs including to fund our business plan and to meet our long-term operating requirements. We may sell assets or seek potential additional debt or equity financing to fund our short-term and long-term needs. If we are unable to ramp up our Bitcoin mining efforts and raise additional capital, there is a risk that we could default on our obligations and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of our operations, including through the sale of our assets, if no other means of financing options are available. As of December 31, 2021 and March 24, 2022, we had 182 and 344 Bitcoins on hand, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and March 28, 2022, we had approximately $39.5 million and approximately $32 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and March 28, 2022, we had outstanding indebtedness of $68.5 million and $117.8 million, respectively, and availability under our financing agreements of $35.4 million and $18.0 million, respectively.\nWe have not yet established a consistent, ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs, and we incurred a net loss of $27.3 million in fiscal 2021 and an accumulated deficit of $338.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The losses incurred in recent years, with the associated substantial accumulated deficit, are a result of our Bitcoin mining ramp-up, which is a capital intensive industry. We experienced a number of setbacks and unexpected challenges, including a longer-than-expected delay of the MinerVa miners and longer than expected downtime at our Scrubgrass Plant for maintenance. As a result of the delay in delivery of the MinerVa miners, we were at risk of defaulting on our obligations under the WhiteHawk debt facility because those miners were to be provided as collateral to WhiteHawk by April 30, 2022. We spent approximately $5.1 million in fiscal year 2021 on maintenance and repair costs at the Scrubgrass Plant, and we estimate that we will spend an aggregate of $30 million on total repair and maintenance cost in fiscal 2022. In addition to incurred expenses, we are also unable to mine Bitcoin at the Scrubgrass Plant during such downtime, which directly and negatively affects our results of operations. Due to these and the other operational setbacks discussed herein, we estimate that such factors have negatively impacted our cash on hand by approximately $40 million to $45 million as of March 24, 2022 compared to if miners had been delivered in accordance with the original delivery schedules under purchase agreements and the Scrubgrass Plant's uptime was as expected. As a result of these events, we faced a significant liquidity shortfall that reduced our cash position to approximately $3 million on March 28, 2022, with available funding of another $18 million. In response, we sought and obtained the Second WhiteHawk Amendment to substitute collateral, avoid an event of default, and obtain additional funding to address our near-term liquidity needs. We believe our liquidity position, combined with expected operating cash flow and the proceeds of additional debt or equity financings or asset sales, will be sufficient to meet our existing commitments and fund our operations for the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes Between the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,664.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>587.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,252.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(257,018.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,827.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(255,190.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>294,170.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,409.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>292,760.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,486.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>169.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,317.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $(5.7) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $587.2 thousand of net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The $(5.7) million increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to increases in operations and G&A costs due to the expansions in energy production and the crypto asset mining operations, and significant increases in investments by holding digital currencies versus converting to cash equivalents in the spot markets. Those changes were partially offset by managing positive cash float with our trade payable vendors. The energy production was relatively dormant for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and crypto asset mining operations ramped up significantly starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 The end result of the dormant energy production, in 2020, did not require the relatively higher net operating cash outflows as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $(257.0) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $(1.8) million used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The $(257.0) million net cash used in investing activities was attributable to the continued ramp up of the crypto asset segment. These investments require significant deposits by equipment vendors as commitments for future deliveries of miners, increasing the production bandwidths by building out our power and container infrastructures, and the implementation of any additional miners starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 into the full year ending 2021. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $490.0 thousand in acquired Panther Creek cash. The $(1.8) million in net cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December, 2020 includes $(2.0) million in construction in progress and miner acquisition costs due to the start of developing the power and mining infrastructure for future cryptocurrency miners.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $294.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.4 million provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The significant increase of $292.8 million in cash provided by financing activities was a culmination of receiving $131.5 million in proceeds from the initial public offering (net of transaction fees) and $96.8 million (net of transaction fees) from our private placement equity raises of Series A Stock and Series B Stock. In addition, proceeds from the WhiteHawk Promissory Note of $39.1 million (net of debt issuance costs), as discussed in Note 14 - Stocks Issued Under Master Financing Agreements and Warrants,\" in the notes to our financial statements, $24.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) drawn against the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement (as defined below), discussed in \"Note 14 - Stocks Issued Under Master Financing Agreements and Warrants\" in the notes our financial statements; $17.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) received in advances from the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement as discussed in Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies\", the $7.0 million prepayment from the variable forward asset sales contract . This was partially offset by a $(2.0) million payoff of two related-party notes, $(2.0) million cash portion of the $(7.0) million buyout of the Aspen Interest, and (16.3) million in debt payments that are substantially related to the loans previously mentioned, and -$2.6 million paid on the financed insurance premium as discussed in Note 29 - Commercial Premium Financing Agreement. We received a second round PPP loan in March 2021 in the amount of $841.7 thousand. The first PPP loan received in May 2020 for $638.8 thousand was forgiven in January 2021. We are in the process of seeking forgiveness of our second PPP loan of $841.7 thousand. Additionally, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan received in June 2020 in the amount of $150.0 thousand was paid off on June 7, 2021.\nDebt Agreements\nWe have entered into various debt agreements used to purchase equipment to operate our business.\nWe entered into the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement on June 30, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the amount owed under the debt agreements totaled $40.7 million with repayment terms extending through June 30, 2023.

The agreement requires a $1.4 million down payment, with the remaining $5.5 million plus interest paid over nine months. Monthly payments of $621.3 thousand started November 21, 2021 and end July 21, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the unpaid balance is $4.3 million.\nEquipment Purchase and Financing Transactions\nMinerVa Semiconductor Corp Purchase Agreement\nOn April 2, 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement with MinerVa for the acquisition of 15,000 of their MV7 ASIC SHA256 model cryptocurrency miner equipment (miners) with a total terahash to be delivered equal to 1.5 million terahash. The price per miner is $4,892.50 for an aggregate purchase price of $73,387,500 to be paid in installments. The first installment of 60% of the purchase price, or $44,032,500, was paid on April 2, 2021, and an additional payment of 20% of the purchase price, or $14,677,500, was paid on June 2, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, there are no remaining deposits owed. In December 2021, we extended the deadline for delivery of the MinerVa miners to April 2022. In March 2022, MinerVa was again unable to meet its delivery date and has only delivered approximately 3,200 of the 15,000 miners. We do not know when the remaining MinerVa miners will be received, if at all. As a result, we may write off some or all of the approximately 11,700 undelivered MinerVa miners. MinerVa continues to tell us that MinerVa anticipates shipping no less than 15,000 miners by April 2022. Refer to Note 30 - Covenants that describe covenants referencing the anticipated final delivery timeframe of April 2022. Please see \"Note 32 - Subsequent Events\" in the notes to our financial statements for further disclosure on payment of the remaining 20%. In exchange for the delivery of the miners that are operating under the specifications set forth in the purchase agreement, we will grant the seller 443,848 shares of our Class A common stock at a price per share of $8.68 (adjusted for the Stock Split). The aggregate purchase price does not include shipping costs, which are our responsibility and shall be determined at which time the miners are ready for shipment.\nNowlit Solutions Corp Purchase Agreement\nWe entered into a hardware purchase and sales agreement with Nowlit Solutions Corp effective April 1, 2021.

The Second NYDIG Financing Agreement may not be terminated by us or prepaid in whole or in part.\nWhiteHawk Financing Agreement\nOn June 30, 2021, we entered into an equipment financing agreement (the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement\u201d) with WhiteHawk Finance LLC (\"Whitehawk\") whereby WhiteHawk agreed to lend to us an aggregate amount not to exceed $40.0 million (the Total Advance\u201d) to finance the purchase of certain Bitcoin miners and related equipment (the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment\u201d). At August 30, 2021, the entirety of the Total Advance was drawn under the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement. The aggregate principal outstanding bears interest of 10% and will be repaid in 24 monthly payments. Outstanding borrowings under the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement are secured by the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment and the contracts to acquire the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment. The WhiteHawk Financing Agreement includes customary restrictions on additional liens on the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment and is guaranteed by the Company. The WhiteHawk Financing Agreement may be terminated early if we, among other things, pay the Early Termination Fee (as defined therein). In conjunction with the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement, we issued a stock purchase warrant to WhiteHawk, which provides for the purchase of a number of shares of Class A common stock at $0.01 per share, equal to approximately $2.0 million, subject to adjustment as described in the warrant agreement (the WhiteHawk Warrant\u201d). The WhiteHawk Warrant expires on June 30, 2031.\nOn December 31, 2021, we amended the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement (the WhiteHawk Amendment\u201d) to extend the final MinerVa delivery date from December 31, 2021 to April 30, 2022. Pursuant to the WhiteHawk Amendment, Equipment, LLC paid an amendment fee in the amount of $250,000 to WhiteHawk. On March 28, 2022, Equipment LLC and WhiteHawk again amended the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement (the \"Second WhiteHawk Amendment\") to\nexchange the collateral under the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement. Pursuant to the Second WhiteHawk Amendment, (i) the approximately 11,700 remaining miners under the MinerVa Purchase Agreement will be exchanged as collateral for additional miners received by us from other suppliers and (ii) WhiteHawk agreed to lend to us an additional amount not exceed $25.0 million to finance certain previously purchased Bitcoin miners and related equipment (the \"Second Total Advance\"). Pursuant to the Second WhiteHawk Amendment, Equipment, LLC paid an amendment fee in the amount of $275,414.40 and a closing fee with respect to the Second Total Advance of $500,000. In addition to the purchased Bitcoin miners and related equipment, Panther Creek and Scrubgrass each agreed to a negative pledge of the Panther Creek Plant and Scrubgrass Plant, respectively, and guaranteed the WhiteHawk Finance Agreement. Each of the negative pledge and the guaranty by Panther Creek and Scrubgrass will be released upon payment in full of the Second Total Advance, regardless of whether the Total Advance remains outstanding. In conjunction with the Second WhiteHawk Amendment, we issued a warrant to WhiteHawk to purchase 125,000 shares of Class A common stock, subject to certain antidilution and other adjustment provisions as described in the warrant agreement, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the Second WhiteHawk Warrant\u201d). The Second WhiteHawk Warrant expires on March 28, 2032. While we continue to engage in discussions with MinerVa on the delivery of the remaining miners, we do not know when the remaining miners will be delivered, if at all.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nThe TRA generally provides for the payment by Stronghold Inc. to certain of the Stronghold Unit Holders of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax (computed using the estimated impact of state and local taxes) that Stronghold Inc. actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) certain increases in tax basis that occur as a result of Stronghold Inc.'s acquisition (or deemed acquisition for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of all or a portion of such holder's Stronghold LLC Units pursuant to an exercise of Redemption Right or the Call Right and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by Stronghold Inc. as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments Stronghold Inc. makes under the TRA. Stronghold Inc. will retain the remaining net cash savings, if any. The TRA generally provides for payments to be made as Stronghold Inc. realizes actual cash tax savings from the tax benefits covered by the TRA. However, the TRA provides that if Stronghold Inc. elects to terminate the TRA early (or it is terminated early due to Stronghold Inc.'s failure to honor a material obligation thereunder or due to certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control), Stronghold Inc. is required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the future payments it would be required to make if it realized deemed tax savings pursuant to the TRA (determined by applying a discount rate equal to one-year LIBOR (or an agreed successor rate, if applicable) plus 100 basis points, and using numerous assumptions to determine deemed tax savings), and such early termination payment is expected to be substantial and may exceed the future tax benefits realized by Stronghold Inc.\nThe actual timing and amount of any payments that may be made under the TRA are unknown at this time and will vary based on a number of factors. However, Stronghold Inc. expects that the payments that it will be required to make to Q Power (or its permitted assignees) in connection with the TRA will be substantial. Any payments made by Stronghold Inc. to Q Power (or its permitted assignees) under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of cash that might have otherwise been available to Stronghold Inc. or Stronghold LLC. To the extent Stronghold LLC has available cash and subject to the terms of any current or future debt or other agreements, the Stronghold LLC Agreement will require Stronghold LLC to make pro rata cash distributions to holders of Stronghold LLC Units, including Stronghold Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow Stronghold Inc. to pay its taxes and to make payments under the TRA. Stronghold Inc. generally expects Stronghold LLC to fund such distributions out of available cash. However, except in cases where Stronghold Inc. elects to terminate the TRA early, the TRA is terminated early due to certain mergers or other changes of control or Stronghold Inc. has available cash but fails to make payments when due, generally Stronghold Inc. may defer payments due under the TRA if it does not have available cash to satisfy its payment obligations under the TRA or if its contractual obligations limit its ability to make these payments. Any such deferred payments under the TRA generally will accrue interest at the rate provided for in the TRA, and such interest may significantly exceed Stronghold Inc.'s other costs of capital. If Stronghold Inc. experiences a change of control (as defined under the TRA, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations), and in certain other circumstances, payments under the TRA may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, Stronghold Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA. In the case of such an acceleration in connection with a change of control, where applicable, Stronghold Inc. generally expects the accelerated payments due under the TRA to be funded out of the proceeds of the change of control transaction giving rise to such acceleration, which could have a significant impact on our ability to\nconsummate a change of control or reduce the proceeds received by our stockholders in connection with a change of control. However, Stronghold Inc. may be required to fund such payment from other sources, and as a result, any early termination of the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity or financial condition.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAs an emerging growth company\u201d ( EGC\u201d), the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ( JOBS Act\u201d) allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. The adoption dates discussed below reflect this election.\nAs of January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted Topic 606 under the modified retrospective approach whereby the cumulative effect of adopting the new guidance was recognized on the date of initial application. The adoption of ASC 606 did not result in a change to the accounting for revenue, as such, no cumulative effect adjustment was recorded.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( Topic 842\u201d), which supersedes ASC Topic 840, Leases. Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. Topic 842 will be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. In November 2020, FASB deferred the effective date for implementation of Topic 842 by one year and, in June 2020, FASB deferred the effective date by an additional year. Beginning after December 15, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, the guidance under Topic 842 is effective. We are still in the process of developing our new accounting policies and determining the potential aggregate impact this guidance is likely to have on our financial statements as of its adoption date.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no material off balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_truncated": "\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy Operations\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(80,866) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(205,480) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cryptocurrency Operations </td> <td>(4,541,789) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,541,789) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Interest Expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,622,655) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(205,480) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,417,175) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,149.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Expenses\nRevenue generated from crypto asset hosting increased by $2.0 million to $2.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.

Stronghold Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on March 19, 2021 and therefore is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and state and local taxes at the prevailing corporate income tax rates, including with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of Stronghold LLC. In addition to tax expenses, Stronghold Inc. also incurs expenses related to its operations, plus payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement entered into between the Company, Q Power LLC ( Q Power\u201d) and an agent named by Q Power, dated April 1, 2021 (the TRA\u201d), which are expected to be significant.

Amount is shown as a reconciling item between net operating income/(losses) and consolidated income before taxes. Refer to our consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 for further details.\nStronghold Inc. is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes as a corporation. Our accounting predecessor was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as such, was generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level. Rather, the tax liability with respect to its taxable income was passed through to its members. Accordingly, the financial data attributable to our predecessor contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality. Due to cumulative and current losses as well as an evaluation of other sources of income as outlined in ASC 740, management has determined that the utilization of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, and therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Management continues to evaluate the likelihood of the Company utilizing its deferred taxes, and while the valuation allowance remains in place, we expect to record no deferred income tax expense or benefit. Should the valuation allowance no longer be required, the 21% statutory federal income tax rate as well as state and local income taxes at their respective rates will apply to income allocated to Stronghold Inc., resulting in an estimated blended statutory rate of 28.89% of pre-tax earnings or losses attributable to the Company.\nDepreciation and amortization expense of $6.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from zero for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase is the result of the continued purchase of infrastructure assets and miners for the crypto asset operations driving a higher depreciable base for 2021. This ramp up has significantly accelerated starting in the second half of 2021.\nOperating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $(5.7) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $587.2 thousand of net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The $(5.7) million increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to increases in operations and G&A costs due to the expansions in energy production and the crypto asset mining operations, and significant increases in investments by holding digital currencies versus converting to cash equivalents in the spot markets. Those changes were partially offset by managing positive cash float with our trade payable vendors. The energy production was relatively dormant for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and crypto asset mining operations ramped up significantly starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 The end result of the dormant energy production, in 2020, did not require the relatively higher net operating cash outflows as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change vs. 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING REVENUES </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,870,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>518,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,352,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2189.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capacity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,238,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,816,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,422,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>191,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(178,332) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,123,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,526,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,596,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING EXPENSES </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel -

We wholly own and operate two low-cost, environmentally-beneficial coal refuse power generation facilities that we have upgraded: (i) our first reclamation facility located on a 650-acre site in Scrubgrass Township, Venango County, Pennsylvania, which we acquired the remaining interest of in April 2021 and currently has the capacity to generate approximately 83.5 megawatts (\"MW\") of electricity (the \"Scrubgrass Plant\") and (ii) a facility located near Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania, which we acquired in November of 2021 and which has the capacity to generate approximately 80 MW of electricity (the \"Panther Creek Plant\"), each of which are recognized as an Alternative Energy System because coal refuse is classified under Pennsylvania law as a Tier II Alternative Energy Source (large-scale hydropower is also classified in this tier). We are committed to generating our energy and managing our assets sustainably, and we believe that we are one of the first vertically integrated crypto asset mining companies with a focus on environmentally beneficial operations. Owning our own source of power helps us to produce Bitcoin at one of the lowest prices among our publicly traded peers. We also believe that owning our own power source makes us a more attractive partner to crypto asset mining equipment purveyors. We completed our previously disclosed acquisition of a second coal refuse power generation facility and have entered into a non-binding letter of intent to purchase a third coal refuse power generation facility (the \"Third Plant\"). We intend to leverage these competitive advantages to continue to grow our business through the opportunistic acquisition of additional power generating assets and miners.\nThe below presents summarized results for our operations for the two reporting segments: Energy Operations and Cryptocurrency Operations.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, other income (expense) amounted to $(5.1) million of expense compared to $2.3 million of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense increased in 2021 to $4.6 million compared to $205.5 thousand in December 31, 2020. The increase in interest expense was driven by $(1.1) million from changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, and $(116.5) thousand from changes in fair value of forward sale derivatives. We did not have outstanding warrants for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as the equity offerings occurred as part of the reorganization on April 1, 2021, and the subsequent private placement funding. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we significantly improved our liquidity and capability to expand our power and mining assets through borrowings and master equipment financing agreements. As a result, the $(4.4) million increase in interest expenses, from this required financing, was realized so we could purchase miners and transformers to support the acceleration of the crypto asset ramp ups. Negative impacts of these increases are partially offset by the gains from the extinguishment of the $638.8 thousand PPP loan in January 2021. The prior comparable period, the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, benefited from the $1.2 million gains from closing out all derivatives (i.e. hedging positions), and $1.1 million in waste coal credits discussed above.\nCOVID-19 and Supply Chain Constraints\nScrubgrass Plant\n\u2022Constraining estimates of variable consideration\n\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral and administrative expenses include legal and professional fees, consulting costs, executive and support payroll, stock compensation expense, property taxes, insurance premiums related to coverages and rates, and management fees. The majority of general and administrative costs are allocated between the two segments using a fair-share\u201d of revenues approach, where the revenue for the segment is divided by the total combined revenues of the segments and is then multiplied by the shared general and administrative costs for the combined segments. Panther Creek G&A was $115.4 thousand.\nagreement with an affiliate of Arctos Credit, LLC ( Arctos,\u201d now known as NYDIG\u201d) (the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement. The aggregate principal outstanding bears interest of 10% and will be repaid in 24 monthly payments, with a 1.25% fee due if the Maximum Advance Amount is not requested prior to August 15, 2021. Outstanding borrowings under the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement are secured by certain miners and the contracts to acquire the such miners. The Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement includes customary restrictions on additional liens on the Arctos/NYDIG-Financed Equipment. As of September 30, 2021, $24.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) has been borrowed, leaving, approximately $10.3 million remaining available to be drawn under the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement. The Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement may not be terminated by us or prepaid in whole or in part. In conjunction with the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement, we issued 126,273 shares of Class A common stock to Arctos (adjusted for the Stock Split) and may issue additional shares of Class A common stock to Arctos in consideration of future financings.\nOperating expenses increased by $27.1 million, or 453.4%, to approximately $33.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $6.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nGeneral and administrative\nWe have entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts, as amended from time to time, with the mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and our enforceable right to compensation only begins when we provide computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, we are entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are recorded as a component of cost of revenues), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain. The terms of the agreement provide that neither party can dispute settlement terms after thirty-five days following settlement. Our fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power we contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe miners purchased pursuant to the two agreements with Bitmain will have an aggregate hash rate capacity of approximately 1,450 PH/s.\nWe provide capacity to a customer through participation in capacity auctions held by the PJM RTO. Capacity revenues are a series of distinct performance obligations that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time and are therefore accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. The transaction price for capacity is market-based and constitutes the stand-alone selling price. As capacity represents our stand-ready obligation, capacity revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied ratably over time, on a monthly basis, since we stand ready equally throughout the period to deliver power to the PJM RTO if called upon. We apply the invoice practical expedient in recognizing capacity revenue. Under the invoice practical expedient, capacity revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is considered equal to the value provided to the customer for our performance obligation completed to date. Penalties may be assessed by the PJM RTO against generation facilities if the facility is not available during the capacity period. The penalties assessed by the PJM RTO, if any, are recorded as a reduction to capacity revenue when incurred.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $294.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.4 million provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The significant increase of $292.8 million in cash provided by financing activities was a culmination of receiving $131.5 million in proceeds from the initial public offering (net of transaction fees) and $96.8 million (net of transaction fees) from our private placement equity raises of Series A Stock and Series B Stock. In addition, proceeds from the WhiteHawk Promissory Note of $39.1 million (net of debt issuance costs), as discussed in Note 14 - Stocks Issued Under Master Financing Agreements and Warrants,\" in the notes to our financial statements, $24.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) drawn against the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement (as defined below), discussed in \"Note 14 - Stocks Issued Under Master Financing Agreements and Warrants\" in the notes our financial statements; $17.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) received in advances from the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement as discussed in Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies\", the $7.0 million prepayment from the variable forward asset sales contract. This was partially offset by a $(2.0) million payoff of two related-party notes, $(2.0) million cash portion of the $(7.0) million buyout of the Aspen Interest, and (16.3) million in debt payments that are substantially related to the loans previously mentioned, and -$2.6 million paid on the financed insurance premium as discussed in Note 29 - Commercial Premium Financing Agreement. We received a second round PPP loan in March 2021 in the amount of $841.7 thousand. The first PPP loan received in May 2020 for $638.8 thousand was forgiven in January 2021. We are in the process of seeking forgiveness of our second PPP loan of $841.7 thousand. Additionally, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan received in June 2020 in the amount of $150.0 thousand was paid off on June 7, 2021.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $(257.0) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $(1.8) million used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The $(257.0) million net cash used in investing activities was attributable to the continued ramp up of the crypto asset segment. These investments require significant deposits by equipment vendors as commitments for future deliveries of miners, increasing the production bandwidths by building out our power and container infrastructures, and the implementation of any additional miners starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 into the full year ending 2021. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $490.0 thousand in acquired Panther Creek cash. The $(1.8) million in net cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December, 2020 includes $(2.0) million in construction in progress and miner acquisition costs due to the start of developing the power and mining infrastructure for future cryptocurrency miners.\nInterest Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses include legal and professional fees, consulting fees, stock compensation expenses, executive and support payroll, property taxes, insurance premiums related to coverages and rates, and management fees. The majority of general and administrative costs are allocated between the two segments using a fair-share\u201d of revenues approach, where the revenue for the segment is divided by the total combined revenues of the segments and is then multiplied by the shared general and administrative costs for the combined segments.\nIn May 2021, the Chinese government called for a crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading. Following this, the majority of Bitcoin miners in China were taken offline. This resulted in (i) a significant reduction in the Bitcoin global network hash rate, (ii) an increase in the availability of Bitcoin miners for purchase and (iii) an increase in the demand for power outside of China. Further, in September 2021, Chinese regulators instituted a blanket ban on all crypto mining and transactions, including overseas crypto exchange services taking place in China, effectively making all crypto-related activities illegal in China. The reduction in network hash rate has improved Bitcoin mining profitability, with plugged-in Bitcoin miners representing a larger percentage of the global hash rate. We do not believe that higher demand for power will have a negative impact on our business because we own and operate our power sources.\nCrypto asset mining revenue\nIncluding $5.8 million from the Panther Creek Plant, total operating expenses increased by $46.6 million or 714.2%; The increase in total operating expenses was partially attributable to increases of $12.8 million in fuel for the Scrubgrass Plant to produce higher MW capacity to provide power to the energy operations and cryptocurrency operations segments. The Scrubgrass Plant was relatively dormant for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, we experienced an increase of $12.2 million in operations and maintenance expenses related to the energy ramp-up requiring labor, vehicles, and major upgrades so the Scrubgrass Plant can be fully operational at the required higher capacities. Further, we had an increase of $12.7 million in general and administrative expenses due to legal and professional fees, consulting fees, stock compensation expenses, increased insurance costs, and compensation as we continue to organize and scale to a larger legal structure. Impairment costs of $1.9 million were attributed to the declines in the Bitcoin market pricing, primarily during the August 2021 to December 2021 timeframes. We also recorded $7.6 million in depreciation, an increase of approximately $7.0 million over the comparable period in 2020, due to the ramp-up of capital expenditures required for miners and transformers to grow the cryptocurrency hosting and mining infrastructures that produce increased hash rates.\nDerivative Contracts\nNYDIG ABL LLC Financing Agreement\n2.Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nOperations and maintenance\n5.Step 5: Recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation\nLoss per share\nOur historical financial results discussed below may not be comparable to our future financial results for the reasons described below.\nThe amount of income taxes we record requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, and local tax jurisdictions. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized after considering all positive and negative evidence available concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets.\nPost IPO Taxation and Public Company Costs\nOn November 16, 2021, we entered into a second agreement with Bitmain to purchase 1,800 miners, which will be delivered in six equal batches on a monthly basis beginning in July 2022 (the \"Second Bitmain Purchase Agreement\"). Per the Second Bitmain Purchase Agreement, on November 18, 2021, we made an initial payment of $6,835,000 to Bitmain for the miners. Subsequent payments will be made in the future in connection with additional deliveries of miners under the Second Bitmain Purchase Agreement.\n\nIncome Taxes\nWe rely on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), a non-GAAP (as defined below) key performance metric, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset (group) that is held and used must be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (group) might not be recoverable (i.e., information indicates that an impairment might exist). We are responsible for routinely assessing whether impairment indicators are present and should have systems or processes to assist in the identification of potential impairment indicators.\nAsset retirement obligations, including those conditioned on future events, are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset in the same period. In each subsequent period, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the EUL of the long-lived asset. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, we recognize a gain or loss on settlement. Our asset retirement obligation represents the cost we would incur to perform environmental clean-up or dismantle certain portions of the Facility.\nWe record notes payable net of any discounts or premiums. Discounts and premiums are amortized as interest expense or income over the life of the note in such a way as to result in a constant rate of interest when applied to the amount outstanding at the beginning of any given period.\ncash flows are impacted by the accounting policies the Company has adopted. In order to get a full understanding of the Company's financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed.\nExcept as otherwise indicated or required by the context, all references in this prospectus to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d relate to Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. ( Stronghold Inc.\u201d) and its consolidated subsidiaries following the Reorganization.\nOn October 28, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Bitmain Technologies Limited ( Bitmain\u201d) to purchase 12,000 miners, which will be delivered in six equal batches on a monthly basis beginning in April 2022 (the \"First Bitmain Purchase Agreement\"). Per the First Bitmain Purchase Agreement, on October 29, 2021, we made an initial payment of $23,300,000 to Bitmain for the miners, On November 18, 2021, we made an additional payment of $4,550,000. Subsequent payments will be made in the future in connection with additional deliveries of miners under the First Bitmain Purchase Agreement.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( Topic 842\u201d), which supersedes ASC Topic 840, Leases. Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. Topic 842 will be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. In November 2020, FASB deferred the effective date for implementation of Topic 842 by one year and, in June 2020, FASB deferred the effective date by an additional year. Beginning after December 15, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, the guidance under Topic 842 is effective. We are still in the process of developing our new accounting policies and determining the potential aggregate impact this guidance is likely to have on our financial statements as of its adoption date.\nWhen determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:\nIncluding $2.6 million from Panther Creek, fuel expense, after $(2.5) million in subsidized power costs from the crypto operations segment, increased by $10.4 million, or 3,278.4%, to approximately $10.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $316.0 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The subsidized power costs are for providing power to the crypto hosting and mining assets at a market price of $0.027 per kWh. The $10.4 million increase in fuel expenses compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to the continued expansions of energy production and the required coal, ash and limestone fuel purchases to generate energy to support the expansions. The fuel purchases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were very minimal as the Scrubgrass Plant was just starting to ramp up capacity, and both the crypto hosting and mining assets were relatively non-existent and did not purchase power from the Scrubgrass Plant.\n1 Includes the following non-recurring expenses: legal fees related to the Panther Creek Acquisition and the Northern Data Hosting Agreement, bad debt write-offs, startup costs related to initial crypto asset stores inventories, out-of-the-ordinary major repairs and upgrades to the power plant, and other one-time items.\nAs of the year ended December 31, 2021, we maintained a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance remains in place based on the uncertainty of future events, including the Company's ability to generate future taxable income in light of its recent losses, and management considered this and other factors in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Any changes in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if our deferred tax assets will be realized could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have no material off balance sheet arrangements.\nAs previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, stock-based compensation and business combinations. The Company's financial position, results of operations and\nTotal operating revenues increased by $12.6 million, or 357.2%, to $16.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, from $3.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Our Future Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations\nWe record warrant liabilities at their fair value as of the balance sheet date, and recognizes changes in the balances, over the comparative periods of either the issuance date or the last reporting date, as part of changes in fair value of warrant liabilities expense. At the issuance date, each series of warrants were convertible and redeemable to preferred stock.\nTwelve months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nTotal net obligations under all debt agreements as of December 31, 2021, including a second round PPP loan of $841.7 thousand, were $65.0 million.\nOn December 10, 2021, we entered into a Hardware Purchase and Sale Agreement (the First Supplier Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire 3,000 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S miners (the M30S Miners\u201d) with a hash rate per unit of 87 TH/s\u201d. Pursuant to the First Supplier Purchase Agreement, the unit price per M30S Miner is $6,960 for a cumulative purchase price of $20,880,000 that was paid in full within five business days of the execution of the First Supplier Purchase Agreement.\nmillion from hosting and an increase of $12.2 million from mining. The growth in the crypto asset mining revenue is the result of the significant ramp up of miner and transformer installations during the second half of 2021.\nOn November 2, 2021, we entered into the Operations, Maintenance and Ancillary Services Agreement (the Omnibus Services Agreement\u201d) with Olympus Stronghold Services, LLC ( Olympus Stronghold Services\u201d), whereby Olympus Stronghold Services will provide certain operations and maintenance services to Stronghold LLC, as well as employ certain personnel to operate the Panther Creek Plant and the Scrubgrass Plant. Stronghold LLC will reimburse Olympus Stronghold Services for those costs incurred by Olympus Stronghold Services and approved by Stronghold LLC in the course of providing services under the Omnibus Services Agreement, including payroll and benefits costs and insurance costs. The material costs incurred by Olympus Stronghold Services shall be approved by Stronghold LLC. Stronghold LLC will also pay Olympus Stronghold Services a management fee at the rate of $1,000,000 per year, payable monthly, and an additional one-time mobilization fee of $150,000 upon the effective date of the Omnibus Services Agreement. Refer to \"Note 9 - Related Party Transactions\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nOperating Expenses\nStock Based Compensation\nBitcoin Mining Growth\nFair value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt. There is currently no specific definitive guidance under GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for cryptocurrencies recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the FASB, we may be required to change our policies, which could have an effect on our consolidated financial position and results from operations.\nOur cash needs are primarily for growth through acquisitions and working capital to support equipment financing and the purchase of additional miners. We have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses in servicing and maintaining our power generation facilities. If we were to acquire additional facilities in the future, capital expenditures may include improvements, maintenance, and buildout costs associated with enabling such facilities to house miners to mine Bitcoin.\nCryptech Solutions Purchase Agreement\nOperating expenses increased to $19.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $542.9 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There were minimal hosting customers and a very insignificant hash rate output due to a small number of miners for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, resulting in very small costs to operate. Of the $19.7 million in operating expenses, approximately 32.0% are attributed to depreciation and amortization relative to the ramping up of our cryptocurrency miner assets that have two year useful lives; whereas 40.4% of the $19.7 million operating expenses are general and administrative expenses that includes stock compensation expenses, and startup costs related to legal and consulting.\nIf a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.\nOn June 30, 2021, we entered into an equipment financing agreement (the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement\u201d) with WhiteHawk Finance LLC (\"Whitehawk\") whereby WhiteHawk agreed to lend to us an aggregate amount not to exceed $40.0 million (the Total Advance\u201d) to finance the purchase of certain Bitcoin miners and related equipment (the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment\u201d). At August 30, 2021, the entirety of the Total Advance was drawn under the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement. The aggregate principal outstanding bears interest of 10% and will be repaid in 24 monthly payments. Outstanding borrowings under the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement are secured by the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment and the contracts to acquire the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment. The WhiteHawk Financing Agreement includes customary restrictions on additional liens on the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment and is guaranteed by the Company. The WhiteHawk Financing Agreement may be terminated early if we, among other things, pay the Early Termination Fee (as defined therein). In conjunction with the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement, we issued a stock purchase warrant to WhiteHawk, which provides for the purchase of a number of shares of Class A common stock at $0.01 per share, equal to approximately $2.0 million, subject to adjustment as described in the warrant agreement (the WhiteHawk Warrant\u201d). The WhiteHawk Warrant expires on June 30, 2031.\nWe recognize revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of this revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\nAs we further implement controls, processes and infrastructure applicable to companies with publicly traded equity securities, it is likely that we will incur additional selling, general and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses relative to historical periods. Our future results will depend on our ability to efficiently manage our combined operations and execute our business strategy.\nCryptocurrency Machines\nWe have entered into customer hosting contracts whereby we provide electrical power to cryptocurrency mining customers, and the customers pay a stated amount per MWh ( Contract Capacity\u201d). This amount is paid monthly in advance. Amounts used in excess of the Contract Capacity are billed based upon calculated formulas as contained in the contracts. If any shortfalls occur due to outages, make-whole payment provisions contained in the contracts are used to offset the billings to the customer which prevented them from cryptocurrency mining. Advanced payments and customer deposits are reflected as contract liabilities.\nEquipment Purchase and Financing Transactions\nIncluding $3.1 million from the Panther Creek Plant, revenue from the generation of energy increased by $11.4 million, or 2,189.9%, to approximately $11.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $518.4 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was the result of the plant energy production no longer remaining relatively dormant as was the case during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Full plant power utilization is optimal for our revenue growth as it also drives a higher volume of Tier II Renewable Energy Credits (\"RECs\"), waste coal tax credits, and beneficial use ash sales, as well as the increased power bandwidths for the crypto asset operations.\nOn June 25, 2021, we entered into a $34,481,700 (\"Maximum Advance Amount\") master equipment financing\nOur board of directors (the Board\u201d) and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation, amortization, impairment, and realized gains and losses on sale of long-term assets) and other items (such as one-time transaction costs, expenses related to stock-based compensation, and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts)\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted by the removal of one-time transaction costs, periodic impairment of digital currencies, realized gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets, expenses related to stock-based compensation, gains or losses on derivative contracts, gain on extinguishment of debt, realized gain or loss on sale of digital currencies, waste coal credits, commission on sale of ash, or changes in fair value of warrant liabilities in the period presented.\nHighlights of our consolidated results of operations for twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 include the effect of the Panther Creek Acquisition (refer to Note 25 - Acquisitions\" in notes to our financial statements) that closed on November 2, 2021. The Panther Creek Plant operates as part of our Energy Segment.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes Between the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nKey Performance Metrics\nNYDIG ABL LLC\n2021 Highlights\ndetermined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, stock-based compensation and business combinations. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies we have adopted. In order to get a full understanding of our financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed.\nWe paid for three separate purchases of miners from Luxor. The first purchase payment was made on November 26, 2021, in the amount of $4,312,650 for 770 miners. The second and third purchase payments were made on November 29, 2021, in the amount of $5,357,300 and $3,633,500 respectively; for an additional 750 and 500 miners.\nOn December 16, 2021, we entered into a Second Hardware Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Second Supplier Purchase Agreement\") to acquire a cumulative amount of approximately 4,280 M30S Miners and MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S+ miners with a hash rate per unit of 100 TH/s (the M30S+ Miners\u201d). Pursuant to the Second Supplier Purchase Agreement, the unit price per M30S Miner is $2,714 and the unit price per M30S+ Miner is $3,520 for a cumulative purchase price of $11,340,373.\nTwo draws against the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement totaled $17.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) secured by our equipment contract commitments for future miner deliveries. As of December 31, 2021, the amount owed under the debt agreements totaled $17.2 million with repayment terms extending through December 2023. Of the total amount outstanding of $17.2 million, $13.8 million was classified as current portion of long-term debt (less discounts and debt issuance costs) and will be repaid as of December 15, 2023. The remaining portion of long-term debt is $3.4 million (less discounts and debt issuance costs). As of December 31, 2021, the monthly repayment amounts, including interest, totaled $18.6 million. For additional information, see Note 6 - Long-Term Debt\u201d in the notes to our financial statements.\nWe have historically relied on funds from equity issuances, equipment financings, and revenue from sales of Bitcoin and power generated at our power plants to provide for our liquidity needs. During 2021, we received $63.2 million (net of loan fees and debt issuance costs) in proceeds from the financing agreements with WhiteHawk and NYDIG, net proceeds of $131.5 million from the IPO and net proceeds of $96.8 million from two private placements of convertible preferred securities. Additionally, on March 28, 2022, we received an additional $25.0 million from WhiteHawk as a result of the Second WhiteHawk Amendment. Please see -Debt Agreements - Equipment Purchase and Financing Transactions\u201d for more information regarding our financing arrangements. These cash sources provided additional short and long-term liquidity to support our operations in fiscal year 2021 and through the first quarter of 2022. Taking into account the Second WhiteHawk Amendment and other sources of capital, such as proceeds from asset sales or additional sources of debt or equity financing, to which we believe we have access, we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next twelve months. We anticipate also that we will need additional sources of capital and will need to increase our cash flow from operations and financing activities for our long-term capital needs including to fund our business plan and to meet our long-term operating requirements. We may sell assets or seek potential additional debt or equity financing to fund our short-term and long-term needs. If we are unable to ramp up our Bitcoin mining efforts and raise additional capital, there is a risk that we could default on our obligations and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of our operations, including through the sale of our assets, if no other means of financing options are available. As of December 31, 2021 and March 24, 2022, we had 182 and 344 Bitcoins on hand, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and March 28, 2022, we had approximately $39.5 million and approximately $32 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and March 28, 2022, we had outstanding indebtedness of $68.5 million and $117.8 million, respectively, and availability under our financing agreements of $35.4 million and $18.0 million, respectively.\nWe completed the issuance and sale of our Class A common stock, par value $.0001 per share, in an initial public offering (the \"IPO\") on October 22, 2021, and our Class A common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol SDIG.\u201d Refer to \"Note 27 - Initial Public Offering\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nthat impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing our financial performance and results of operations across reporting periods by excluding items we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nTo the extent that any of the assumptions underlying management's estimate of useful life of its transaction verification servers are subject to revision in a future reporting period either as a result of changes in circumstances or through the availability of greater quantities of data then the estimated useful life could change and have a prospective impact on depreciation expense and the carrying amounts of these assets.\nAs an emerging growth company\u201d ( EGC\u201d), the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ( JOBS Act\u201d) allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. The adoption dates discussed below reflect this election.\nThe cryptocurrency operations segment purchases power from the Scrubgrass Plant at $0.027 per kWh to provide power to both the hosted customer and Bitcoin mining equipment. The $2.4 million increase compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to the continued expansions of these assets and customer strategy, as discussed previously, starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 with significant ramp up starting in the second half of 2021.\nThe crypto spot market is volatile and can have a negative impact on the mark-to-market of our digital currencies as of the ending balance sheet reporting date. As a result, a $1.9 million impairment charge was recognized as a result of the negative impacts from the crypto coin spot market declines against the held crypto coin inventories not yet converted to cash. As of December 31, 2021, the Company held on its balance sheet approximately 182 Bitcoin and the spot market price of Bitcoin was $47,686.81 per Coinbase Global Inc.\nWe paid for three separate purchases of miners from Luxor Technology Corporation (\"Luxor\"). The first purchase payment was made on November 26, 2021, in the amount of $4,312,650 for 770 miners. The second and third purchase payments were made on November 29, 2021, in the amount of $5,357,300 and $3,633,500 respectively, for an additional 750 and 500 miners.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, incremental, non-recurring costs related to our transition to a publicly traded corporation, including the costs of the IPO and the costs associated with the initial implementation of our internal control reviews and testing pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"). We have also incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional significant and recurring expenses as a publicly traded corporation, including costs associated with compliance under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, annual and quarterly reports to common stockholders, registrar and transfer agent fees, national stock exchange fees, audit fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and director and officer compensation. Our financial statements following the IPO will continue to reflect the impact of these expenses.\nAs a result, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.9 million, or 270.8%, to approximately $6.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $1.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The cryptocurrency operations segment revenue was minimal for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, so the energy operations segment realized large portion of the general and administrative costs during this time. The majority of the $4.9 million increase was due to legal and professional fees, consulting startup costs, stock compensation expenses, as well as the execution of additional contracts to scale our legal structures and borrowing capabilities during this period. In addition, the payment of delinquent property taxes and the increases in insurance coverages and rates due to the purchase of a director and officer liability insurance policy, higher asset exposures, as well as higher rates in the risk markets contributed to the increase.\nNotes Payable\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing into 2022, the Scrubgrass Plant had downtime that was greater than anticipated, driven largely by mechanical failures. The upgrades and maintenance that are necessary have taken longer and are more extensive than originally anticipated. We expect these investments to be completed in the second half of 2022. Once finished, the Scrubgrass Plant is expected to be operational at nameplate capacity with high uptime and low operating costs.\n\u2022The existence of a significant financing component in the contract\nEnergy Operations Segment\nconsummate a change of control or reduce the proceeds received by our stockholders in connection with a change of control. However, Stronghold Inc. may be required to fund such payment from other sources, and as a result, any early termination of the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity or financial condition.\n\nTotal operating revenues increased by $14.2 million, or 2,399.2%, to $14.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, from $591.9 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nRevenue generated from crypto asset mining increased by $12.2 million, or 3,580.8%, to approximately $12.49 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $339.5 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of the significant purchases of miners and transformers, with the expansions that started during the fourth quarter of 2020 through the end of 2021. The deployments of these miners and transformers are significantly increasing total hash rates and Bitcoin awards.\nFair value of the digital asset award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt.\nVariable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate. There were no revenue streams with variable consideration during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nOn November 30, 2021, we entered into a fourth purchase agreement with Luxor to acquire 400 Antminer T19 miners with a hash rate of 84 TH/s and 400 Antminer T19 miners with a hash rate of 88 TH/s for a total purchase price of $6,260,800.\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and\nInterest Expense\nOn November 16, 2021, we entered into the second Non-Fixed Price Sales and Purchase Agreement with Bitmain. This second agreement covers six batches of 300 miners, or 1,800 in total, arriving on a monthly basis from July 2022 through December 2022. Each batch has an assigned purchase price that totals $19,350,000, to be paid in three installments of 35%, 35%, and 30% of the total purchase price over the six month delivery period. Per the second Non-Fixed Price Sales and Purchase Agreement, on November 18, 2021, the Company paid the first installment payment of 35% or $6,835,000.\nConsolidated Results- for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nThere is currently no specific definitive guidance under GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for cryptocurrencies recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), we may be required to change our policies, which could have an effect on our condensed consolidated financial position and results from operations.\nChina's Crackdown on Bitcoin Mining\nComparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nadditional 2,675 miners at cost of $37.5 per terahash (to be paid five months after delivery) and temporarily reduced the profit share for Northern Data while incorporating performance thresholds until the data center build-out is complete. Refer to \"Note 28 - Hosting Services Agreement\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nOn August 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Northern Data PA, LLC ( Northern Data\u201d) whereby Northern Data will construct and operate a colocation datacenter facility located on the Scrubgrass Plant (the Hosting Agreement\u201d), the primary business purpose of which will be to provide hosting services and support the cryptocurrency miners that we have purchased but not yet received entirely. On March 28, 2022, we restructured the Hosting Agreement to obtain an\nOn December 15, 2021, we entered into a Master Equipment Finance Agreement (the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement\u201d) with NYDIG ABL LLC ( NYDIG\u201d) whereby NYDIG agreed to lend Stronghold Digital Mining BT, LLC (\"Digital Mining BT\") up to $53,952,000 to finance the purchase of certain Bitcoin miners and related equipment (the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment\u201d). Outstanding borrowings under the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement are secured by the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment, contracts to acquire Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment, and the Bitcoin mined by the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment. The Second NYDIG Financing Agreement includes customary restrictions on additional liens on the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment. The NYDIG Second Financing Agreement may not be terminated by Digital Mining BT or prepaid in whole or in part. Refer to \"Note 6 - Long-Term Debt\" and \"Note 32 - Subsequent Events\" in our notes to our financial statements.\nThe accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management. These assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change. Material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the potential for income tax audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters.\n3.Technological obsolescence reflecting rapid development in the transaction verification server industry such that more recently developed hardware is more economically efficient to run in terms of digital assets generated as a function of operating costs, primarily power costs, (i.e., the speed of hardware evolution in the industry is such that later hardware models generally have faster processing capacity combined with lower operating costs and a lower cost of purchase).\nWith the full deployment of these new miners, including the remaining 11,700 MinerVa miners, which we do not know when they will be delivered, if at all, our total fleet is currently expected to comprise approximately 57,000 total miners by December 2022 and consume approximately 200 MW of electricity.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nThe majority of the depreciation and amortization expense that marginally increased by $746.8 thousand, or 133.7%, to approximately $1.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, from $558.6 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was due to $732.1 thousand from Panther Creek.\nWe effected 2.88-for-1 stock split on October 22, 2021, pursuant to which each share of common stock held of record by the holder thereof was reclassified into approximately 2.88 shares of common stock. No fractional shares were issued. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Stronghold LLC, as amended from time to time, each Stronghold LLC Unit was also split on a corresponding 2.88-for-1 basis, such that there are an equivalent number of Stronghold LLC Units outstanding as the aggregate number of shares of Class V common stock and Class A common stock outstanding following the stock split. We refer to this collectively as the Stock Split.\u201d\nInitial Public Offering\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nWe measure at fair value certain of our financial and non-financial assets and liabilities by using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially an exit price, based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\nAs of January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted Topic 606 under the modified retrospective approach whereby the cumulative effect of adopting the new guidance was recognized on the date of initial application. The adoption of ASC 606 did not result in a change to the accounting for revenue, as such, no cumulative effect adjustment was recorded.\nIncluding $3.8 million from the Panther Creek Plant, total revenue from all segments increased by $26.8 million, or 650.7%, to approximately $30.9 million primarily driven by large increases in both the energy and crypto asset mining revenues. Energy generation and the continued ramp up to full MW capacity contributed to approximately $11.4 million or 2189.9%. Additionally, total crypto asset revenue growth of approximately $14.2 million included approximately $2.0\nFuel - purchased from energy segment\nWe also entered into two additional separate purchases of miners from Nowlit Solutions Corp. The first purchase payment was made on November 23, 2021, in the amount of $1,605,360 for 190 miners. The second purchase payment was made on November 26, 2021, in the amount of $2,486,730 for an additional 295 miners.\nNowlit Solutions Corp Purchase Agreement\nWe continue to evaluate the acquisition of the Third Plant as contemplated by the Olympus LOI, although the acquisition of the Third Plant is subject to further due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement, and there is no assurance that the acquisition will be completed. The acquisition of the Third Plant is subject to further due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement, and there is no assurance that the acquisition will be completed. The consideration for the Third Plant is expected to be approximately $3.0 million in cash and 6,250,000 of Stronghold LLC Units, together with a corresponding number of shares of Class V common stock. If acquired, we plan to store newly acquired miners at or near the Third Plant and use power generated by the Third Plant to power crypto asset mining operations in an environmentally conscious manner. We are also strategically pursuing acquisitions of additional assets.\nInterest expense decreased by $124.6 thousand, or (60.6)%, to $(80.9) thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $(205.5) thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as loans were either paid off or later in their terms with lower interest portions of their payments. Panther Creek had marginal impacts to Interest Expense.\nSegment Results\n3.Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n\u2022Variable consideration\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDepreciation and Amortization\nCash Flows\nOur policies with respect to our revenue streams are detailed below.\n\nDebt Agreements\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans, expectations and strategy for our business, and operations, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see section above entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risks may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion and analysis. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those described under the heading Risk Factors\u201d and discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n4.Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nOn December 16, 2021, we entered into a Second Hardware Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Second Supplier Purchase Agreement\") to acquire a cumulative amount of approximately 4,280 M30S Miners and MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S+ miners with a hash rate per unit of 100 TH/s (the M30S+ Miners\u201d). Pursuant to the Second Supplier Purchase Agreement, the unit price per M30S Miner is $2,714 and the unit price per M30S+ Miner is $3,520 for a cumulative purchase price of $11,340,373.\nWe entered into the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement on June 30, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the amount owed under the debt agreements totaled $40.7 million with repayment terms extending through June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, the monthly repayment amounts, including interest, total 30.7 million. For additional information, see Note 6 - Long-Term Debt\u201d in the notes to our financial statements.\nWe have not yet established a consistent, ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs, and we incurred a net loss of $27.3 million in fiscal 2021 and an accumulated deficit of $338.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The losses incurred in recent years, with the associated substantial accumulated deficit, are a result of our Bitcoin mining ramp-up, which is a capital intensive industry. We experienced a number of setbacks and unexpected challenges, including a longer-than-expected delay of the MinerVa miners and longer than expected downtime at our Scrubgrass Plant for maintenance. As a result of the delay in delivery of the MinerVa miners, we were at risk of defaulting on our obligations under the WhiteHawk debt facility because those miners were to be provided as collateral to WhiteHawk by April 30, 2022. We spent approximately $5.1 million in fiscal year 2021 on maintenance and repair costs at the Scrubgrass Plant, and we estimate that we will spend an aggregate of $30 million on total repair and maintenance cost in fiscal 2022. In addition to incurred expenses, we are also unable to mine Bitcoin at the Scrubgrass Plant during such downtime, which directly and negatively affects our results of operations. Due to these and the other operational setbacks discussed herein, we estimate that such factors have negatively impacted our cash on hand by approximately $40 million to $45 million as of March 24, 2022 compared to if miners had been delivered in accordance with the original delivery schedules under purchase agreements and the Scrubgrass Plant's uptime was as expected. As a result of these events, we faced a significant liquidity shortfall that reduced our cash position to approximately $3 million on March 28, 2022, with available funding of another $18 million. In response, we sought and obtained the Second WhiteHawk Amendment to substitute collateral, avoid an event of default, and obtain additional funding to address our near-term liquidity needs. We believe our liquidity position, combined with expected operating cash flow and the proceeds of additional debt or equity financings or asset sales, will be sufficient to meet our existing commitments and fund our operations for the next twelve months.\n\nOn April 2, 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement with MinerVa for the acquisition of 15,000 of their MV7 ASIC SHA256 model cryptocurrency miner equipment (miners) with a total terahash to be delivered equal to 1.5 million terahash. The price per miner is $4,892.50 for an aggregate purchase price of $73,387,500 to be paid in installments. The first installment of 60% of the purchase price, or $44,032,500, was paid on April 2, 2021, and an additional payment of 20% of the purchase price, or $14,677,500, was paid on June 2, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, there are no remaining deposits owed. In December 2021, we extended the deadline for delivery of the MinerVa miners to April 2022. In March 2022, MinerVa was again unable to meet its delivery date and has only delivered approximately 3,200 of the 15,000 miners. We do not know when the remaining MinerVa miners will be received, if at all. As a result, we may write off some or all of the approximately 11,700 undelivered MinerVa miners. MinerVa continues to tell us that MinerVa anticipates shipping no less than 15,000 miners by April 2022. Refer to Note 30 - Covenants that describe covenants referencing the anticipated final delivery timeframe of April 2022. Please see \"Note 32 - Subsequent Events\" in the notes to our financial statements for further disclosure on payment of the remaining 20%. In exchange for the delivery of the miners that are operating under the specifications set forth in the purchase agreement, we will grant the seller 443,848 shares of our Class A common stock at a price per share of $8.68 (adjusted for the Stock Split). The aggregate purchase price does not include shipping costs, which are our responsibility and shall be determined at which time the miners are ready for shipment.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nLuxor Technology Corporation Purchase Agreement\nIncluding $681.7 thousand from the Panther Creek Plant, revenue generated from capacity increased by $1.4 million, or 50.5%, to approximately $4.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $2.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of the successful ramp up of MW capacity in 2021; coupled with higher pricing per kilowatt hour (\"kWh\") on the higher capacity usages.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity's own assumptions.\nOperating Revenues\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.

Pursuant to the Cryptech Purchase Agreement, all hardware will be paid for in advance of being shipped to the Company.\nA financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nA summary of our critical accounting policies follows:\nOverview\nTwo draws against the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement (as defined below) totaled $24.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) secured by our equipment contract commitments for future miner deliveries. As of December 31, 2021, the amount owed under the debt agreements totaled $21.9 million with repayment terms extending through July 25, 2023. Of the total amount outstanding of $21.9 million, $12.0 million was classified as current portion of long-term debt (less discounts and debt issuance costs) and will be repaid as of July 25, 2023. The remaining portion of long-term debt is $9.9 million (less discounts and debt issuance costs). As of December 31, 2021, the monthly repayment amounts, including interest, totaled $19.0 million. For additional information, see Note 6 - Long-Term Debt\u201d in the notes to our financial statements.\nWe have entered into various debt agreements used to purchase equipment to operate our business.\nEnergy Revenue\nhas caused supply chain disruptions that may have lasting impacts. Additionally, the global supply chain for Bitcoin miners is presently further constrained due to unprecedented demand coupled with a global shortage of mining equipment and mining equipment parts. Based on our current assessments, however, we do not expect any material impact on long-term development, operations, or liquidity due to the spread of COVID-19. However, we are actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, and industry.\n\nThe miners purchased pursuant to the two agreements with Bitmain will have an aggregate hash rate capacity of approximately 1,450 PH/s.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nGeneral and administrative\nProviding computing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of our ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in our contracts with mining pool operators. The transaction consideration we receive, if any, is noncash consideration, which we measure at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time we have earned the award from the pools. The consideration is all variable. Because it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur, the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and we receive confirmation of the consideration we will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.\nFuel - net of crypto segment subsidy\nThe actual timing and amount of any payments that may be made under the TRA are unknown at this time and will vary based on a number of factors. However, Stronghold Inc. expects that the payments that it will be required to make to Q Power (or its permitted assignees) in connection with the TRA will be substantial. Any payments made by Stronghold Inc. to Q Power (or its permitted assignees) under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of cash that might have otherwise been available to Stronghold Inc. or Stronghold LLC. To the extent Stronghold LLC has available cash and subject to the terms of any current or future debt or other agreements, the Stronghold LLC Agreement will require Stronghold LLC to make pro rata cash distributions to holders of Stronghold LLC Units, including Stronghold Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow Stronghold Inc. to pay its taxes and to make payments under the TRA. Stronghold Inc. generally expects Stronghold LLC to fund such distributions out of available cash. However, except in cases where Stronghold Inc. elects to terminate the TRA early, the TRA is terminated early due to certain mergers or other changes of control or Stronghold Inc. has available cash but fails to make payments when due, generally Stronghold Inc. may defer payments due under the TRA if it does not have available cash to satisfy its payment obligations under the TRA or if its contractual obligations limit its ability to make these payments. Any such deferred payments under the TRA generally will accrue interest at the rate provided for in the TRA, and such interest may significantly exceed Stronghold Inc.'s other costs of capital. If Stronghold Inc. experiences a change of control (as defined under the TRA, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations), and in certain other circumstances, payments under the TRA may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, Stronghold Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA. In the case of such an acceleration in connection with a change of control, where applicable, Stronghold Inc. generally expects the accelerated payments due under the TRA to be funded out of the proceeds of the change of control transaction giving rise to such acceleration, which could have a significant impact on our ability to\nThe TRA generally provides for the payment by Stronghold Inc. to certain of the Stronghold Unit Holders of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax (computed using the estimated impact of state and local taxes) that Stronghold Inc. actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) certain increases in tax basis that occur as a result of Stronghold Inc.'s acquisition (or deemed acquisition for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of all or a portion of such holder's Stronghold LLC Units pursuant to an exercise of Redemption Right or the Call Right and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by Stronghold Inc. as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments Stronghold Inc. makes under the TRA. Stronghold Inc. will retain the remaining net cash savings, if any. The TRA generally provides for payments to be made as Stronghold Inc. realizes actual cash tax savings from the tax benefits covered by the TRA. However, the TRA provides that if Stronghold Inc. elects to terminate the TRA early (or it is terminated early due to Stronghold Inc.'s failure to honor a material obligation thereunder or due to certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control), Stronghold Inc. is required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the future payments it would be required to make if it realized deemed tax savings pursuant to the TRA (determined by applying a discount rate equal to one-year LIBOR (or an agreed successor rate, if applicable) plus 100 basis points, and using numerous assumptions to determine deemed tax savings), and such early termination payment is expected to be substantial and may exceed the future tax benefits realized by Stronghold Inc.\nThe coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") global pandemic has resulted and is likely to continue to result in significant national and global economic disruption, which may adversely affect our business. Among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic\nWe operate as a market participant through PJM Interconnection, a Regional Transmission Organization ( RTO\u201d) that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity. We sell energy in the wholesale generation market in the PJM RTO. Energy revenues are delivered as a series of distinct units that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time and are therefore accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. The transaction price is based on pricing published in the day ahead market which constitute the stand-alone selling price.\nAs a result, general and administrative expenses were $8.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to $469.2 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The percentage of crypto asset segment revenues to the total segment revenues is increasing; thus a higher relative allocation of these shared costs. The majority of the $8.0 million was due to legal and professional fees, consulting startup costs, stock compensation expenses, as well as the execution of additional contracts to scale our legal structures and borrowing capabilities during this period. In addition, the payment of delinquent property taxes and the increases in insurance coverages and rates due to the purchase of a director and officer liability insurance policy, higher asset exposures, as well as higher rates in the risk markets.\nImpairments on digital currencies\nInterest expense of $(4.5) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from zero for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and was attributed to the required increased financing to purchase and ramp up both the miners and transformers operating bases. We have executed on a large number of hardware purchase and master equipment financing agreements that has provided both liquidity and the capability to scale the transformer and miner installation bases that generate our cryptocurrency mining revenues.\n2.The general availability of appropriate computer processing capacity on a global basis (commonly referred to in the industry as hashing capacity which is measured in petahash units); and\nIncluding $1.7 million from the Panther Creek Plant, operations and maintenance expenses increased by $11.1 million, or 336.8%, to approximately $14.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $3.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increases result from the required costs to properly support and maintain the Scrubgrass Plant versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. These costs include payroll, plant-related treatment, major maintenance and upgrade expenditures to get the Scrubgrass Plant to full capacity, and vehicles. Including approximately $1.8 million in major repairs and upgrades that were considered out of the ordinary. The relative amount of these costs, particularly payroll and major maintenance and upgrade expenditures, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, were comparatively small as the Scrubgrass Plant was just beginning to increase MW production after being dormant.\nBitmain\nNowlit Solutions Corp.\nOn March 3, 2021, Stronghold Digital Mining LLC ( SDM\u201d) entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Olympus Power, LLC (together with its affiliates, \"Olympus\") (the Olympus LOI\u201d) for the purchase of (i) the ownership interest in Scrubgrass Reclamation Company, L.P. (f/k/a Scrubgrass Generating Company, L.P.) ( Scrubgrass LP\u201d) held by Aspen Scrubgrass Participant, LLC (the Aspen Interest\u201d), (ii) the Panther Creek Plant, and (iii) the Third Plant.\nFair Value Measurements\nWhiteHawk Financing Agreement\nCryptech Purchase Agreement\nWe are not required to perform an impairment analysis (i.e., test the asset (group) for recoverability and potentially measure an impairment loss) if indicators of impairment are not present. We have assessed the need for an impairment write-down only if an indicator of impairment (e.g., a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset (group)) is present. Based on our analysis, no impairment indicators existed as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, that would require impairment testing of our long-lived assets.\nStronghold Inc. is a holding company with no operations and is the sole managing member of Stronghold LLC. Our principal asset consists of units of Stronghold LLC. Our earnings and cash flows and ability to meet any debt obligations will depend on the cash flows resulting from the operations of our operating subsidiaries, and the payment of distributions to us by such subsidiaries.\nCapacity Revenue\nBasic net (loss) income per share ( EPS\u201d) of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding or shares subject to exercise for a nominal value during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity.\nArctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement\nOur Board and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation, amortization, impairment, and realized gains and losses on sale of long-term assets) and other items (such as one-time transaction costs, expenses related to stock-based compensation, and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing our financial performance and results of operations across reporting periods by excluding items we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nOn January 31, 2022, we and NYDIG amended the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement (the NYDIG Amendment\u201d) to include (i) 2,140 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S+ miners and (ii) 2,140 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S miners we purchased pursuant to a purchase agreement dated December 16, 2021, totaling $12,622,816 of additional borrowing capacity. We will pay an aggregate closing fee of $504,912 to NYDIG. The NYDIG Amendment requires that we maintain a blocked wallet or other account for deposits of all Mined Currency.\nWe entered into a hardware purchase and sales agreement with Cryptech effective April 1, 2021. Hardware includes, but is not limited to, ASIC miners, power supply units, power distribution units and replacement fans for ASIC miners. Total purchase price is $12,660,000 for 2,400 BitmainS19j miners to be delivered monthly in equal quantities (200 per month) from November 2021 through October 2022. All hardware must be paid for in advance before it is shipped to us. We made a 30% down payment of $3,798,000 on April 1, 2021 with the remaining 70% or $8,862,000, agreed to be paid in 17 installments.\nAcquisitions\nAs we continue to acquire miners and utilize our power generating assets to power such miners, we anticipate that a great proportion of our revenue and expenses will relate to crypto asset mining.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.\nReactive energy power is provided to maintain a continuous voltage level. Revenue from reactive power is recognized ratably over time as we stand ready to provide it if called upon by the PJM RTO.\nCryptocurrency Mining\n\u2022Consideration payable to a customer\nOn December 31, 2021, we amended the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement (the WhiteHawk Amendment\u201d) to extend the final MinerVa delivery date from December 31, 2021 to April 30, 2022. Pursuant to the WhiteHawk Amendment, Equipment, LLC paid an amendment fee in the amount of $250,000 to WhiteHawk. On March 28, 2022, Equipment LLC and WhiteHawk again amended the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement (the \"Second WhiteHawk Amendment\") to\nIn order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606's definition of a distinct\u201d good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct), and the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\nEnergy revenue is recognized over time as energy volumes are generated and delivered to the RTO (which is contemporaneous with generation), using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of the performance obligation. We apply the invoice practical expedient in recognizing energy revenue. Under the invoice practical expedient, energy revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is considered equal to the value provided to the customer for our performance obligation completed to date.\nManagement has assessed the basis of depreciation of our cryptocurrency machines used to verify digital currency transactions and generate digital currencies and believes they should be depreciated over a two-year period. The rate at which we generate digital assets and, therefore, consume the economic benefits of our transaction verification servers, is influenced by a number of factors including the following:\nexchange the collateral under the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement. Pursuant to the Second WhiteHawk Amendment, (i) the approximately 11,700 remaining miners under the MinerVa Purchase Agreement will be exchanged as collateral for additional miners received by us from other suppliers and (ii) WhiteHawk agreed to lend to us an additional amount not exceed $25.0 million to finance certain previously purchased Bitcoin miners and related equipment (the \"Second Total Advance\"). Pursuant to the Second WhiteHawk Amendment, Equipment, LLC paid an amendment fee in the amount of $275,414.40 and a closing fee with respect to the Second Total Advance of $500,000. In addition to the purchased Bitcoin miners and related equipment, Panther Creek and Scrubgrass each agreed to a negative pledge of the Panther Creek Plant and Scrubgrass Plant, respectively, and guaranteed the WhiteHawk Finance Agreement. Each of the negative pledge and the guaranty by Panther Creek and Scrubgrass will be released upon payment in full of the Second Total Advance, regardless of whether the Total Advance remains outstanding. In conjunction with the Second WhiteHawk Amendment, we issued a warrant to WhiteHawk to purchase 125,000 shares of Class A common stock, subject to certain antidilution and other adjustment provisions as described in the warrant agreement, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the Second WhiteHawk Warrant\u201d). The Second WhiteHawk Warrant expires on March 28, 2032. While we continue to engage in discussions with MinerVa on the delivery of the remaining miners, we do not know when the remaining miners will be delivered, if at all.\nFor equity-classified awards, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period based on the computed fair value on the grant date of the award. Equity classified awards include the issuance of stock options and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d).\nIn accordance with guidance on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities all derivatives should be recognized at fair value. Derivatives or any portion thereof, that are not designated as, and effective as, hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. Derivative contracts are classified as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying combined balance sheets. Certain contracts that require physical delivery may qualify for and be designated as normal purchases/normal sales. Such contracts are accounted for on an accrual basis.\nDuring 2018 and 2019, we began providing Bitcoin mining services to third parties and also began operating our own Bitcoin mining equipment to generate Bitcoin, which we then exchange for U.S. Dollars. We have been expanding our mining operations since such date. As of December 31, 2021 we operated approximately 8,000 crypto asset mining computers (known as miners\u201d) with hash rate exceeding 0.8 EH/s. As of December 31, 2021 we had entered into definitive agreements with suppliers to purchase approximately 39,000 additional miners, including the remaining MinerVa Semiconductor Corp. (\"MinerVa\") miners that were not yet delivered at year end, with a total hash capacity equal to approximately 4.0 EH/s. We do not know when the remaining 11,700 MinerVa miners will be delivered, if at all. Additionally, we are evaluating all available remedies under the MinerVa Purchase Agreement (as defined herein). We intend to house our miners at the Scrubgrass Plant, the Panther Creek Plant, the Third Plant or other power assets that we identify.\nCryptocurrency Operations Segment\nOn April 1, 2021, we effected the corporate reorganization described in \"Note 1 - Business Combinations\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nBitmain Technologies Limited Purchase Agreement\nOperations and maintenance expenses increased by $1.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from zero for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase includes technicians now required to support multiple data centers and maintenance, as well as repairs and operating parts to maintain a larger base of miners.\nSupplier Purchase Agreements\n1.Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer\nOn July 9, 2021, Stronghold Digital Mining Holdings LLC ( Stronghold LLC\u201d) entered into a purchase agreement for the Panther Creek Plant (the Panther Creek Acquisition\u201d), as contemplated by the Olympus LOI, from Olympus. The Panther Creek Acquisition includes all of the assets of Panther Creek Power Operating LLC, comprised primarily of the Panther Creek Plant. The Panther Creek Plant is a coal refuse reclamation facility with 80 MW of net electricity generation capacity located near Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania. We completed the Panther Creek Acquisition on November 2, 2021. The consideration for the Panther Creek Plant was approximately $2.2 million ($3 million less $800 thousand in shared land closing costs) in cash and 1,152,000 Class A common units of Stronghold LLC ( Stronghold LLC Units\u201d), together with a corresponding number of shares of Class V common stock. Effective November 2, 2021, we closed on this acquisition. Refer to \"Note 25 - Acquisition\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted by the removal of one-time transaction costs, periodic impairment of digital currencies, realized gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets, expenses related to stock-based compensation, gains or losses on derivative contracts, gain on extinguishment of debt, realized gain or loss on sale of digital currencies, waste coal credits, commission on sale of ash, or changes in fair value of warrant liabilities in the period presented.\nNorthern Data\nWe entered into a hardware purchase and sales agreement with Nowlit Solutions Corp effective April 1, 2021. Hardware includes, but is not limited to, ASIC miners, power supply units, power distribution units and replacement fans for ASIC miners. All hardware must be paid for in advance before it is shipped to us. We made payments totaling $5,657,432 in April 2021 and costs have been capitalized and reported as property and equipment.\nSupplier Purchase Agreements\nOn December 10, 2021, we entered into a Hardware Purchase and Sale Agreement (the First Supplier Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire 3,000 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S miners (the M30S Miners\u201d) with a hash rate per unit of 87 TH/s. Pursuant to the First Supplier Purchase Agreement, the unit price per M30S Miner is $6,960 for a cumulative purchase price of $20,880,000 that was paid in full within five business days of the execution of the First Supplier Purchase Agreement.\n\u2022Noncash consideration\nWarrant Liabilities\nEnergy Generation\nOperations and maintenance\nWe paid for two separate purchases of miners from Nowlit Solutions Corp. The first purchase payment was made on November 23, 2021, in the amount of $1,605,360 for 190 miners. The second purchase payment was made on November 26, 2021, in the amount of $2,486,730 for an additional 295 miners.\nWe operate in an emerging industry for which limited data is available to make estimates of the useful economic lives of specialized equipment. Management has determined that two years best reflects the current expected useful life of transaction verification servers. This assessment takes into consideration the availability of historical data and management's expectations regarding the direction of the industry including potential changes in technology. Management will review this estimate annually and will revise such estimate as and when data becomes available.\nLuxor Technology Corporation\nOverview\nCryptocurrency Hosting\nOn October 28, 2021, we entered into the first of two Non-Fixed Price Sales and Purchase Agreement with Bitmain. This first agreement covers six batches of 2,000 miners, or 12,000 in total, arriving on a monthly basis from April through September 2022. Each batch has an assigned purchase price that totals to $75,000,000, to be paid in three installments of 25%, 35% and 40% over the six-month delivery period. Per the agreement, on October 29, 2021, the Company made a $23,300,000 payment comprised of the 25% installment payment plus 35% of the April 2022 batch of 2,000 miners that have an assigned purchase price of $13,000,000. On November 18, 2021, the Company made an additional payment of 35% or $4,550,000 towards the April 2022 batch of miners.\nReorganization\nEffective October 21, 2021, we entered into a director and officer insurance policy with annual premiums totaling $6.9 million. We have executed a Commercial Premium Finance Agreement with AFCO Premium Credit LLC over a term of nine months, with an annual interest rate of 3.454%, that finances the payment of the total premiums owed. The agreement requires a $1.4 million down payment, with the remaining $5.5 million plus interest paid over nine months. Monthly payments of $621.3 thousand started November 21, 2021 and end July 21, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the unpaid balance is $4.3 million.", "item_7_text": "\nOperating Expenses\nRevenue generated from crypto asset hosting increased by $2.0 million to $2.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. This increase was due to the continued expansion of generated power sales to crypto asset mining customers for which we are providing hosting services.\nCapacity\nCrypto asset hosting revenue\nOn November 30, 2021, we entered into a fourth purchase agreement with Luxor to acquire 400 Antminer T19 miners with a hash rate of 84 TH/s and 400 Antminer T19 miners with a hash rate of 88 terahash per second (\"TH/s\") for a total purchase price of $6,260,800.\nTrends and Other Factors Impacting Our Performance\nWe also use derivative instruments to mitigate the risks of bitcoin market pricing volatility. We entered into a variable prepaid forward sale contract that mitigates bitcoin market pricing volatility risks between a low and high collar of bitcoin market prices during the contract term. This contract settles in September 2022. The contract meets the definition of a derivative transaction pursuant to guidance under ASC 815 and is considered a compound derivative instrument which is required to be presented at fair value subject to remeasurement each reporting period. The changes in fair value is recorded as changes in fair value of forward sale derivative as part of earnings.\n1.The complexity of the transaction verification process which is driven by the algorithms contained within the Bitcoin open source software;\nOn December 7, 2021, we entered into a Hardware Purchase and Sales Agreement (the Cryptech Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Cryptech Solutions, Inc (\"Cryptech\") to acquire 1,000 Bitmain S19a miners (the Cryptech Miners\u201d) with a hash rate of 96 TH/s for a total purchase price of $8,592,000. Pursuant to the Cryptech Purchase Agreement, all hardware will be paid for in advance of being shipped to the Company.\nStronghold LLC is and has been organized as a pass through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is therefore not subject to entity-level U.S. federal income taxes. Stronghold Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on March 19, 2021 and therefore is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and state and local taxes at the prevailing corporate income tax rates, including with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of Stronghold LLC. In addition to tax expenses, Stronghold Inc. also incurs expenses related to its operations, plus payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement entered into between the Company, Q Power LLC ( Q Power\u201d) and an agent named by Q Power, dated April 1, 2021 (the TRA\u201d), which are expected to be significant. To the extent Stronghold LLC has available cash and subject to the terms of any current or future debt instruments, the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Stronghold LLC, as amended from time to time (the Stronghold LLC Agreement\u201d) requires Stronghold LLC to make pro rata cash distributions to holders of Stronghold LLC Units ( Stronghold Unit Holders\u201d), including Stronghold Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow Stronghold Inc. to pay its taxes and to make payments under the TRA. In addition, the Stronghold LLC Agreement requires Stronghold LLC to make non-pro rata payments to Stronghold Inc. to reimburse it for its corporate and other overhead expenses, which payments are not treated as distributions under the Stronghold LLC Agreement. See -Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d herein for additional information.\nOn December 15, 2021, we entered into the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement with NYDIG whereby NYDIG agreed to lend us up to $53,952,000 to finance the purchase of the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment. Outstanding borrowings under the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement are secured by the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment, contracts to acquire Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment, and the Bitcoin mined by the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment. The Second NYDIG Financing Agreement includes customary restrictions on additional liens on the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment. The Second NYDIG Financing Agreement may not be terminated by us or prepaid in whole or in part.\n(a)We do not allocate other income, net for segment reporting purposes. Amount is shown as a reconciling item between net operating income/(losses) and consolidated income before taxes. Refer to our consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 for further details.\nStronghold Inc. is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes as a corporation. Our accounting predecessor was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as such, was generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level. Rather, the tax liability with respect to its taxable income was passed through to its members. Accordingly, the financial data attributable to our predecessor contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality. Due to cumulative and current losses as well as an evaluation of other sources of income as outlined in ASC 740, management has determined that the utilization of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, and therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Management continues to evaluate the likelihood of the Company utilizing its deferred taxes, and while the valuation allowance remains in place, we expect to record no deferred income tax expense or benefit. Should the valuation allowance no longer be required, the 21% statutory federal income tax rate as well as state and local income taxes at their respective rates will apply to income allocated to Stronghold Inc., resulting in an estimated blended statutory rate of 28.89% of pre-tax earnings or losses attributable to the Company.\nDepreciation and amortization expense of $6.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from zero for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase is the result of the continued purchase of infrastructure assets and miners for the crypto asset operations driving a higher depreciable base for 2021. This ramp up has significantly accelerated starting in the second half of 2021.\nOperating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $(5.7) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $587.2 thousand of net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The $(5.7) million increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to increases in operations and G&A costs due to the expansions in energy production and the crypto asset mining operations, and significant increases in investments by holding digital currencies versus converting to cash equivalents in the spot markets. Those changes were partially offset by managing positive cash float with our trade payable vendors. The energy production was relatively dormant for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and crypto asset mining operations ramped up significantly starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 The end result of the dormant energy production, in 2020, did not require the relatively higher net operating cash outflows as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nOn April 14, 2021, we entered into an agreement with a supplier to provide approximately 9,900 miners for $21,011,287. We were required to make an initial payment on the miners that are currently being delivered starting in October 2021 (refer to \"Note 32 - Subsequent Events\" in the notes to our financial statements for further discussions). We made a 75% deposit of $15,758,432 in April 2021, and the remaining 25%, or $5,252,755 plus sales taxes has been invoiced in October 2021. Once operational, after deducting an amount equal to $0.027 per kWh for the actual power used, 65% of all cryptocurrency revenue generated by the miners in the supplier's pods shall be payable to us and 35% of all cryptocurrency revenue generated by the miners shall be payable to this party or its designee. As of December 31, 2021, there are no miners operating that will contractually obligate the Company to pay the 35% revenue share (refer to \"Note 32 - Subsequent Events\" in the notes to our financial statements for further discussions).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe are a vertically integrated crypto asset mining company currently focused on mining Bitcoin. We wholly own and operate two low-cost, environmentally-beneficial coal refuse power generation facilities that we have upgraded: (i) our first reclamation facility located on a 650-acre site in Scrubgrass Township, Venango County, Pennsylvania, which we acquired the remaining interest of in April 2021 and currently has the capacity to generate approximately 83.5 megawatts (\"MW\") of electricity (the \"Scrubgrass Plant\") and (ii) a facility located near Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania, which we acquired in November of 2021 and which has the capacity to generate approximately 80 MW of electricity (the \"Panther Creek Plant\"), each of which are recognized as an Alternative Energy System because coal refuse is classified under Pennsylvania law as a Tier II Alternative Energy Source (large-scale hydropower is also classified in this tier). We are committed to generating our energy and managing our assets sustainably, and we believe that we are one of the first vertically integrated crypto asset mining companies with a focus on environmentally beneficial operations. Owning our own source of power helps us to produce Bitcoin at one of the lowest prices among our publicly traded peers. We also believe that owning our own power source makes us a more attractive partner to crypto asset mining equipment purveyors. We completed our previously disclosed acquisition of a second coal refuse power generation facility and have entered into a non-binding letter of intent to purchase a third coal refuse power generation facility (the \"Third Plant\"). We intend to leverage these competitive advantages to continue to grow our business through the opportunistic acquisition of additional power generating assets and miners.\nThe below presents summarized results for our operations for the two reporting segments: Energy Operations and Cryptocurrency Operations.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, other income (expense) amounted to $(5.1) million of expense compared to $2.3 million of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense increased in 2021 to $4.6 million compared to $205.5 thousand in December 31, 2020. The increase in interest expense was driven by $(1.1) million from changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, and $(116.5) thousand from changes in fair value of forward sale derivatives. We did not have outstanding warrants for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as the equity offerings occurred as part of the reorganization on April 1, 2021, and the subsequent private placement funding. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we significantly improved our liquidity and capability to expand our power and mining assets through borrowings and master equipment financing agreements. As a result, the $(4.4) million increase in interest expenses, from this required financing, was realized so we could purchase miners and transformers to support the acceleration of the crypto asset ramp ups. Negative impacts of these increases are partially offset by the gains from the extinguishment of the $638.8 thousand PPP loan in January 2021. The prior comparable period, the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, benefited from the $1.2 million gains from closing out all derivatives (i.e. hedging positions), and $1.1 million in waste coal credits discussed above.\nCOVID-19 and Supply Chain Constraints\nScrubgrass Plant\n\u2022Constraining estimates of variable consideration\n\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral and administrative expenses include legal and professional fees, consulting costs, executive and support payroll, stock compensation expense, property taxes, insurance premiums related to coverages and rates, and management fees. The majority of general and administrative costs are allocated between the two segments using a fair-share\u201d of revenues approach, where the revenue for the segment is divided by the total combined revenues of the segments and is then multiplied by the shared general and administrative costs for the combined segments. Panther Creek G&A was $115.4 thousand.\nagreement with an affiliate of Arctos Credit, LLC ( Arctos,\u201d now known as NYDIG\u201d) (the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement. The aggregate principal outstanding bears interest of 10% and will be repaid in 24 monthly payments, with a 1.25% fee due if the Maximum Advance Amount is not requested prior to August 15, 2021. Outstanding borrowings under the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement are secured by certain miners and the contracts to acquire the such miners. The Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement includes customary restrictions on additional liens on the Arctos/NYDIG-Financed Equipment. As of September 30, 2021, $24.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) has been borrowed, leaving, approximately $10.3 million remaining available to be drawn under the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement. The Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement may not be terminated by us or prepaid in whole or in part. In conjunction with the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement, we issued 126,273 shares of Class A common stock to Arctos (adjusted for the Stock Split) and may issue additional shares of Class A common stock to Arctos in consideration of future financings.\nOperating expenses increased by $27.1 million, or 453.4%, to approximately $33.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $6.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nGeneral and administrative\nWe have entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts, as amended from time to time, with the mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and our enforceable right to compensation only begins when we provide computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, we are entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are recorded as a component of cost of revenues), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain. The terms of the agreement provide that neither party can dispute settlement terms after thirty-five days following settlement. Our fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power we contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe miners purchased pursuant to the two agreements with Bitmain will have an aggregate hash rate capacity of approximately 1,450 PH/s.\nWe provide capacity to a customer through participation in capacity auctions held by the PJM RTO. Capacity revenues are a series of distinct performance obligations that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time and are therefore accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. The transaction price for capacity is market-based and constitutes the stand-alone selling price. As capacity represents our stand-ready obligation, capacity revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied ratably over time, on a monthly basis, since we stand ready equally throughout the period to deliver power to the PJM RTO if called upon. We apply the invoice practical expedient in recognizing capacity revenue. Under the invoice practical expedient, capacity revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is considered equal to the value provided to the customer for our performance obligation completed to date. Penalties may be assessed by the PJM RTO against generation facilities if the facility is not available during the capacity period. The penalties assessed by the PJM RTO, if any, are recorded as a reduction to capacity revenue when incurred.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $294.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.4 million provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The significant increase of $292.8 million in cash provided by financing activities was a culmination of receiving $131.5 million in proceeds from the initial public offering (net of transaction fees) and $96.8 million (net of transaction fees) from our private placement equity raises of Series A Stock and Series B Stock. In addition, proceeds from the WhiteHawk Promissory Note of $39.1 million (net of debt issuance costs), as discussed in Note 14 - Stocks Issued Under Master Financing Agreements and Warrants,\" in the notes to our financial statements, $24.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) drawn against the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement (as defined below), discussed in \"Note 14 - Stocks Issued Under Master Financing Agreements and Warrants\" in the notes our financial statements; $17.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) received in advances from the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement as discussed in Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies\", the $7.0 million prepayment from the variable forward asset sales contract. This was partially offset by a $(2.0) million payoff of two related-party notes, $(2.0) million cash portion of the $(7.0) million buyout of the Aspen Interest, and (16.3) million in debt payments that are substantially related to the loans previously mentioned, and -$2.6 million paid on the financed insurance premium as discussed in Note 29 - Commercial Premium Financing Agreement. We received a second round PPP loan in March 2021 in the amount of $841.7 thousand. The first PPP loan received in May 2020 for $638.8 thousand was forgiven in January 2021. We are in the process of seeking forgiveness of our second PPP loan of $841.7 thousand. Additionally, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan received in June 2020 in the amount of $150.0 thousand was paid off on June 7, 2021.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $(257.0) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $(1.8) million used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The $(257.0) million net cash used in investing activities was attributable to the continued ramp up of the crypto asset segment. These investments require significant deposits by equipment vendors as commitments for future deliveries of miners, increasing the production bandwidths by building out our power and container infrastructures, and the implementation of any additional miners starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 into the full year ending 2021. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $490.0 thousand in acquired Panther Creek cash. The $(1.8) million in net cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December, 2020 includes $(2.0) million in construction in progress and miner acquisition costs due to the start of developing the power and mining infrastructure for future cryptocurrency miners.\nInterest Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses include legal and professional fees, consulting fees, stock compensation expenses, executive and support payroll, property taxes, insurance premiums related to coverages and rates, and management fees. The majority of general and administrative costs are allocated between the two segments using a fair-share\u201d of revenues approach, where the revenue for the segment is divided by the total combined revenues of the segments and is then multiplied by the shared general and administrative costs for the combined segments.\nIn May 2021, the Chinese government called for a crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading. Following this, the majority of Bitcoin miners in China were taken offline. This resulted in (i) a significant reduction in the Bitcoin global network hash rate, (ii) an increase in the availability of Bitcoin miners for purchase and (iii) an increase in the demand for power outside of China. Further, in September 2021, Chinese regulators instituted a blanket ban on all crypto mining and transactions, including overseas crypto exchange services taking place in China, effectively making all crypto-related activities illegal in China. The reduction in network hash rate has improved Bitcoin mining profitability, with plugged-in Bitcoin miners representing a larger percentage of the global hash rate. We do not believe that higher demand for power will have a negative impact on our business because we own and operate our power sources.\nCrypto asset mining revenue\nIncluding $5.8 million from the Panther Creek Plant, total operating expenses increased by $46.6 million or 714.2%; The increase in total operating expenses was partially attributable to increases of $12.8 million in fuel for the Scrubgrass Plant to produce higher MW capacity to provide power to the energy operations and cryptocurrency operations segments. The Scrubgrass Plant was relatively dormant for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, we experienced an increase of $12.2 million in operations and maintenance expenses related to the energy ramp-up requiring labor, vehicles, and major upgrades so the Scrubgrass Plant can be fully operational at the required higher capacities. Further, we had an increase of $12.7 million in general and administrative expenses due to legal and professional fees, consulting fees, stock compensation expenses, increased insurance costs, and compensation as we continue to organize and scale to a larger legal structure. Impairment costs of $1.9 million were attributed to the declines in the Bitcoin market pricing, primarily during the August 2021 to December 2021 timeframes. We also recorded $7.6 million in depreciation, an increase of approximately $7.0 million over the comparable period in 2020, due to the ramp-up of capital expenditures required for miners and transformers to grow the cryptocurrency hosting and mining infrastructures that produce increased hash rates.\nDerivative Contracts\nNYDIG ABL LLC Financing Agreement\n2.Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nOperations and maintenance\n5.Step 5: Recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation\nLoss per share\nOur historical financial results discussed below may not be comparable to our future financial results for the reasons described below.\nThe amount of income taxes we record requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, and local tax jurisdictions. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized after considering all positive and negative evidence available concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets.\nPost IPO Taxation and Public Company Costs\nOn November 16, 2021, we entered into a second agreement with Bitmain to purchase 1,800 miners, which will be delivered in six equal batches on a monthly basis beginning in July 2022 (the \"Second Bitmain Purchase Agreement\"). Per the Second Bitmain Purchase Agreement, on November 18, 2021, we made an initial payment of $6,835,000 to Bitmain for the miners. Subsequent payments will be made in the future in connection with additional deliveries of miners under the Second Bitmain Purchase Agreement.\n\nIncome Taxes\nWe rely on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), a non-GAAP (as defined below) key performance metric, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset (group) that is held and used must be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (group) might not be recoverable (i.e., information indicates that an impairment might exist). We are responsible for routinely assessing whether impairment indicators are present and should have systems or processes to assist in the identification of potential impairment indicators.\nAsset retirement obligations, including those conditioned on future events, are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset in the same period. In each subsequent period, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the EUL of the long-lived asset. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, we recognize a gain or loss on settlement. Our asset retirement obligation represents the cost we would incur to perform environmental clean-up or dismantle certain portions of the Facility.\nWe record notes payable net of any discounts or premiums. Discounts and premiums are amortized as interest expense or income over the life of the note in such a way as to result in a constant rate of interest when applied to the amount outstanding at the beginning of any given period.\ncash flows are impacted by the accounting policies the Company has adopted. In order to get a full understanding of the Company's financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed.\nExcept as otherwise indicated or required by the context, all references in this prospectus to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d relate to Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. ( Stronghold Inc.\u201d) and its consolidated subsidiaries following the Reorganization.\nOn October 28, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Bitmain Technologies Limited ( Bitmain\u201d) to purchase 12,000 miners, which will be delivered in six equal batches on a monthly basis beginning in April 2022 (the \"First Bitmain Purchase Agreement\"). Per the First Bitmain Purchase Agreement, on October 29, 2021, we made an initial payment of $23,300,000 to Bitmain for the miners, On November 18, 2021, we made an additional payment of $4,550,000. Subsequent payments will be made in the future in connection with additional deliveries of miners under the First Bitmain Purchase Agreement.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( Topic 842\u201d), which supersedes ASC Topic 840, Leases. Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. Topic 842 will be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. In November 2020, FASB deferred the effective date for implementation of Topic 842 by one year and, in June 2020, FASB deferred the effective date by an additional year. Beginning after December 15, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, the guidance under Topic 842 is effective. We are still in the process of developing our new accounting policies and determining the potential aggregate impact this guidance is likely to have on our financial statements as of its adoption date.\nWhen determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:\nIncluding $2.6 million from Panther Creek, fuel expense, after $(2.5) million in subsidized power costs from the crypto operations segment, increased by $10.4 million, or 3,278.4%, to approximately $10.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $316.0 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The subsidized power costs are for providing power to the crypto hosting and mining assets at a market price of $0.027 per kWh. The $10.4 million increase in fuel expenses compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to the continued expansions of energy production and the required coal, ash and limestone fuel purchases to generate energy to support the expansions. The fuel purchases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were very minimal as the Scrubgrass Plant was just starting to ramp up capacity, and both the crypto hosting and mining assets were relatively non-existent and did not purchase power from the Scrubgrass Plant.\n1 Includes the following non-recurring expenses: legal fees related to the Panther Creek Acquisition and the Northern Data Hosting Agreement, bad debt write-offs, startup costs related to initial crypto asset stores inventories, out-of-the-ordinary major repairs and upgrades to the power plant, and other one-time items.\nAs of the year ended December 31, 2021, we maintained a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance remains in place based on the uncertainty of future events, including the Company's ability to generate future taxable income in light of its recent losses, and management considered this and other factors in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Any changes in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if our deferred tax assets will be realized could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have no material off balance sheet arrangements.\nAs previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, stock-based compensation and business combinations. The Company's financial position, results of operations and\nTotal operating revenues increased by $12.6 million, or 357.2%, to $16.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, from $3.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Our Future Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations\nWe record warrant liabilities at their fair value as of the balance sheet date, and recognizes changes in the balances, over the comparative periods of either the issuance date or the last reporting date, as part of changes in fair value of warrant liabilities expense. At the issuance date, each series of warrants were convertible and redeemable to preferred stock.\nTwelve months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nTotal net obligations under all debt agreements as of December 31, 2021, including a second round PPP loan of $841.7 thousand, were $65.0 million.\nOn December 10, 2021, we entered into a Hardware Purchase and Sale Agreement (the First Supplier Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire 3,000 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S miners (the M30S Miners\u201d) with a hash rate per unit of 87 TH/s\u201d. Pursuant to the First Supplier Purchase Agreement, the unit price per M30S Miner is $6,960 for a cumulative purchase price of $20,880,000 that was paid in full within five business days of the execution of the First Supplier Purchase Agreement.\nmillion from hosting and an increase of $12.2 million from mining. The growth in the crypto asset mining revenue is the result of the significant ramp up of miner and transformer installations during the second half of 2021.\nOn November 2, 2021, we entered into the Operations, Maintenance and Ancillary Services Agreement (the Omnibus Services Agreement\u201d) with Olympus Stronghold Services, LLC ( Olympus Stronghold Services\u201d), whereby Olympus Stronghold Services will provide certain operations and maintenance services to Stronghold LLC, as well as employ certain personnel to operate the Panther Creek Plant and the Scrubgrass Plant. Stronghold LLC will reimburse Olympus Stronghold Services for those costs incurred by Olympus Stronghold Services and approved by Stronghold LLC in the course of providing services under the Omnibus Services Agreement, including payroll and benefits costs and insurance costs. The material costs incurred by Olympus Stronghold Services shall be approved by Stronghold LLC. Stronghold LLC will also pay Olympus Stronghold Services a management fee at the rate of $1,000,000 per year, payable monthly, and an additional one-time mobilization fee of $150,000 upon the effective date of the Omnibus Services Agreement. Refer to \"Note 9 - Related Party Transactions\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nOperating Expenses\nStock Based Compensation\nBitcoin Mining Growth\nFair value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt. There is currently no specific definitive guidance under GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for cryptocurrencies recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the FASB, we may be required to change our policies, which could have an effect on our consolidated financial position and results from operations.\nOur cash needs are primarily for growth through acquisitions and working capital to support equipment financing and the purchase of additional miners. We have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses in servicing and maintaining our power generation facilities. If we were to acquire additional facilities in the future, capital expenditures may include improvements, maintenance, and buildout costs associated with enabling such facilities to house miners to mine Bitcoin.\nCryptech Solutions Purchase Agreement\nOperating expenses increased to $19.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $542.9 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There were minimal hosting customers and a very insignificant hash rate output due to a small number of miners for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, resulting in very small costs to operate. Of the $19.7 million in operating expenses, approximately 32.0% are attributed to depreciation and amortization relative to the ramping up of our cryptocurrency miner assets that have two year useful lives; whereas 40.4% of the $19.7 million operating expenses are general and administrative expenses that includes stock compensation expenses, and startup costs related to legal and consulting.\nIf a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.\nOn June 30, 2021, we entered into an equipment financing agreement (the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement\u201d) with WhiteHawk Finance LLC (\"Whitehawk\") whereby WhiteHawk agreed to lend to us an aggregate amount not to exceed $40.0 million (the Total Advance\u201d) to finance the purchase of certain Bitcoin miners and related equipment (the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment\u201d). At August 30, 2021, the entirety of the Total Advance was drawn under the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement. The aggregate principal outstanding bears interest of 10% and will be repaid in 24 monthly payments. Outstanding borrowings under the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement are secured by the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment and the contracts to acquire the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment. The WhiteHawk Financing Agreement includes customary restrictions on additional liens on the WhiteHawk-Financed Equipment and is guaranteed by the Company. The WhiteHawk Financing Agreement may be terminated early if we, among other things, pay the Early Termination Fee (as defined therein). In conjunction with the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement, we issued a stock purchase warrant to WhiteHawk, which provides for the purchase of a number of shares of Class A common stock at $0.01 per share, equal to approximately $2.0 million, subject to adjustment as described in the warrant agreement (the WhiteHawk Warrant\u201d). The WhiteHawk Warrant expires on June 30, 2031.\nWe recognize revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of this revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\nAs we further implement controls, processes and infrastructure applicable to companies with publicly traded equity securities, it is likely that we will incur additional selling, general and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses relative to historical periods. Our future results will depend on our ability to efficiently manage our combined operations and execute our business strategy.\nCryptocurrency Machines\nWe have entered into customer hosting contracts whereby we provide electrical power to cryptocurrency mining customers, and the customers pay a stated amount per MWh ( Contract Capacity\u201d). This amount is paid monthly in advance. Amounts used in excess of the Contract Capacity are billed based upon calculated formulas as contained in the contracts. If any shortfalls occur due to outages, make-whole payment provisions contained in the contracts are used to offset the billings to the customer which prevented them from cryptocurrency mining. Advanced payments and customer deposits are reflected as contract liabilities.\nEquipment Purchase and Financing Transactions\nIncluding $3.1 million from the Panther Creek Plant, revenue from the generation of energy increased by $11.4 million, or 2,189.9%, to approximately $11.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $518.4 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was the result of the plant energy production no longer remaining relatively dormant as was the case during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Full plant power utilization is optimal for our revenue growth as it also drives a higher volume of Tier II Renewable Energy Credits (\"RECs\"), waste coal tax credits, and beneficial use ash sales, as well as the increased power bandwidths for the crypto asset operations.\nOn June 25, 2021, we entered into a $34,481,700 (\"Maximum Advance Amount\") master equipment financing\nOur board of directors (the Board\u201d) and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation, amortization, impairment, and realized gains and losses on sale of long-term assets) and other items (such as one-time transaction costs, expenses related to stock-based compensation, and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts)\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted by the removal of one-time transaction costs, periodic impairment of digital currencies, realized gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets, expenses related to stock-based compensation, gains or losses on derivative contracts, gain on extinguishment of debt, realized gain or loss on sale of digital currencies, waste coal credits, commission on sale of ash, or changes in fair value of warrant liabilities in the period presented.\nHighlights of our consolidated results of operations for twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 include the effect of the Panther Creek Acquisition (refer to Note 25 - Acquisitions\" in notes to our financial statements) that closed on November 2, 2021. The Panther Creek Plant operates as part of our Energy Segment.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes Between the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nKey Performance Metrics\nNYDIG ABL LLC\n2021 Highlights\ndetermined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, stock-based compensation and business combinations. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies we have adopted. In order to get a full understanding of our financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed.\nWe paid for three separate purchases of miners from Luxor. The first purchase payment was made on November 26, 2021, in the amount of $4,312,650 for 770 miners. The second and third purchase payments were made on November 29, 2021, in the amount of $5,357,300 and $3,633,500 respectively; for an additional 750 and 500 miners.\nOn December 16, 2021, we entered into a Second Hardware Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Second Supplier Purchase Agreement\") to acquire a cumulative amount of approximately 4,280 M30S Miners and MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S+ miners with a hash rate per unit of 100 TH/s (the M30S+ Miners\u201d). Pursuant to the Second Supplier Purchase Agreement, the unit price per M30S Miner is $2,714 and the unit price per M30S+ Miner is $3,520 for a cumulative purchase price of $11,340,373.\nTwo draws against the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement totaled $17.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) secured by our equipment contract commitments for future miner deliveries. As of December 31, 2021, the amount owed under the debt agreements totaled $17.2 million with repayment terms extending through December 2023. Of the total amount outstanding of $17.2 million, $13.8 million was classified as current portion of long-term debt (less discounts and debt issuance costs) and will be repaid as of December 15, 2023. The remaining portion of long-term debt is $3.4 million (less discounts and debt issuance costs). As of December 31, 2021, the monthly repayment amounts, including interest, totaled $18.6 million. For additional information, see Note 6 - Long-Term Debt\u201d in the notes to our financial statements.\nWe have historically relied on funds from equity issuances, equipment financings, and revenue from sales of Bitcoin and power generated at our power plants to provide for our liquidity needs. During 2021, we received $63.2 million (net of loan fees and debt issuance costs) in proceeds from the financing agreements with WhiteHawk and NYDIG, net proceeds of $131.5 million from the IPO and net proceeds of $96.8 million from two private placements of convertible preferred securities. Additionally, on March 28, 2022, we received an additional $25.0 million from WhiteHawk as a result of the Second WhiteHawk Amendment. Please see -Debt Agreements - Equipment Purchase and Financing Transactions\u201d for more information regarding our financing arrangements. These cash sources provided additional short and long-term liquidity to support our operations in fiscal year 2021 and through the first quarter of 2022. Taking into account the Second WhiteHawk Amendment and other sources of capital, such as proceeds from asset sales or additional sources of debt or equity financing, to which we believe we have access, we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next twelve months. We anticipate also that we will need additional sources of capital and will need to increase our cash flow from operations and financing activities for our long-term capital needs including to fund our business plan and to meet our long-term operating requirements. We may sell assets or seek potential additional debt or equity financing to fund our short-term and long-term needs. If we are unable to ramp up our Bitcoin mining efforts and raise additional capital, there is a risk that we could default on our obligations and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of our operations, including through the sale of our assets, if no other means of financing options are available. As of December 31, 2021 and March 24, 2022, we had 182 and 344 Bitcoins on hand, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and March 28, 2022, we had approximately $39.5 million and approximately $32 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and March 28, 2022, we had outstanding indebtedness of $68.5 million and $117.8 million, respectively, and availability under our financing agreements of $35.4 million and $18.0 million, respectively.\nWe completed the issuance and sale of our Class A common stock, par value $.0001 per share, in an initial public offering (the \"IPO\") on October 22, 2021, and our Class A common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol SDIG.\u201d Refer to \"Note 27 - Initial Public Offering\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nthat impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing our financial performance and results of operations across reporting periods by excluding items we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nTo the extent that any of the assumptions underlying management's estimate of useful life of its transaction verification servers are subject to revision in a future reporting period either as a result of changes in circumstances or through the availability of greater quantities of data then the estimated useful life could change and have a prospective impact on depreciation expense and the carrying amounts of these assets.\nAs an emerging growth company\u201d ( EGC\u201d), the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ( JOBS Act\u201d) allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. The adoption dates discussed below reflect this election.\nThe cryptocurrency operations segment purchases power from the Scrubgrass Plant at $0.027 per kWh to provide power to both the hosted customer and Bitcoin mining equipment. The $2.4 million increase compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to the continued expansions of these assets and customer strategy, as discussed previously, starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 with significant ramp up starting in the second half of 2021.\nThe crypto spot market is volatile and can have a negative impact on the mark-to-market of our digital currencies as of the ending balance sheet reporting date. As a result, a $1.9 million impairment charge was recognized as a result of the negative impacts from the crypto coin spot market declines against the held crypto coin inventories not yet converted to cash. As of December 31, 2021, the Company held on its balance sheet approximately 182 Bitcoin and the spot market price of Bitcoin was $47,686.81 per Coinbase Global Inc.\nWe paid for three separate purchases of miners from Luxor Technology Corporation (\"Luxor\"). The first purchase payment was made on November 26, 2021, in the amount of $4,312,650 for 770 miners. The second and third purchase payments were made on November 29, 2021, in the amount of $5,357,300 and $3,633,500 respectively, for an additional 750 and 500 miners.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, incremental, non-recurring costs related to our transition to a publicly traded corporation, including the costs of the IPO and the costs associated with the initial implementation of our internal control reviews and testing pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"). We have also incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional significant and recurring expenses as a publicly traded corporation, including costs associated with compliance under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, annual and quarterly reports to common stockholders, registrar and transfer agent fees, national stock exchange fees, audit fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and director and officer compensation. Our financial statements following the IPO will continue to reflect the impact of these expenses.\nAs a result, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.9 million, or 270.8%, to approximately $6.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $1.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The cryptocurrency operations segment revenue was minimal for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, so the energy operations segment realized large portion of the general and administrative costs during this time. The majority of the $4.9 million increase was due to legal and professional fees, consulting startup costs, stock compensation expenses, as well as the execution of additional contracts to scale our legal structures and borrowing capabilities during this period. In addition, the payment of delinquent property taxes and the increases in insurance coverages and rates due to the purchase of a director and officer liability insurance policy, higher asset exposures, as well as higher rates in the risk markets contributed to the increase.\nNotes Payable\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing into 2022, the Scrubgrass Plant had downtime that was greater than anticipated, driven largely by mechanical failures. The upgrades and maintenance that are necessary have taken longer and are more extensive than originally anticipated. We expect these investments to be completed in the second half of 2022. Once finished, the Scrubgrass Plant is expected to be operational at nameplate capacity with high uptime and low operating costs.\n\u2022The existence of a significant financing component in the contract\nEnergy Operations Segment\nconsummate a change of control or reduce the proceeds received by our stockholders in connection with a change of control. However, Stronghold Inc. may be required to fund such payment from other sources, and as a result, any early termination of the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity or financial condition.\n\nTotal operating revenues increased by $14.2 million, or 2,399.2%, to $14.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, from $591.9 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nRevenue generated from crypto asset mining increased by $12.2 million, or 3,580.8%, to approximately $12.49 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $339.5 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of the significant purchases of miners and transformers, with the expansions that started during the fourth quarter of 2020 through the end of 2021. The deployments of these miners and transformers are significantly increasing total hash rates and Bitcoin awards.\nFair value of the digital asset award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt.\nVariable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate. There were no revenue streams with variable consideration during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nOn November 30, 2021, we entered into a fourth purchase agreement with Luxor to acquire 400 Antminer T19 miners with a hash rate of 84 TH/s and 400 Antminer T19 miners with a hash rate of 88 TH/s for a total purchase price of $6,260,800.\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and\nInterest Expense\nOn November 16, 2021, we entered into the second Non-Fixed Price Sales and Purchase Agreement with Bitmain. This second agreement covers six batches of 300 miners, or 1,800 in total, arriving on a monthly basis from July 2022 through December 2022. Each batch has an assigned purchase price that totals $19,350,000, to be paid in three installments of 35%, 35%, and 30% of the total purchase price over the six month delivery period. Per the second Non-Fixed Price Sales and Purchase Agreement, on November 18, 2021, the Company paid the first installment payment of 35% or $6,835,000.\nConsolidated Results- for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nThere is currently no specific definitive guidance under GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for cryptocurrencies recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), we may be required to change our policies, which could have an effect on our condensed consolidated financial position and results from operations.\nChina's Crackdown on Bitcoin Mining\nComparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nadditional 2,675 miners at cost of $37.5 per terahash (to be paid five months after delivery) and temporarily reduced the profit share for Northern Data while incorporating performance thresholds until the data center build-out is complete. Refer to \"Note 28 - Hosting Services Agreement\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nOn August 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Northern Data PA, LLC ( Northern Data\u201d) whereby Northern Data will construct and operate a colocation datacenter facility located on the Scrubgrass Plant (the Hosting Agreement\u201d), the primary business purpose of which will be to provide hosting services and support the cryptocurrency miners that we have purchased but not yet received entirely. On March 28, 2022, we restructured the Hosting Agreement to obtain an\nOn December 15, 2021, we entered into a Master Equipment Finance Agreement (the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement\u201d) with NYDIG ABL LLC ( NYDIG\u201d) whereby NYDIG agreed to lend Stronghold Digital Mining BT, LLC (\"Digital Mining BT\") up to $53,952,000 to finance the purchase of certain Bitcoin miners and related equipment (the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment\u201d). Outstanding borrowings under the Second NYDIG Financing Agreement are secured by the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment, contracts to acquire Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment, and the Bitcoin mined by the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment. The Second NYDIG Financing Agreement includes customary restrictions on additional liens on the Second NYDIG-Financed Equipment. The NYDIG Second Financing Agreement may not be terminated by Digital Mining BT or prepaid in whole or in part. Refer to \"Note 6 - Long-Term Debt\" and \"Note 32 - Subsequent Events\" in our notes to our financial statements.\nThe accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management. These assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change. Material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the potential for income tax audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters.\n3.Technological obsolescence reflecting rapid development in the transaction verification server industry such that more recently developed hardware is more economically efficient to run in terms of digital assets generated as a function of operating costs, primarily power costs, (i.e., the speed of hardware evolution in the industry is such that later hardware models generally have faster processing capacity combined with lower operating costs and a lower cost of purchase).\nWith the full deployment of these new miners, including the remaining 11,700 MinerVa miners, which we do not know when they will be delivered, if at all, our total fleet is currently expected to comprise approximately 57,000 total miners by December 2022 and consume approximately 200 MW of electricity.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nThe majority of the depreciation and amortization expense that marginally increased by $746.8 thousand, or 133.7%, to approximately $1.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, from $558.6 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was due to $732.1 thousand from Panther Creek.\nWe effected 2.88-for-1 stock split on October 22, 2021, pursuant to which each share of common stock held of record by the holder thereof was reclassified into approximately 2.88 shares of common stock. No fractional shares were issued. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Stronghold LLC, as amended from time to time, each Stronghold LLC Unit was also split on a corresponding 2.88-for-1 basis, such that there are an equivalent number of Stronghold LLC Units outstanding as the aggregate number of shares of Class V common stock and Class A common stock outstanding following the stock split. We refer to this collectively as the Stock Split.\u201d\nInitial Public Offering\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nWe measure at fair value certain of our financial and non-financial assets and liabilities by using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially an exit price, based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\nAs of January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted Topic 606 under the modified retrospective approach whereby the cumulative effect of adopting the new guidance was recognized on the date of initial application. The adoption of ASC 606 did not result in a change to the accounting for revenue, as such, no cumulative effect adjustment was recorded.\nIncluding $3.8 million from the Panther Creek Plant, total revenue from all segments increased by $26.8 million, or 650.7%, to approximately $30.9 million primarily driven by large increases in both the energy and crypto asset mining revenues. Energy generation and the continued ramp up to full MW capacity contributed to approximately $11.4 million or 2189.9%. Additionally, total crypto asset revenue growth of approximately $14.2 million included approximately $2.0\nFuel - purchased from energy segment\nWe also entered into two additional separate purchases of miners from Nowlit Solutions Corp. The first purchase payment was made on November 23, 2021, in the amount of $1,605,360 for 190 miners. The second purchase payment was made on November 26, 2021, in the amount of $2,486,730 for an additional 295 miners.\nNowlit Solutions Corp Purchase Agreement\nWe continue to evaluate the acquisition of the Third Plant as contemplated by the Olympus LOI, although the acquisition of the Third Plant is subject to further due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement, and there is no assurance that the acquisition will be completed. The acquisition of the Third Plant is subject to further due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement, and there is no assurance that the acquisition will be completed. The consideration for the Third Plant is expected to be approximately $3.0 million in cash and 6,250,000 of Stronghold LLC Units, together with a corresponding number of shares of Class V common stock. If acquired, we plan to store newly acquired miners at or near the Third Plant and use power generated by the Third Plant to power crypto asset mining operations in an environmentally conscious manner. We are also strategically pursuing acquisitions of additional assets.\nInterest expense decreased by $124.6 thousand, or (60.6)%, to $(80.9) thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $(205.5) thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as loans were either paid off or later in their terms with lower interest portions of their payments. Panther Creek had marginal impacts to Interest Expense.\nSegment Results\n3.Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n\u2022Variable consideration\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDepreciation and Amortization\nCash Flows\nOur policies with respect to our revenue streams are detailed below.\n\nDebt Agreements\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans, expectations and strategy for our business, and operations, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see section above entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risks may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion and analysis. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those described under the heading Risk Factors\u201d and discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n4.Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nOn December 16, 2021, we entered into a Second Hardware Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Second Supplier Purchase Agreement\") to acquire a cumulative amount of approximately 4,280 M30S Miners and MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S+ miners with a hash rate per unit of 100 TH/s (the M30S+ Miners\u201d). Pursuant to the Second Supplier Purchase Agreement, the unit price per M30S Miner is $2,714 and the unit price per M30S+ Miner is $3,520 for a cumulative purchase price of $11,340,373.\nWe entered into the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement on June 30, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the amount owed under the debt agreements totaled $40.7 million with repayment terms extending through June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, the monthly repayment amounts, including interest, total 30.7 million. For additional information, see Note 6 - Long-Term Debt\u201d in the notes to our financial statements.\nWe have not yet established a consistent, ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs, and we incurred a net loss of $27.3 million in fiscal 2021 and an accumulated deficit of $338.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The losses incurred in recent years, with the associated substantial accumulated deficit, are a result of our Bitcoin mining ramp-up, which is a capital intensive industry. We experienced a number of setbacks and unexpected challenges, including a longer-than-expected delay of the MinerVa miners and longer than expected downtime at our Scrubgrass Plant for maintenance. As a result of the delay in delivery of the MinerVa miners, we were at risk of defaulting on our obligations under the WhiteHawk debt facility because those miners were to be provided as collateral to WhiteHawk by April 30, 2022. We spent approximately $5.1 million in fiscal year 2021 on maintenance and repair costs at the Scrubgrass Plant, and we estimate that we will spend an aggregate of $30 million on total repair and maintenance cost in fiscal 2022. In addition to incurred expenses, we are also unable to mine Bitcoin at the Scrubgrass Plant during such downtime, which directly and negatively affects our results of operations. Due to these and the other operational setbacks discussed herein, we estimate that such factors have negatively impacted our cash on hand by approximately $40 million to $45 million as of March 24, 2022 compared to if miners had been delivered in accordance with the original delivery schedules under purchase agreements and the Scrubgrass Plant's uptime was as expected. As a result of these events, we faced a significant liquidity shortfall that reduced our cash position to approximately $3 million on March 28, 2022, with available funding of another $18 million. In response, we sought and obtained the Second WhiteHawk Amendment to substitute collateral, avoid an event of default, and obtain additional funding to address our near-term liquidity needs. We believe our liquidity position, combined with expected operating cash flow and the proceeds of additional debt or equity financings or asset sales, will be sufficient to meet our existing commitments and fund our operations for the next twelve months.\n\nOn April 2, 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement with MinerVa for the acquisition of 15,000 of their MV7 ASIC SHA256 model cryptocurrency miner equipment (miners) with a total terahash to be delivered equal to 1.5 million terahash. The price per miner is $4,892.50 for an aggregate purchase price of $73,387,500 to be paid in installments. The first installment of 60% of the purchase price, or $44,032,500, was paid on April 2, 2021, and an additional payment of 20% of the purchase price, or $14,677,500, was paid on June 2, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, there are no remaining deposits owed. In December 2021, we extended the deadline for delivery of the MinerVa miners to April 2022. In March 2022, MinerVa was again unable to meet its delivery date and has only delivered approximately 3,200 of the 15,000 miners. We do not know when the remaining MinerVa miners will be received, if at all. As a result, we may write off some or all of the approximately 11,700 undelivered MinerVa miners. MinerVa continues to tell us that MinerVa anticipates shipping no less than 15,000 miners by April 2022. Refer to Note 30 - Covenants that describe covenants referencing the anticipated final delivery timeframe of April 2022. Please see \"Note 32 - Subsequent Events\" in the notes to our financial statements for further disclosure on payment of the remaining 20%. In exchange for the delivery of the miners that are operating under the specifications set forth in the purchase agreement, we will grant the seller 443,848 shares of our Class A common stock at a price per share of $8.68 (adjusted for the Stock Split). The aggregate purchase price does not include shipping costs, which are our responsibility and shall be determined at which time the miners are ready for shipment.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nLuxor Technology Corporation Purchase Agreement\nIncluding $681.7 thousand from the Panther Creek Plant, revenue generated from capacity increased by $1.4 million, or 50.5%, to approximately $4.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $2.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of the successful ramp up of MW capacity in 2021; coupled with higher pricing per kilowatt hour (\"kWh\") on the higher capacity usages.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity's own assumptions.\nOperating Revenues\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.

Pursuant to the Cryptech Purchase Agreement, all hardware will be paid for in advance of being shipped to the Company.\nA financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nA summary of our critical accounting policies follows:\nOverview\nTwo draws against the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement (as defined below) totaled $24.2 million (net of debt issuance costs) secured by our equipment contract commitments for future miner deliveries. As of December 31, 2021, the amount owed under the debt agreements totaled $21.9 million with repayment terms extending through July 25, 2023. Of the total amount outstanding of $21.9 million, $12.0 million was classified as current portion of long-term debt (less discounts and debt issuance costs) and will be repaid as of July 25, 2023. The remaining portion of long-term debt is $9.9 million (less discounts and debt issuance costs). As of December 31, 2021, the monthly repayment amounts, including interest, totaled $19.0 million. For additional information, see Note 6 - Long-Term Debt\u201d in the notes to our financial statements.\nWe have entered into various debt agreements used to purchase equipment to operate our business.\nEnergy Revenue\nhas caused supply chain disruptions that may have lasting impacts. Additionally, the global supply chain for Bitcoin miners is presently further constrained due to unprecedented demand coupled with a global shortage of mining equipment and mining equipment parts. Based on our current assessments, however, we do not expect any material impact on long-term development, operations, or liquidity due to the spread of COVID-19. However, we are actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, and industry.\n\nThe miners purchased pursuant to the two agreements with Bitmain will have an aggregate hash rate capacity of approximately 1,450 PH/s.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nGeneral and administrative\nProviding computing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of our ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in our contracts with mining pool operators. The transaction consideration we receive, if any, is noncash consideration, which we measure at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time we have earned the award from the pools. The consideration is all variable. Because it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur, the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and we receive confirmation of the consideration we will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.\nFuel - net of crypto segment subsidy\nThe actual timing and amount of any payments that may be made under the TRA are unknown at this time and will vary based on a number of factors. However, Stronghold Inc. expects that the payments that it will be required to make to Q Power (or its permitted assignees) in connection with the TRA will be substantial. Any payments made by Stronghold Inc. to Q Power (or its permitted assignees) under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of cash that might have otherwise been available to Stronghold Inc. or Stronghold LLC. To the extent Stronghold LLC has available cash and subject to the terms of any current or future debt or other agreements, the Stronghold LLC Agreement will require Stronghold LLC to make pro rata cash distributions to holders of Stronghold LLC Units, including Stronghold Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow Stronghold Inc. to pay its taxes and to make payments under the TRA. Stronghold Inc. generally expects Stronghold LLC to fund such distributions out of available cash. However, except in cases where Stronghold Inc. elects to terminate the TRA early, the TRA is terminated early due to certain mergers or other changes of control or Stronghold Inc. has available cash but fails to make payments when due, generally Stronghold Inc. may defer payments due under the TRA if it does not have available cash to satisfy its payment obligations under the TRA or if its contractual obligations limit its ability to make these payments. Any such deferred payments under the TRA generally will accrue interest at the rate provided for in the TRA, and such interest may significantly exceed Stronghold Inc.'s other costs of capital. If Stronghold Inc. experiences a change of control (as defined under the TRA, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations), and in certain other circumstances, payments under the TRA may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, Stronghold Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA. In the case of such an acceleration in connection with a change of control, where applicable, Stronghold Inc. generally expects the accelerated payments due under the TRA to be funded out of the proceeds of the change of control transaction giving rise to such acceleration, which could have a significant impact on our ability to\nThe TRA generally provides for the payment by Stronghold Inc. to certain of the Stronghold Unit Holders of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax (computed using the estimated impact of state and local taxes) that Stronghold Inc. actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) certain increases in tax basis that occur as a result of Stronghold Inc.'s acquisition (or deemed acquisition for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of all or a portion of such holder's Stronghold LLC Units pursuant to an exercise of Redemption Right or the Call Right and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by Stronghold Inc. as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments Stronghold Inc. makes under the TRA. Stronghold Inc. will retain the remaining net cash savings, if any. The TRA generally provides for payments to be made as Stronghold Inc. realizes actual cash tax savings from the tax benefits covered by the TRA. However, the TRA provides that if Stronghold Inc. elects to terminate the TRA early (or it is terminated early due to Stronghold Inc.'s failure to honor a material obligation thereunder or due to certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control), Stronghold Inc. is required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the future payments it would be required to make if it realized deemed tax savings pursuant to the TRA (determined by applying a discount rate equal to one-year LIBOR (or an agreed successor rate, if applicable) plus 100 basis points, and using numerous assumptions to determine deemed tax savings), and such early termination payment is expected to be substantial and may exceed the future tax benefits realized by Stronghold Inc.\nThe coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") global pandemic has resulted and is likely to continue to result in significant national and global economic disruption, which may adversely affect our business. Among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic\nWe operate as a market participant through PJM Interconnection, a Regional Transmission Organization ( RTO\u201d) that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity. We sell energy in the wholesale generation market in the PJM RTO. Energy revenues are delivered as a series of distinct units that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time and are therefore accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. The transaction price is based on pricing published in the day ahead market which constitute the stand-alone selling price.\nAs a result, general and administrative expenses were $8.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to $469.2 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The percentage of crypto asset segment revenues to the total segment revenues is increasing; thus a higher relative allocation of these shared costs. The majority of the $8.0 million was due to legal and professional fees, consulting startup costs, stock compensation expenses, as well as the execution of additional contracts to scale our legal structures and borrowing capabilities during this period. In addition, the payment of delinquent property taxes and the increases in insurance coverages and rates due to the purchase of a director and officer liability insurance policy, higher asset exposures, as well as higher rates in the risk markets.\nImpairments on digital currencies\nInterest expense of $(4.5) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from zero for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and was attributed to the required increased financing to purchase and ramp up both the miners and transformers operating bases. We have executed on a large number of hardware purchase and master equipment financing agreements that has provided both liquidity and the capability to scale the transformer and miner installation bases that generate our cryptocurrency mining revenues.\n2.The general availability of appropriate computer processing capacity on a global basis (commonly referred to in the industry as hashing capacity which is measured in petahash units); and\nIncluding $1.7 million from the Panther Creek Plant, operations and maintenance expenses increased by $11.1 million, or 336.8%, to approximately $14.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $3.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increases result from the required costs to properly support and maintain the Scrubgrass Plant versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. These costs include payroll, plant-related treatment, major maintenance and upgrade expenditures to get the Scrubgrass Plant to full capacity, and vehicles. Including approximately $1.8 million in major repairs and upgrades that were considered out of the ordinary. The relative amount of these costs, particularly payroll and major maintenance and upgrade expenditures, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, were comparatively small as the Scrubgrass Plant was just beginning to increase MW production after being dormant.\nBitmain\nNowlit Solutions Corp.\nOn March 3, 2021, Stronghold Digital Mining LLC ( SDM\u201d) entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Olympus Power, LLC (together with its affiliates, \"Olympus\") (the Olympus LOI\u201d) for the purchase of (i) the ownership interest in Scrubgrass Reclamation Company, L.P. (f/k/a Scrubgrass Generating Company, L.P.) ( Scrubgrass LP\u201d) held by Aspen Scrubgrass Participant, LLC (the Aspen Interest\u201d), (ii) the Panther Creek Plant, and (iii) the Third Plant.\nFair Value Measurements\nWhiteHawk Financing Agreement\nCryptech Purchase Agreement\nWe are not required to perform an impairment analysis (i.e., test the asset (group) for recoverability and potentially measure an impairment loss) if indicators of impairment are not present. We have assessed the need for an impairment write-down only if an indicator of impairment (e.g., a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset (group)) is present. Based on our analysis, no impairment indicators existed as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, that would require impairment testing of our long-lived assets.\nStronghold Inc. is a holding company with no operations and is the sole managing member of Stronghold LLC. Our principal asset consists of units of Stronghold LLC. Our earnings and cash flows and ability to meet any debt obligations will depend on the cash flows resulting from the operations of our operating subsidiaries, and the payment of distributions to us by such subsidiaries.\nCapacity Revenue\nBasic net (loss) income per share ( EPS\u201d) of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding or shares subject to exercise for a nominal value during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity.\nArctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement\nOur Board and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation, amortization, impairment, and realized gains and losses on sale of long-term assets) and other items (such as one-time transaction costs, expenses related to stock-based compensation, and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing our financial performance and results of operations across reporting periods by excluding items we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nOn January 31, 2022, we and NYDIG amended the Arctos/NYDIG Financing Agreement (the NYDIG Amendment\u201d) to include (i) 2,140 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S+ miners and (ii) 2,140 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S miners we purchased pursuant to a purchase agreement dated December 16, 2021, totaling $12,622,816 of additional borrowing capacity. We will pay an aggregate closing fee of $504,912 to NYDIG. The NYDIG Amendment requires that we maintain a blocked wallet or other account for deposits of all Mined Currency.\nWe entered into a hardware purchase and sales agreement with Cryptech effective April 1, 2021. Hardware includes, but is not limited to, ASIC miners, power supply units, power distribution units and replacement fans for ASIC miners. Total purchase price is $12,660,000 for 2,400 BitmainS19j miners to be delivered monthly in equal quantities (200 per month) from November 2021 through October 2022. All hardware must be paid for in advance before it is shipped to us. We made a 30% down payment of $3,798,000 on April 1, 2021 with the remaining 70% or $8,862,000, agreed to be paid in 17 installments.\nAcquisitions\nAs we continue to acquire miners and utilize our power generating assets to power such miners, we anticipate that a great proportion of our revenue and expenses will relate to crypto asset mining.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.\nReactive energy power is provided to maintain a continuous voltage level. Revenue from reactive power is recognized ratably over time as we stand ready to provide it if called upon by the PJM RTO.\nCryptocurrency Mining\n\u2022Consideration payable to a customer\nOn December 31, 2021, we amended the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement (the WhiteHawk Amendment\u201d) to extend the final MinerVa delivery date from December 31, 2021 to April 30, 2022. Pursuant to the WhiteHawk Amendment, Equipment, LLC paid an amendment fee in the amount of $250,000 to WhiteHawk. On March 28, 2022, Equipment LLC and WhiteHawk again amended the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement (the \"Second WhiteHawk Amendment\") to\nIn order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606's definition of a distinct\u201d good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct), and the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\nEnergy revenue is recognized over time as energy volumes are generated and delivered to the RTO (which is contemporaneous with generation), using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of the performance obligation. We apply the invoice practical expedient in recognizing energy revenue. Under the invoice practical expedient, energy revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is considered equal to the value provided to the customer for our performance obligation completed to date.\nManagement has assessed the basis of depreciation of our cryptocurrency machines used to verify digital currency transactions and generate digital currencies and believes they should be depreciated over a two-year period. The rate at which we generate digital assets and, therefore, consume the economic benefits of our transaction verification servers, is influenced by a number of factors including the following:\nexchange the collateral under the WhiteHawk Financing Agreement. Pursuant to the Second WhiteHawk Amendment, (i) the approximately 11,700 remaining miners under the MinerVa Purchase Agreement will be exchanged as collateral for additional miners received by us from other suppliers and (ii) WhiteHawk agreed to lend to us an additional amount not exceed $25.0 million to finance certain previously purchased Bitcoin miners and related equipment (the \"Second Total Advance\"). Pursuant to the Second WhiteHawk Amendment, Equipment, LLC paid an amendment fee in the amount of $275,414.40 and a closing fee with respect to the Second Total Advance of $500,000. In addition to the purchased Bitcoin miners and related equipment, Panther Creek and Scrubgrass each agreed to a negative pledge of the Panther Creek Plant and Scrubgrass Plant, respectively, and guaranteed the WhiteHawk Finance Agreement. Each of the negative pledge and the guaranty by Panther Creek and Scrubgrass will be released upon payment in full of the Second Total Advance, regardless of whether the Total Advance remains outstanding. In conjunction with the Second WhiteHawk Amendment, we issued a warrant to WhiteHawk to purchase 125,000 shares of Class A common stock, subject to certain antidilution and other adjustment provisions as described in the warrant agreement, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the Second WhiteHawk Warrant\u201d). The Second WhiteHawk Warrant expires on March 28, 2032. While we continue to engage in discussions with MinerVa on the delivery of the remaining miners, we do not know when the remaining miners will be delivered, if at all.\nFor equity-classified awards, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period based on the computed fair value on the grant date of the award. Equity classified awards include the issuance of stock options and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d).\nIn accordance with guidance on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities all derivatives should be recognized at fair value. Derivatives or any portion thereof, that are not designated as, and effective as, hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. Derivative contracts are classified as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying combined balance sheets. Certain contracts that require physical delivery may qualify for and be designated as normal purchases/normal sales. Such contracts are accounted for on an accrual basis.\nDuring 2018 and 2019, we began providing Bitcoin mining services to third parties and also began operating our own Bitcoin mining equipment to generate Bitcoin, which we then exchange for U.S. Dollars. We have been expanding our mining operations since such date. As of December 31, 2021 we operated approximately 8,000 crypto asset mining computers (known as miners\u201d) with hash rate exceeding 0.8 EH/s. As of December 31, 2021 we had entered into definitive agreements with suppliers to purchase approximately 39,000 additional miners, including the remaining MinerVa Semiconductor Corp. (\"MinerVa\") miners that were not yet delivered at year end, with a total hash capacity equal to approximately 4.0 EH/s. We do not know when the remaining 11,700 MinerVa miners will be delivered, if at all. Additionally, we are evaluating all available remedies under the MinerVa Purchase Agreement (as defined herein). We intend to house our miners at the Scrubgrass Plant, the Panther Creek Plant, the Third Plant or other power assets that we identify.\nCryptocurrency Operations Segment\nOn April 1, 2021, we effected the corporate reorganization described in \"Note 1 - Business Combinations\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nBitmain Technologies Limited Purchase Agreement\nOperations and maintenance expenses increased by $1.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from zero for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase includes technicians now required to support multiple data centers and maintenance, as well as repairs and operating parts to maintain a larger base of miners.\nSupplier Purchase Agreements\n1.Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer\nOn July 9, 2021, Stronghold Digital Mining Holdings LLC ( Stronghold LLC\u201d) entered into a purchase agreement for the Panther Creek Plant (the Panther Creek Acquisition\u201d), as contemplated by the Olympus LOI, from Olympus. The Panther Creek Acquisition includes all of the assets of Panther Creek Power Operating LLC, comprised primarily of the Panther Creek Plant. The Panther Creek Plant is a coal refuse reclamation facility with 80 MW of net electricity generation capacity located near Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania. We completed the Panther Creek Acquisition on November 2, 2021. The consideration for the Panther Creek Plant was approximately $2.2 million ($3 million less $800 thousand in shared land closing costs) in cash and 1,152,000 Class A common units of Stronghold LLC ( Stronghold LLC Units\u201d), together with a corresponding number of shares of Class V common stock. Effective November 2, 2021, we closed on this acquisition. Refer to \"Note 25 - Acquisition\" in the notes to our financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted by the removal of one-time transaction costs, periodic impairment of digital currencies, realized gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets, expenses related to stock-based compensation, gains or losses on derivative contracts, gain on extinguishment of debt, realized gain or loss on sale of digital currencies, waste coal credits, commission on sale of ash, or changes in fair value of warrant liabilities in the period presented.\nNorthern Data\nWe entered into a hardware purchase and sales agreement with Nowlit Solutions Corp effective April 1, 2021. Hardware includes, but is not limited to, ASIC miners, power supply units, power distribution units and replacement fans for ASIC miners. All hardware must be paid for in advance before it is shipped to us. We made payments totaling $5,657,432 in April 2021 and costs have been capitalized and reported as property and equipment.\nSupplier Purchase Agreements\nOn December 10, 2021, we entered into a Hardware Purchase and Sale Agreement (the First Supplier Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire 3,000 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S miners (the M30S Miners\u201d) with a hash rate per unit of 87 TH/s. Pursuant to the First Supplier Purchase Agreement, the unit price per M30S Miner is $6,960 for a cumulative purchase price of $20,880,000 that was paid in full within five business days of the execution of the First Supplier Purchase Agreement.\n\u2022Noncash consideration\nWarrant Liabilities\nEnergy Generation\nOperations and maintenance\nWe paid for two separate purchases of miners from Nowlit Solutions Corp. The first purchase payment was made on November 23, 2021, in the amount of $1,605,360 for 190 miners. The second purchase payment was made on November 26, 2021, in the amount of $2,486,730 for an additional 295 miners.\nWe operate in an emerging industry for which limited data is available to make estimates of the useful economic lives of specialized equipment. Management has determined that two years best reflects the current expected useful life of transaction verification servers. This assessment takes into consideration the availability of historical data and management's expectations regarding the direction of the industry including potential changes in technology. Management will review this estimate annually and will revise such estimate as and when data becomes available.\nLuxor Technology Corporation\nOverview\nCryptocurrency Hosting\nOn October 28, 2021, we entered into the first of two Non-Fixed Price Sales and Purchase Agreement with Bitmain. This first agreement covers six batches of 2,000 miners, or 12,000 in total, arriving on a monthly basis from April through September 2022. Each batch has an assigned purchase price that totals to $75,000,000, to be paid in three installments of 25%, 35% and 40% over the six-month delivery period. Per the agreement, on October 29, 2021, the Company made a $23,300,000 payment comprised of the 25% installment payment plus 35% of the April 2022 batch of 2,000 miners that have an assigned purchase price of $13,000,000. On November 18, 2021, the Company made an additional payment of 35% or $4,550,000 towards the April 2022 batch of miners.\nReorganization\nEffective October 21, 2021, we entered into a director and officer insurance policy with annual premiums totaling $6.9 million. We have executed a Commercial Premium Finance Agreement with AFCO Premium Credit LLC over a term of nine months, with an annual interest rate of 3.454%, that finances the payment of the total premiums owed. The agreement requires a $1.4 million down payment, with the remaining $5.5 million plus interest paid over nine months. Monthly payments of $621.3 thousand started November 21, 2021 and end July 21, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the unpaid balance is $4.3 million.", "item_7_tables": "Table 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
