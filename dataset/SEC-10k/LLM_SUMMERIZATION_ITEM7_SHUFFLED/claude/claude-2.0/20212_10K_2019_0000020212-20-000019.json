Financial Statements and Supplementary Data have been retroactively adjusted for prior periods to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\nKey Indicators to Evaluate Business Results and Financial Condition\nOur management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. These indicators include changes in net revenue, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, outstanding debt balance, operating cash flow and capital spend.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). We also use non-GAAP measures, including EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure of results of operations enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. Our chief operating decision maker utilizes Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance, develop strategy and allocate resources. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our operating results.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the following:\nAdjusted EBITDA includes our portion of the EBITDA from our equity investments.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes:\n\u2022Transaction expense, net which includes:\n\u25e6Acquisition and disposition related charges, including fair value adjustments related to earnouts and deferred payments;\n\u25e6Calder racing exit costs; and\n\u25e6Other transaction expense, including legal, accounting and other deal-related expense;\n\u2022Stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022Midwest Gaming's impact on our investments in unconsolidated affiliates from:\n\u25e6The impact of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps; and\n\u25e6Recapitalization and transaction costs;\n\u2022Asset impairments;\n\u2022Gain on Ocean Downs/Saratoga Transaction;\n\u2022Loss on extinguishment of debt;\n\u2022Legal reserves;\n\u2022Pre-opening expense; and\n\u2022Other charges, recoveries and expenses\nFor segment reporting, Adjusted EBITDA includes intercompany revenue and expense totals that are eliminated in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. See the Reconciliation of Comprehensive Income to Adjusted EBITDA included in this section for additional information.\nBusiness Highlights\nIn 2019, we delivered another year of strong performance while beginning the execution of a number of organic investments that we believe will provide long-term sustainable value creation.\n\u2022We delivered strong growth in net revenue and net income, operating income, and Adjusted EBITDA in 2019.\n-Net revenue was $1.3 billion, up $320.7 million, or 31.8%;\n-Operating income was $215.7 million, up $26.9 million, or 14.2%; and\n-Adjusted EBITDA was $451.4 million, up $122.6 million, or 37.3%.\n\u2022Churchill Downs Segment:\n-Derby Week generated an incremental $5.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2019 and set all-time wagering records from all sources handle on the Kentucky Oaks Day, the Kentucky Derby Day, and the Kentucky Derby Race. In October 2019, we announced plans to invest $300.0 million to build a hotel and HRM facility and permanent stadium seating.\n-Derby City Gaming outperformed expectations for 2019, contributing significant increases in both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022Online Wagering Segment:\n-TwinSpires handle grew to $1.5 billion, up 4.8% compared to 2018 as we outpaced the industry growth by 6.8 percentage points.\n-We launched our online sports betting and iGaming operations in New Jersey in the first quarter of 2019 and in Pennsylvania and Indiana in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\u2022Gaming Segment:\n-Our wholly-owned Gaming properties delivered strong organic growth from successful marketing and promotional activities, and we were able to successfully integrate our Presque Isle and Lady Luck Nemacolin transactions during 2019.\n-In March 2019, we closed on our 61.3% equity investment in Rivers Des Plaines which contributed strong Adjusted EBITDA results for the year. Rivers Des Plaines is well positioned to grow as a result of an expanded gaming bill in Illinois. Rivers Des Plaines has opened a new sports bar, received approval to become the first land-based casino in Illinois, is in process of building a parking garage, and is adding 800 additional positions. MVG announced a $100 million investment in a hotel that will open by the third quarter of 2021. Both of these investments are positioned well to provide strong growth in the coming years.\nAs we look to 2020 and beyond, we remain committed to delivering strong financial results and long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. We have strong cash flow and a solid balance sheet that supports organic growth as well as other strategic acquisitions and organic investment opportunities that we believe will create long-term value for our shareholders.\nOur Operations\nWe manage our operations through three reportable segments: Churchill Downs, Online Wagering, and Gaming.\nRefer to Part I, Item 1. Business, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our segments and a description of our competition and government regulations and potential legislative changes that affect our business.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nThe following table reflects our net revenue, operating income, net income, Adjusted EBITDA, and certain other financial information:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,329.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,009.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>320.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>215.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin </td> <td>16.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations </td> <td>139.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(43.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Churchill Downs Incorporated </td> <td>137.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(215.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>451.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\u2022Net revenue increased $320.7 million driven by a $242.9 million increase from the Gaming segment primarily due to the Presque Isle, Lady Luck Nemacolin and Ocean Downs/Saratoga Transactions, as well as growth at our other gaming properties, a $78.4 million increase from Churchill Downs primarily due to Derby City Gaming's continued growth and a full year of results compared to the prior year with the September 2018 opening, and a $0.3 million increase in our Online Wagering segment. Partially offsetting these increases was a $0.9 million decrease in All Other, primarily related to a decrease in handle at Arlington.\n\u2022Operating income increased $26.9 million due to a $45.8 million increase from Gaming primarily driven by the increase in net revenue; a $30.9 million increase from Churchill Downs primarily due to Derby City Gaming's continued growth and a full year of results compared to the prior year with the September 2018 opening; and a $5.0 million decrease in transaction expense, net. Partially offsetting these increases were a $31.4 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses driven by the Presque Isle, Lady Luck Nemacolin and Ocean Downs/Saratoga Transactions, and a full year of results for Derby City Gaming compared to the prior year with the September 2018 opening, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation; a $14.0 million decrease in All Other primarily due to an increase in salaries and related benefits at the corporate level and a decrease in handle and lower attendance at Arlington; and a $9.4 million decrease primarily from the Online Wagering segment for costs associated with the continued build-out of our online sports betting and iGaming operations and increased marketing spend.\n\u2022Net income from continuing operations decreased $43.0 million. The following items impacted comparability of the Company's year ended December 31, 2019 net income from continuing operations: a $42.3 million after-tax gain on the Ocean Downs/Saratoga Transaction in 2018 which did not recur in 2019; a $9.3 million after-tax impact of our equity portion of Midwest Gaming's non-cash change in fair value related to interest rate swaps in 2019; an $8.3 million non-cash tax impact related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities based on an increase in revenue related to states with higher tax rates compared to the prior year period; a $7.5 million after-tax impact for the accelerated amortization of the purchase and sale agreement rights related to the Turfway Park Acquisition in 2019; a $3.5 million after-tax impact of our equity portion of Midwest Gaming's recapitalization and transaction costs in 2019; and a $3.4 million after-tax increase in expenses due to legal reserves in 2019 compared to 2018. Partially offsetting these increases was a $3.0 million after-tax decrease in expenses related to lower transaction, pre-opening and other expenses. Excluding these items, net income from continuing operations increased $28.3 million primarily due to a $55.8 million after-tax increase driven by the results of our operations and equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by a $22.1 million after-tax increase in interest expense associated with higher outstanding debt balances and a $5.4 million tax expense related to a higher effective tax rate compared to the prior year period due to an increase in income attributable to states with higher tax rates.\n\u2022Our net income attributable to Churchill Downs Incorporated decreased $215.3 million due to a $43.0 million decrease in net income from continuing operations discussed above and a $172.6 million decrease in net income from discontinued operations driven by the after-tax gain on the sale of Big Fish Games in January 2018, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease from our net loss attributable to our noncontrolling interest.\n\u2022Our Adjusted EBITDA increased $122.6 million driven by a $106.9 million increase from the Gaming segment primarily due to the Presque Isle, Midwest Gaming, and Ocean Downs/Saratoga Transactions, as well as strong performances of our wholly-owned Gaming properties and our equity investment in MVG, and a $35.3 million increase from the Churchill Downs segment primarily due to Derby City Gaming's continued growth and a full year of results compared to the prior year with the September 2018 opening. Partially offsetting these increases were a $12.7\nmillion decrease from the Online Wagering segment for costs associated with the continued build-out of our online sports betting and iGaming operations and increased marketing spend, and a $6.9 million decrease from All Other mainly due to increased salaries and related benefits at the corporate level and a decrease in handle at Arlington.\nFinancial Results by Segment\nNet Revenue by Segment\nThe following table presents net revenue for our segments, including intercompany revenue:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Churchill Downs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Churchill Downs Racetrack </td> <td>$ </td> <td>202.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derby City Gaming </td> <td>86.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Churchill Downs </td> <td>289.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>208.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online Wagering: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twin Spires </td> <td>291.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>291.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online Sports Betting and iGaming </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Online Wagering </td> <td>291.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>291.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gaming: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Presque Isle </td> <td>139.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair Grounds Slots and VSI </td> <td>124.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oxford </td> <td>101.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calder </td> <td>99.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ocean Downs </td> <td>85.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Riverwalk </td> <td>58.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Harlow's </td> <td>55.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lady Luck Nemacolin </td> <td>29.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Saratoga </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Gaming </td> <td>694.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>451.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Other </td> <td>84.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations </td> <td>(30.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,329.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,009.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>320.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\u2022Churchill Downs revenue increased $80.9 million primarily due to a $71.8 million increase from a full year of results at Derby City Gaming due to the September 2018 opening and a $9.1 million increase at Churchill Downs Racetrack primarily due to a successful Kentucky Derby and Oaks week driven by increased ticket sales for reserved seating, sponsorship growth, and record handle.\n\u2022Online Wagering revenue increased $0.1 million from the prior year.

2018\nSignificant items affecting comparability of consolidated operating expense include:\n\u2022Taxes and purses increased $143.0 million driven by the Presque Isle, Ocean Downs/Saratoga, and Lady Luck Nemacolin Transactions, a full year of operations at Derby City Gaming due to the September 2018 opening, an increase in purse amounts at Churchill Downs Racetrack, the Turfway Park Acquisition, and the first racing meet at Oak Grove during the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\u2022Salaries and benefits expense increased $43.7 million driven by the Presque Isle, Ocean Downs/Saratoga, and Lady Luck Nemacolin Transactions, a full year operations at Derby City Gaming due to the September 2018 opening, an increase at Churchill Downs Racetrack consistent with the growth in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, and an increase with our online sports betting and iGaming business due to the launches in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Indiana during 2019.\n\u2022Content expense decreased $2.5 million primarily due to a decrease in certain host fees.\n\u2022Selling, general and administrative expense increased $31.4 million primarily from an increase in salaries and related benefits, stock-based compensation, legal reserves, and legal and professional fees.\n\u2022Depreciation and amortization expense increased $32.8 million primarily driven by the amortization of the assignment of the purchase and sale agreement rights associated with the Turfway Park Acquisition, the Presque Isle Transaction, a full year operations at Derby City Gaming due to the September 2018 opening, the Ocean Downs/Saratoga Transaction, and capital expenditures placed into service for Churchill Downs Racetrack.\n\u2022Marketing and advertising expense increased $13.0 million primarily due to our online sports betting and iGaming operations, the Presque Isle, Lady Luck Nemacolin, and Ocean Downs/Saratoga Transactions, and a full year of operations at Derby City Gaming due to the September 2018 opening.\n\u2022Transaction expense, net decreased $5.0 million primarily due to increased expenses associated with announced transactions in 2018 that did not recur in 2019.\n\u2022Other operating expense includes maintenance, utilities, food and beverage costs, property taxes and insurance and other operating expenses. Other operating expense increased $37.4 million primarily driven by the Presque Isle, Lady Luck Nemacolin, and Ocean Downs/Saratoga Transactions, a full year of operations at Derby City Gaming due to the September 2018 opening, our online sports betting and iGaming operations, and the Turfway Park Acquisition.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure of the results of operations enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our operating results.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Churchill Downs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online Wagering </td> <td>66.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gaming </td> <td>280.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>174.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>484.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Other </td> <td>(33.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>451.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>328.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\u2022Churchill Downs Adjusted EBITDA increased $35.3 million due to a $32.9 million increase from Derby City Gaming's continued growth and a full year of results compared to the prior year with the September 2018 opening and a $2.4 million increase at Churchill Downs Racetrack, primarily due to a successful Kentucky Derby and Oaks week driven by increased ticket sales for reserved seating, sponsorship growth, and record handle.\n\u2022Online Wagering Adjusted EBITDA decreased $12.7 million driven by a $12.1 million decrease due to costs associated with the continued build-out of our online sports betting and iGaming operations and increased marketing spend. TwinSpires Adjusted EBITDA decreased $0.6 million primarily due the decrease in net revenue.\n\u2022Gaming Adjusted EBITDA increased $106.9 million driven by a $94.3 million increase from our equity investment in Midwest Gaming and the Presque Isle and Lady Luck Nemacolin Transactions; a $4.9 million increase from our Mississippi properties primarily due to higher attendance driven by the opening of our retail BetAmerica Sportsbooks; a $3.7 million increase from our equity investment at MVG; a $2.7 million increase from Ocean Downs due to the acquisition of the remaining 37.5% of Ocean Downs partially offset by the liquidation of our equity investments in Saratoga as a result of the Ocean Downs/Saratoga Transaction; and a $2.7 million increase from Fair Grounds and VSI primarily due to two additional off-track betting facilities (\"OTBs\") and video poker facilities and successful marketing and promotional activities. Partially offsetting these increases were a $1.4 million decrease at Calder associated with the May 2019 opening of the jai alai operation and favorable insurance reserve adjustments in the prior year that did not recur in 2019.\n\u2022All Other Adjusted EBITDA decreased $6.9 million primarily from a $4.2 million increase in salaries and related benefits at the corporate level, a $2.0 million decrease at Arlington due to decreased handle and lower attendance primarily related to inclement weather, a $1.6 million decrease from our initial operations due to the first live racing meet at Oak Grove in the fourth quarter of 2019, and a $0.5 million decrease as a result of the Turfway Park Acquisition. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $1.4 million increase from United Tote primarily due to increased equipment sales and higher totalisator fees from new customers.\nReconciliation of

The 2017 Credit Agreement replaced our 2014 senior secured credit agreement (the \"2014 Credit Agreement\"). The 2017 Credit Agreement provides for a $700.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility due 2022 (the \"Revolver\") and a $400.0 million senior secured term loan B due 2024 (the \"Term Loan B\"). Included in the maximum borrowing of $700.0 million under the Revolver is a letter of credit sub facility not to exceed $50.0 million and a swing line commitment up to a maximum principal amount of $50.0 million. We had $694.4 million of available borrowing capacity, after consideration of $5.6 million in outstanding letters of credit, under the Revolver as of December 31, 2019. The 2017 Credit Amendment is secured by substantially all wholly-owned assets of the Company.\nThe Revolver bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread as determined by the Company's consolidated total net leverage ratio and the Term Loan B bears interest at LIBOR plus 200 basis points.\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, which include limitations on liens, investments, indebtedness, dispositions, mergers and acquisitions, the making of restricted payments, changes in the nature of business, changes in fiscal year, and transactions with affiliates. The 2017 Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants providing for the maintenance of a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio and the maintenance of a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants in the 2017 Credit Agreement at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, the financial ratios under our 2017 Credit Agreement were as follows:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td>Requirement </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest coverage ratio </td> <td>5.6 to 1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>> 2.5 to 1.0 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated total secured net leverage ratio </td> <td>0.6 to 1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>< 4.0 to 1.0 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Term Loan B requires quarterly payments of 0.25% of the original $400.0 million balance, or $1.0 million per quarter. The Term Loan B may be subject to additional mandatory prepayment from excess cash flow on an annual basis per the provisions of the 2017 Credit Agreement. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolver determined by a pricing grid based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the Company. For the period ended December 31, 2019, the Company's commitment fee rate was 0.30%.\nAs a result of the Company's 2017 Credit Agreement, the Company capitalized $1.6 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Revolver which will be amortized as interest expense over 5 years. The Company also capitalized $5.1 million of deferred financing costs associated with the Term Loan B which will be amortized as interest expense over 7 years.\n2027 Senior Notes\nOn March 25, 2019, we completed an offering of $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Unsecured Notes that mature on April 1, 2027 (the \"2027 Senior Notes\") in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and to certain non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2027 Senior Notes were issued at par, with interest payable on April 1st and October 1st of each year, commencing on October 1, 2019. The Company used the net\nproceeds from the offering to repay our outstanding balance on the Revolver portion of our 2017 Credit Agreement. In connection with the offering, we capitalized $8.9 million of debt issuance costs which are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2027 Senior Notes.\nThe 2027 Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated March 25, 2019 (the \"2027 Indenture\"), among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors (the \"2027 Guarantors\"), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Company may redeem some or all of the 2027 Senior Notes at any time prior to April 1, 2022, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Senior Notes redeemed plus an applicable make-whole premium.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience, contract terms, observance of known trends in our Company and the industry as a whole and information available from other outside sources. Our estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those initial estimates.\nOur critical accounting estimates relate to goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nGoodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets\nAcquisition of certain identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of a business, the Company records identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of gaming rights and trademarks. Gaming rights and trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets that do not require amortization based on our future expectations to operate our gaming facilities and use the trademarks indefinitely, and our historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal cost with various state gaming commissions.\nWe use various valuation methods to determine initial fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the Greenfield method and relief-from-royalty method of the income approach, all of which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. The use of these valuation methods requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future revenue and operating expenses, expected start-up costs, royalty rate and the discount rate. The fair values of gaming rights are generally determined using the Greenfield method, which is an income approach methodology that calculates the present value of the overall business enterprise based on a projected cash flow stream. This method assumes that the gaming rights provides the opportunity to develop a casino in a specified region, and that the present value of the projected cash flows are a result of the realization of advantages contained in these rights. Under this methodology, the acquirer is expected to absorb all start-up costs, as well as incur all expenses pertaining to the acquisition and/or the creation of all tangible and intangible assets. The estimated future revenue and operating expenses, start-up costs of the acquired business, and the discount rate are the primary assumptions and estimates used in these valuations. The fair values of trademarks are generally determined using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach, which estimates the fair value of the intangible asset by discounting the fair value of the hypothetical royalty payments a market participant would be willing to pay to enjoy the benefits of the trademarks. The estimated future revenue, royalty rate, and the discount rate are the primary assumptions and estimates used in these valuations. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are generally derived from the weighted average cost of capital analysis and adjusted for the size and/or risk of the asset.\nAssessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets\nWe perform our annual review for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on April 1 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the asset is impaired. Adverse industry or economic trends, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization, among other items, may be indications of potential impairment issues which are triggering events requiring the testing of an asset's carrying value for recoverability.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset is impaired. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to complete the two-step impairment test using a more likely than not criteria. If an entity believes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, including goodwill, the quantitative impairment test can be bypassed. Alternatively, an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the two-step quantitative impairment test. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, among others. These factors require significant judgments and estimates, and application of alternative assumptions could produce materially different results. Evaluations of possible impairment utilizing the two-step approach require us to estimate, among other factors, forecasts of future operating results, revenue growth, EBITDA margin, tax rates, capital expenditures, depreciation, working capital, weighted average cost of capital, long-term growth rates, risk premiums, terminal values, and fair values of our reporting units and assets. The goodwill impairment test is subject to uncertainties arising from such events as changes in competitive conditions, the current general economic environment, material changes in growth rate assumptions that could positively or negatively impact anticipated future operating conditions and cash flows, changes in the discount rate, and the impact of strategic decisions. If any of these factors were to materially change, such change may require a reevaluation of our goodwill. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.", "item_7_truncated": "\u2022Turfway Park\n\u2022Our net income attributable to Churchill Downs Incorporated decreased $215.3 million due to a $43.0 million decrease in net income from continuing operations discussed above and a $172.6 million decrease in net income from discontinued operations driven by the after-tax gain on the sale of Big Fish Games in January 2018, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease from our net loss attributable to our noncontrolling interest.\nFor additional information on the Presque Isle Transaction and the Lady Luck Nemacolin Transactions, refer to Note 3 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.

Partially offsetting these increases was an $18.2 million decrease in capital project expenditures and $9.1 million decrease in funds used in other investing activities.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset is impaired. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to complete the two-step impairment test using a more likely than not criteria. If an entity believes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, including goodwill, the quantitative impairment test can be bypassed. Alternatively, an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the two-step quantitative impairment test. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, among others. These factors require significant judgments and estimates, and application of alternative assumptions could produce materially different results. Evaluations of possible impairment utilizing the two-step approach require us to estimate, among other factors, forecasts of future operating results, revenue growth, EBITDA margin, tax rates, capital expenditures, depreciation, working capital, weighted average cost of capital, long-term growth rates, risk premiums, terminal values, and fair values of our reporting units and assets. The goodwill impairment test is subject to uncertainties arising from such events as changes in competitive conditions, the current general economic environment, material changes in growth rate assumptions that could positively or negatively impact anticipated future operating conditions and cash flows, changes in the discount rate, and the impact of strategic decisions. If any of these factors were to materially change, such change may require a reevaluation of our goodwill. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.\nITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn December 27, 2017, we completed an offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Unsecured Notes that mature on January 15, 2028 (the \"2028 Senior Notes\") in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and to certain non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2028 Senior Notes were issued at par, with interest payable on January 15th and July 15th of each year, commencing on July 15, 2018. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2017 Credit Agreement to repay the remaining outstanding amount of our $600.0 million 5.375% Senior Unsecured Notes that were scheduled to mature on December 15, 2021. In connection with the offering, we capitalized $7.7 million of debt issuance costs which are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2028 Senior Notes.\nThe Gaming segment includes revenue and expenses for the casino properties and associated racetrack or jai alai facilities which support the casino license. The Gaming segment has approximately 11,000 slot machines and VLTs and 200 table games located in eight states.\nWe use various valuation methods to determine initial fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the Greenfield method and relief-from-royalty method of the income approach, all of which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. The use of these valuation methods requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future revenue and operating expenses, expected start-up costs, royalty rate and the discount rate. The fair values of gaming rights are generally determined using the Greenfield method, which is an income approach methodology that calculates the present value of the overall business enterprise based on a projected cash flow stream. This method assumes that the gaming rights provides the opportunity to develop a casino in a specified region, and that the present value of the projected cash flows are a result of the realization of advantages contained in these rights. Under this methodology, the acquirer is expected to absorb all start-up costs, as well as incur all expenses pertaining to the acquisition and/or the creation of all tangible and intangible assets. The estimated future revenue and operating expenses, start-up costs of the acquired business, and the discount rate are the primary assumptions and estimates used in these valuations. The fair values of trademarks are generally determined using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach, which estimates the fair value of the intangible asset by discounting the fair value of the hypothetical royalty payments a market participant would be willing to pay to enjoy the benefits of the trademarks. The estimated future revenue, royalty rate, and the discount rate are the primary assumptions and estimates used in these valuations.

Partially offsetting these increases was an $18.2 million decrease in capital project expenditures and $9.1 million decrease in funds used in other investing activities.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset is impaired. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to complete the two-step impairment test using a more likely than not criteria. If an entity believes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, including goodwill, the quantitative impairment test can be bypassed. Alternatively, an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the two-step quantitative impairment test. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, among others. These factors require significant judgments and estimates, and application of alternative assumptions could produce materially different results. Evaluations of possible impairment utilizing the two-step approach require us to estimate, among other factors, forecasts of future operating results, revenue growth, EBITDA margin, tax rates, capital expenditures, depreciation, working capital, weighted average cost of capital, long-term growth rates, risk premiums, terminal values, and fair values of our reporting units and assets. The goodwill impairment test is subject to uncertainties arising from such events as changes in competitive conditions, the current general economic environment, material changes in growth rate assumptions that could positively or negatively impact anticipated future operating conditions and cash flows, changes in the discount rate, and the impact of strategic decisions. If any of these factors were to materially change, such change may require a reevaluation of our goodwill. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.\nITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn December 27, 2017, we completed an offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Unsecured Notes that mature on January 15, 2028 (the \"2028 Senior Notes\") in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and to certain non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2028 Senior Notes were issued at par, with interest payable on January 15th and July 15th of each year, commencing on July 15, 2018. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2017 Credit Agreement to repay the remaining outstanding amount of our $600.0 million 5.375% Senior Unsecured Notes that were scheduled to mature on December 15, 2021. In connection with the offering, we capitalized $7.7 million of debt issuance costs which are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2028 Senior Notes.\nThe Gaming segment includes revenue and expenses for the casino properties and associated racetrack or jai alai facilities which support the casino license. The Gaming segment has approximately 11,000 slot machines and VLTs and 200 table games located in eight states.\nWe use various valuation methods to determine initial fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the Greenfield method and relief-from-royalty method of the income approach, all of which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. The use of these valuation methods requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future revenue and operating expenses, expected start-up costs, royalty rate and the discount rate. The fair values of gaming rights are generally determined using the Greenfield method, which is an income approach methodology that calculates the present value of the overall business enterprise based on a projected cash flow stream. This method assumes that the gaming rights provides the opportunity to develop a casino in a specified region, and that the present value of the projected cash flows are a result of the realization of advantages contained in these rights. Under this methodology, the acquirer is expected to absorb all start-up costs, as well as incur all expenses pertaining to the acquisition and/or the creation of all tangible and intangible assets. The estimated future revenue and operating expenses, start-up costs of the acquired business, and the discount rate are the primary assumptions and estimates used in these valuations. The fair values of trademarks are generally determined using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach, which estimates the fair value of the intangible asset by discounting the fair value of the hypothetical royalty payments a market participant would be willing to pay to enjoy the benefits of the trademarks. The estimated future revenue, royalty rate, and the discount rate are the primary assumptions and estimates used in these valuations. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are generally derived from the weighted average cost of capital analysis and adjusted for the size and/or risk of the asset.\nWe perform our annual review for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on April 1 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the asset is impaired. Adverse industry or economic trends, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization, among other items, may be indications of potential impairment issues which are triggering events requiring the testing of an asset's carrying value for recoverability.\nFor additional information on the Sale Transaction and Recapitalization, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n\u2022Selling, general and administrative expense increased $31.4 million primarily from an increase in salaries and related benefits, stock-based compensation, legal reserves, and legal and professional fees.\nsuccessful marketing and promotional activities.

Following the closing of the Sale Transaction, the parties completed a recapitalization transaction on March 6, 2019 (the \"Recapitalization\"), pursuant to which Midwest Gaming used approximately $300.0 million in proceeds from amended and extended credit facilities to redeem, on a pro rata basis, additional Midwest Gaming units held by High Plaines and Casino Investors. As a result of the Recapitalization, the Company's ownership of Midwest Gaming increased to 61.3%. High Plaines retained ownership of 36.0% of Midwest Gaming and Casino Investors retained ownership of 2.7% of Midwest Gaming.\n\u25e6Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin (\"Lady Luck Nemacolin\") management agreement\n\u2022Total shareholders' equity increased $37.7 million driven by $137.5 million current year net income attributable to Churchill Downs Incorporated and a $23.8 million increase resulting from stock-based compensation. Partially offsetting these increases were $93.0 million in repurchases of common stock, $23.4 million from our annual dividend declared in December 2019, and a $7.2 million decrease in other equity components.\nThe following table is a summary of our overall financial position:\n\u25e6Presque Isle Downs and Casino (\"Presque Isle\")\nOn December 27, 2017, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\") with a syndicate of lenders. The 2017 Credit Agreement replaced our 2014 senior secured credit agreement (the \"2014 Credit Agreement\"). The 2017 Credit Agreement provides for a $700.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility due 2022 (the \"Revolver\") and a $400.0 million senior secured term loan B due 2024 (the \"Term Loan B\"). Included in the maximum borrowing of $700.0 million under the Revolver is a letter of credit sub facility not to exceed $50.0 million and a swing line commitment up to a maximum principal amount of $50.0 million. We had $694.4 million of available borrowing capacity, after consideration of $5.6 million in outstanding letters of credit, under the Revolver as of December 31, 2019. The 2017 Credit Amendment is secured by substantially all wholly-owned assets of the Company.\n\u2022Gaming Segment:\nAs we look to 2020 and beyond, we remain committed to delivering strong financial results and long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. We have strong cash flow and a solid balance sheet that supports organic growth as well as other strategic acquisitions and organic investment opportunities that we believe will create long-term value for our shareholders.\n\u2022Corporate\nFinancial Results by Segment\n\u2022Marketing and advertising expense increased $13.0 million primarily due to our online sports betting and iGaming operations, the Presque Isle, Lady Luck Nemacolin, and Ocean Downs/Saratoga Transactions, and a full year of operations at Derby City Gaming due to the September 2018 opening.\nReconciliation of Comprehensive Income to Adjusted EBITDA\nCredit Facilities and Indebtedness\n-Adjusted EBITDA was $451.4 million, up $122.6 million, or 37.3%.\n\nThe Online Wagering segment includes the revenue and expenses for our TwinSpires business (\"TwinSpires\") and our online sports betting and iGaming business.\n\u25e6The impact of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps; and\nOur significant accounting policies and recently adopted accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOf the $46.0 million total consideration, $36.0 million, less $0.9 million of working capital and purchase price adjustments, was accounted for as a business combination. The remaining $10.0 million was paid to Hard Rock for the assignment of the purchase and sale agreement rights and was accounted for separately from the business combination as an intangible asset and was amortized through expense in the fourth quarter of 2019. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on the Turfway Park Acquisition.\n-In March 2019, we closed on our 61.3% equity investment in Rivers Des Plaines which contributed strong Adjusted EBITDA results for the year. Rivers Des Plaines is well positioned to grow as a result of an expanded gaming bill in Illinois. Rivers Des Plaines has opened a new sports bar, received approval to become the first land-based casino in Illinois, is in process of building a parking garage, and is adding 800 additional positions. MVG announced a $100 million investment in a hotel that will open by the third quarter of 2021. Both of these investments are positioned well to provide strong growth in the coming years.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). We also use non-GAAP measures, including EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure of results of operations enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. Our chief operating decision maker utilizes Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance, develop strategy and allocate resources. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our operating results.\nThe 2027 Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated March 25, 2019 (the \"2027 Indenture\"), among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors (the \"2027 Guarantors\"), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Company may redeem some or all of the 2027 Senior Notes at any time prior to April 1, 2022, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Senior Notes redeemed plus an applicable make-whole premium. On or after such date, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2027 Senior Notes at redemption prices set forth in the 2027 Indenture. In addition, at any time prior to April 1, 2022, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 105.50% of the principal amount thereof with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings provided that certain conditions are met. The terms of the 2027 Indenture, among other things, limit the ability of the Company to: (i) incur additional debt and issue preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends or make other restricted payments; (iii) make certain investments; (iv) create liens; (v) allow restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) merge or consolidate with other entities; and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates.\n\u25e650% equity investment in Miami Valley Gaming and Racing (\"MVG\")\nreceivable driven by Churchill Downs Racetrack and the Presque Isle Transaction; and a $13.3 million increase in all other assets. Partially offsetting these increases was a $37.1 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily due to our equity investment in Midwest Gaming, the Presque Isle Transaction, and the Turfway Park Acquisition.\n-Derby City Gaming outperformed expectations for 2019, contributing significant increases in both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022All Other Adjusted EBITDA decreased $6.9 million primarily from a $4.2 million increase in salaries and related benefits at the corporate level, a $2.0 million decrease at Arlington due to decreased handle and lower attendance primarily related to inclement weather, a $1.6 million decrease from our initial operations due to the first live racing meet at Oak Grove in the fourth quarter of 2019, and a $0.5 million decrease as a result of the Turfway Park Acquisition. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $1.4 million increase from United Tote primarily due to increased equipment sales and higher totalisator fees from new customers.\n-Derby Week generated an incremental $5.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2019 and set all-time wagering records from all sources handle on the Kentucky Oaks Day, the Kentucky Derby Day, and the Kentucky Derby Race. In October 2019, we announced plans to invest $300.0 million to build a hotel and HRM facility and permanent stadium seating.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared to the Year Ended December 31,
