Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section generally discusses the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 items and comparisons between these fiscal years. Discussions of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 items and comparisons between the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Item 7 of Part II, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on May 18, 2020.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on redefining care for women and for men through purpose-driven science, empowering medicines, and transformative advocacy. ORGOVYXTM (relugolix) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) in 2020 as the first and only oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH\u201d) receptor antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix is also under regulatory review in Europe for men with advanced prostate cancer. In addition, relugolix combination tablet (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) is under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe for women with uterine fibroids, has completed Phase 3 registration-enabling studies for women with endometriosis, and is being assessed for contraceptive efficacy in healthy women ages 18-35 years who are at risk for pregnancy. We are also developing MVT-602, an oligopeptide kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist, which has completed a Phase 2a study for the treatment of female infertility as a part of assisted reproduction.\nSince our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to identifying and in-licensing our product candidates, organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, preparing for and advancing the clinical development of our product candidates, preparing for and achieving regulatory approvals, and preparing for and executing on commercialization of our product candidates. Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our common shares, from debt financing arrangements, and more recently from the upfront and milestone payments we received from Pfizer Inc. ( Pfizer\u201d) and Gedeon Richter Plc. ( Richter\u201d). We launched our first product, ORGOVYX, in the U.S. in January 2021 and began generating product revenue, net from sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. in January 2021.\nOur majority shareholder is Sumitovant Biopharma Ltd. ( Sumitovant\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. ( Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma\u201d). As of March 31, 2021, Sumitovant directly, and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma indirectly, own 48,641,181, or approximately 53.5%, of our outstanding common shares.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2021 and Recent Business Updates\nIn this section, we summarize certain of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and recent clinical, regulatory, and corporate updates. Additional information about our business, our approved product, and our product candidates is included in Part I. Item 1., Business,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProduct and Product Candidates\nAdvanced Prostate Cancer (HERO Program)\n\u2022On December 18, 2020, the FDA approved ORGOVYX for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. ORGOVYX, which was granted Priority Review by the FDA, is the first and only oral GnRH receptor antagonist for men with advanced prostate cancer.\n\u2022ORGOVYX became commercially available through authorized specialty distributors in the U.S. in early January 2021. Our oncology sales force began promoting ORGOVYX to target prescribers in early January 2021 and the uro-oncology sales force of our collaboration partner, Pfizer, began actively promoting ORGOVYX to target prescribers in early February 2021.\n\u2022On March 29, 2021, we announced that the European Medicines Agency ( EMA\u201d) validated our previously submitted Marketing Authorization Application ( MAA\u201d) for relugolix for the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer. The validation of the application confirmed that the submission is sufficiently complete for the EMA to begin the formal review process. If approved, relugolix would be the first and only oral androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer in Europe.\n\u2022In May 2020, efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 HERO study were simultaneously published online in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO\u201d)'s ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program.\nUterine Fibroids (LIBERTY Program)\n\u2022In May 2020, we submitted a New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) to the FDA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, which has been accepted by the FDA with a target action date of June 1, 2021. If approved, we and Pfizer expect to launch relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of uterine fibroids in the U.S. in June 2021.\n\u2022On September 14, 2020, we announced one-year data on bone mineral density from the Phase 3 LIBERTY program and from a prospective observational study of women with uterine fibroids.\n\u2022On October 21, 2020, we presented one-year efficacy and safety data from the LIBERTY long-term extension study at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine ( ASRM\u201d) 2020 Virtual Congress.\n\u2022In February 2021, we and our collaboration partner, Pfizer, announced publication in the New England Journal of Medicine of the Phase 3 LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies of investigational once-daily relugolix combination therapy in women with uterine fibroids.\n\u2022On March 24, 2021, we and Pfizer announced positive safety and efficacy data from the LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study.\nEndometriosis (SPIRIT Program)\n\u2022On April 22, 2020 and June 23, 2020, we announced positive top-line results from the SPIRIT 2 and SPIRIT 1 studies, respectively.\n\u2022On October 20, 2020, data from the Phase 3 SPIRIT studies were presented at the ASRM 2020 Virtual Congress and the presentation was named the Prize Paper by the Endometriosis Special Interest Group.\n\u2022On January 26, 2021, we and Pfizer announced positive one-year safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 SPIRIT long-term extension study.\nPrevention of Pregnancy (SERENE Program)\n\u2022On April 12, 2021, we and Pfizer announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase 3 single-arm, open-label SERENE study evaluating the contraceptive efficacy of relugolix combination tablet in healthy women ages 18-35 years who are at risk for pregnancy.\nStrategic Partnerships\n\u2022In December 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer under which we and Pfizer will jointly develop and commercialize relugolix in oncology and women's health and equally share profits and certain expenses, in the U.S. and Canada (the Co-Promotion Territory\u201d). In December 2020, we received a $650.0 million upfront payment and we are eligible to receive up to $3.7 billion of additional milestone payments, including two regulatory milestones of $100.0 million upon each FDA approval for relugolix combination tablet in uterine fibroids and endometriosis ($200.0 million in the aggregate), and tiered sales milestones of up to $3.5 billion upon reaching certain thresholds of annual net sales for oncology and the combined women's health indications in the Co-Promotion Territory. We granted Pfizer an exclusive option to acquire development and commercialization rights to relugolix in oncology outside of the Co-Promotion Territory (excluding certain Asian markets). If Pfizer exercises this option, we will receive an additional $50.0 million payment and will be eligible to receive double-digit royalties on net sales. Pfizer's decision is expected in mid-calendar year 2021.\n\u2022In August 2020, we entered into a three-year commercial collaboration agreement with Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Sunovion\u201d). Under the agreement, Sunovion will provide certain third-party logistics, trade and retail distribution, contract operations, and market access account management services, and other services to us and, Sunovion will become a non-exclusive distributor of relugolix for prostate cancer and the exclusive distributor of relugolix combination tablet for uterine fibroids and endometriosis in the U.S.\nCorporate\n\u2022On January 4, 2021, we announced the appointment of David Marek as Chief Executive Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc. Concurrent with this appointment, Mr. Marek was also appointed as Principal Executive Officer of Myovant Sciences Ltd. and as a member of our board of directors. Mr. Marek succeeds Dr. Lynn Seely, who previously held these positions.\n\u2022On April 5, 2021, we announced the appointment of Lauren Merendino as Chief Commercial Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc.\n\u2022As of March 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $684.9 million. We currently believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nExpected Upcoming Clinical and Regulatory Milestones\nIn this section, we summarize certain of our expected upcoming clinical and regulatory milestones.\n\u2022FDA decision for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of uterine fibroids expected by the June 1, 2021 target action date. If approved, we and Pfizer expect to launch relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of uterine fibroids in the U.S. in June 2021. Upon approval, we will receive a $100.0 million regulatory milestone payment from Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement.\n\u2022Regulatory submission to the FDA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with endometriosis-associated pain expected in the second quarter of calendar year 2021.\n\u2022European Commission decision on the uterine fibroids MAA expected in mid-calendar year 2021. If approved, this launch will be executed by Richter, our commercialization partner for relugolix combination tablet for the uterine fibroids and endometriosis indications in Europe and certain other international markets.\n\u2022MAA submission to the EMA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with endometriosis-associated pain expected in calendar year 2021. Richter will be the MAA sponsor.\n\u2022European Commission decision on the advanced prostate cancer MAA expected in calendar year 2022.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic resulting from the disease known as COVID-19 caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-Co V-2. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed essential,\u201d isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing when engaging in essential activities. In certain countries, and in certain states within the U.S., such orders have been lifted, although recent trends in COVID-19 infections have led to the reinstatement of such orders in various jurisdictions. It remains unclear how long these measures will remain in place and whether these measures will be effective. Further, recently it has been reported that the rate of the reported number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is increasing, and new more virulent variants of the coronavirus have been identified, which may further impact the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on us.\nIn an effort to protect the safety of our employees and our patients, we adopted safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that meet or exceed the guidelines established by government and public health officials. These measures include adopting policies applicable to office-based employees such as working from home, limiting the number of employees on site, and limiting business travel. At this time, we have not identified a material change to our productivity as a result of these measures, but this could change, particularly if restricted travel, closed schools, and shelter-in-place orders are not removed or significantly eased.\nTo date, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to advance our clinical studies, our regulatory activities, our U.S. commercial launch activities for ORGOVYX, and our preparations for the potential commercialization of relugolix combination tablet has been limited and all of our publicly announced milestones remain on track. The FDA approved ORGOVYX for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer on December 18, 2020. In May 2020, we submitted our NDA to the FDA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with heavy menstrual bleeding\nassociated with uterine fibroids, which has been accepted by the FDA with a target action date of June 1, 2021. We launched ORGOVYX in the U.S. in early January 2021, and may launch other approved products in the COVID-19 environment. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals may reduce staffing and reduce or postpone appointments with patients, or patients may cancel or miss appointments, resulting in potential delays in diagnosis and treatment, and therefore fewer prescriptions. In addition, multiple medical conferences have been cancelled, postponed or moved to virtual formats, resulting in fewer opportunities to present our scientific data. In addition, our sales teams have been and would likely have to continue to make presentations to physicians and the medical community in many cases by virtual means instead of in-person, which could reduce the number of medical professionals we are able to present to, and these virtual meetings may not be as successful as in-person meetings. Reduced access to healthcare providers as a result of social distancing protocols may impact or require adjustments to our planned commercialization activities, including the manner in which our field teams engage with healthcare providers and facilities. At this time, we do not believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted us relative to other companies in our industry and the medical community appears to be highly engaged with our field team. To date, we have not experienced supply constraints, and we believe we have procured sufficient quantities of relugolix drug substance to meet our U.S. ORGOVYX launch plans and U.S. launch plans for relugolix combination tablet, if approved.\nWe have taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions, in our approach to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state, and local public health authorities and may take additional action based on their recommendations. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our financial results, our clinical studies, our supply chains, our commercial launch for ORGOVYX, and pre-launch commercial readiness activities for relugolix combination tablet, end user demand for our products, if approved, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot estimate the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Refer to the risk factor titled Business interruptions resulting from effects of pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition,\u201d as well as other risk factors included in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d set forth in Part I. Item 1A.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nOn December 18, 2020, the FDA approved ORGOVYX for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. In January 2021, we began to generate product revenue from sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. We record product revenue net of estimated discounts, chargebacks, rebates, product returns, and other gross-to-net revenue deductions.\nOur collaboration revenue represents the partial amortization of the upfront payment we received from Pfizer pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOur license and milestone revenue represents the partial recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with upfront and regulatory milestone payments we received from Richter pursuant to the terms of the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement (see Note 13(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We recognize revenue as we satisfy our combined performance obligation to Richter.\nCost of Product Revenue\nOur cost of product revenue is composed of the cost of goods sold and royalty expense. Our cost of goods sold consists of raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs to manufacture the raw materials into finished product, freight, and indirect overhead costs associated with sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. Our royalty expense consists of a fixed, high single-digit royalty on net sales of ORGOVYX payable to Takeda pursuant to the terms of the Takeda License Agreement (see Note 14(D) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nIn connection with the FDA approval of ORGOVYX on December 18, 2020, we subsequently began capitalizing inventory manufactured or purchased after this date. As a result, we expensed certain manufacturing costs of ORGOVYX as R&D expenses prior to FDA approval and, therefore, these costs are not included in cost of goods sold.\nCollaboration Expense to Pfizer\nOur collaboration expense to Pfizer consists of Pfizer's 50% share of net profits from sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur R&D expenses to date have been primarily attributable to the clinical development of our product candidates including the conduct of multiple Phase 3 and earlier clinical studies, the expansion of our team, and the initiation of activities in preparation for our anticipated commercial launches such as the establishment of our medical affairs function, as well as regulatory and certain manufacturing activities. Our R&D expenses include program-specific costs, as well as costs that are not allocated to a specific program.\nOur program-specific costs primarily include third-party costs, which include expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and CMOs, the cost of consultants who assist with the development of our product candidates on a program-specific basis, investigator grants, sponsored research, manufacturing costs in connection with producing materials for use in conducting nonclinical and clinical studies, as well as costs related to pre-commercial manufacturing activities and regulatory submissions, and other third-party expenses directly attributable to the development of our product candidates.\nOur unallocated R&D costs primarily include employee-related expenses, such as salaries, share-based compensation, fringe benefits and travel for employees engaged in R&D activities including clinical operations, biostatistics, regulatory, and medical affairs, and the cost of contractors and consultants who assist with R&D activities not specific to a program and costs associated with nonclinical studies.\nR&D activities have been, and will continue to be, central to our business model. We currently expect R&D expenses for the year ending March 31, 2022, to be modestly lower than the R&D expenses incurred in the year ended March 31, 2021, largely due to our sharing of certain expenses with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Overall, we expect declining spend on our Phase 3 clinical programs that are winding down to be offset primarily by incremental spend on new relugolix development programs, such as the Phase 3 SERENE study, to potentially expand the commercial opportunity for the relugolix franchise.\nThe duration, costs and timing of clinical studies and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: the number of studies required for approval; the per patient study costs; the number of patients who participate in the studies; the number of sites included in the studies; the countries in which the studies are conducted; the length of time required to recruit and enroll eligible patients; the number of patients who fail to meet the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria; the number of study drug doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; the potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; the duration of patient follow-up; the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals; the costs of clinical study materials; and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.\nIn addition, the probability of commercial success for ORGOVYX, or for any of our current or potential future product candidates, if approved, will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. As a result, we are unable to determine with certainty to what extent we will generate net product revenue from commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval. Our R&D activities may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our priorities and available resources.\nWe expect that certain R&D expenses will be shared equally with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur SG&A expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, sales incentive compensation, bonuses, fringe benefits, and share-based compensation expenses for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, commercial operations, marketing, market access, sales, and other administrative functions. Our SG&A expenses also include marketing programs, advertising, conferences, congresses, travel expenses, professional fees for legal, accounting, auditing and tax services, and costs related to rent and facilities, insurance, information technology, commercial operations, and general overhead. Our SG&A expenses also include costs incurred under our Market Access Services Agreement with Sunovion and our former consulting agreement with Sumitovant, which expired on March 31, 2021.\nWe expect SG&A expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure and capabilities as well as general administrative functions to support multiple product launches and commercialization activities. These increases will likely include expenses associated with our oncology sales force which began promoting ORGOVYX in the U.S. in January 2021, as well as expected costs associated with the further build out of our commercial operations functions and the hiring of our women's health sales force in advance of the potential FDA approval of relugolix combination tablet. SG&A expenses in future periods are also expected to include certain expenses related to our patient support programs such as\nfree trial drug and patient assistance for qualified uninsured patients. The timing of these increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on our commercial success and sales growth of ORGOVYX, as well as the timing of any new product launches and other potential business and operational activities.\nWe expect that certain SG&A expenses will be shared equally with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense through December 31, 2019 consists of interest expense related to our previously outstanding debt with Hercules Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d) and NovaQuest Capital Management ( NovaQuest\u201d), which we repaid on December 31, 2019, as well as the associated non-cash amortization of related debt discounts and issuance costs. Subsequently, our interest expense consists of related party interest expense pursuant to the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, which bears interest at a rate per annum equal to 3-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3% payable on the last day of each calendar quarter. For the year ended March 31, 2021, our interest expense also includes accretion of the financing component of the cost share advance from Pfizer. See Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the carrying amount of our previously outstanding debt with Hercules and NovaQuest and the amounts we paid to retire the outstanding debt obligations on December 31, 2019.\nInterest Income\nOur interest income consists primarily of interest earned and the accretion of discounts to maturity for cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nForeign Exchange Gain\nOur foreign exchange gain consists of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign exchange denominated liabilities, relative to the U.S. dollar. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations fluctuates period over period based on our foreign currency exposures resulting from changes in applicable exchange rates associated with our foreign denominated liabilities. Our primary foreign currency exposure has historically been the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.\nIn December 2020, we changed the functional currency of our wholly-owned subsidiary in Switzerland, MSG, from the Swiss franc to the U.S. dollar. This change in functional currency is accounted for prospectively. As a result of this change, we currently expect that future impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations will not be significant. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenue, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and milestone revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs and expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration expense to Pfizer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192,560 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,327 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating costs and expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>274,887 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(260,784) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(274,887) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,663 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,851 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(211) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,552) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange gain </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,176) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,621) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(254,798) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(288,228) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>761 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(255,134) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(288,989) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nOur revenues to date have been generated substantially from the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement and the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, which are further discussed in Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We began commercializing ORGOVYX in the U.S. for adult patients with advanced prostate cancer in January 2021.\nProduct revenue, net from sales of ORGOVYX was $3.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2021. There were no such amounts recognized for the year ended March 31, 2020. Product revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts, chargebacks, rebates, product returns, and other gross-to-net revenue deductions.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended March 31, 2021 represents the partial amortization of the upfront payment received from Pfizer pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement. There were no such amounts recognized for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nLicense and milestone revenue for the year ended March 31, 2021 represents the partial recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with upfront and regulatory milestone payments we received from Richter pursuant to the terms of the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement. There were no such amounts recognized for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nCost of Product Revenue\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, our cost of product revenue was $0.3 million, which includes the cost of goods sold and royalty expense payable to Takeda pursuant to the Takeda License Agreement (see Note 14(D) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nIn connection with the FDA approval of ORGOVYX on December 18, 2020, we subsequently began capitalizing the cost of inventory manufactured or purchased after this date. Prior to December 18, 2020, costs to manufacture ORGOVYX were expensed as incurred as R&D expenses. As a result, minimal cost of goods sold has been recorded for quantities of ORGOVYX\nsold during for the year ended March 31, 2021 as these costs were previously recorded as R&D expenses. We expect our cost of goods sold to increase in future periods as quantities of zero-cost ORGOVYX inventory are depleted from our inventory stock.\nCollaboration Expense to Pfizer\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, our collaboration expense to Pfizer was $1.7 million and represents Pfizer's 50% share of net profits from the sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nResearch and Development Expenses\nFor the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, our R&D expenses consisted of the following (in thousands):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Program-specific costs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Relugolix </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(71,902) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MVT-602 </td> <td>241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,457) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated costs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation </td> <td>14,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(475) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel expense </td> <td>48,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,744 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense </td> <td>14,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,243 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total R&D expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(55,847) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nR&D expenses decreased by $55.8 million, to $136.7 million, in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to $192.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease reflects a reduction in clinical study costs as a result of the wind down of our Phase 3 LIBERTY, HERO, and SPIRIT studies and cost reimbursements from Pfizer for certain R&D expenses (See Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). This decrease was partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses mainly driven by the continued expansion of our medical affairs organization in preparation for the U.S. commercial launch of ORGOVYX and the potential U.S. commercial launches of relugolix combination tablet, if approved, as well as regulatory expenses and submission fees.\nR&D expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 consisted primarily of program-specific costs composed of CRO, drug supply and other study, regulatory, and manufacturing related costs of $60.1 million, which includes fees related to our NDA submissions for ORGOVYX and relugolix combination tablet for uterine fibroids of $5.8 million, personnel expenses of $48.5 million, share-based compensation expense of $14.0 million, and other R&D costs of $14.1 million, which primarily includes contractors, consultants, and information technology costs and other unallocated nonclinical research costs. R&D expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 are presented net of approximately $13.9 million of cost share reimbursement from Pfizer.\nR&D expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of program-specific costs composed of CRO, drug supply, regulatory, and manufacturing related costs of $133.4 million, personnel expenses of $32.7 million, share-based compensation expense of $14.5 million, and other R&D costs of $11.9 million, which primarily includes contractors, consultants, and information technology costs. The share-based compensation expense includes $1.8 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards as a result of a change in control of Myovant in connection with the closing of the Sumitomo-Roivant Transaction (see Note 6(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased by $99.1 million, to $181.4 million, in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to $82.3 million in the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to higher expenses related to commercial activities to support the ORGOVYX U.S. commercial launch and the potential U.S. commercial launches of relugolix combination tablet as well as higher personnel-related expenses primarily due to the hiring of our commercial operations, marketing, and market access teams, and our oncology sales force, higher share-based compensation expense primarily as a result of the acceleration, modification, and remeasurement of our former Principal Executive Officer's equity awards (see Note 10(H) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and general overhead expenses to support our organizational growth.\nSG&A expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 consisted primarily of personnel expenses of $56.4 million, commercial operations expenses of $43.8 million, general overhead, administrative and information technology expenses of $24.6 million, shared-based compensation expense of $39.6 million (which includes approximately $25.7 million related to the acceleration, modification and remeasurement of our former Principal Executive Officer's equity awards as discussed further in Note 10(H) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), professional service fees of $9.0 million, and rent and other facilities-related costs of $3.5 million. For the year ended March 31, 2021, we also incurred related party expenses of $5.3 million pursuant to our agreements with Sunovion and Sumitovant. For additional information about these related party expenses, see Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. SG&A expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 are presented net of approximately $10.9 million of cost share reimbursement from Pfizer.\nSG&A expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of share-based compensation expense of $25.7 million, personnel expenses of $19.1 million, commercial operations expenses of $12.7 million, general overhead, administrative and information technology expenses of $11.9 million, professional service fees of $6.0 million, a capital tax accrual of $3.6 million, and rent and other facilities-related costs of $2.8 million. The share-based compensation expense includes $10.2 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards as a result of a change in control of Myovant in connection with the closing of the Sumitomo-Roivant Transaction (see Note 6(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $10.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2021 and was primarily related to the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, compared to $12.7 million in the year ended March 31, 2020 primarily related to our previously outstanding financing arrangements with NovaQuest and Hercules. The decrease in interest expense, despite higher outstanding loan balances, was primarily driven by the significantly lower interest rates associated with the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement as compared to the previously outstanding debt obligations to NovaQuest and Hercules, which were repaid in December 2019. Interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2021 also includes $0.6 million of accretion of the financing component of the cost share advance from Pfizer (see Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). There was no such accretion for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nThere was no loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended March 31, 2021. For the year ended March 31, 2020, we incurred a $4.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts, prepayment penalties and early redemption fees in connection with the repayment of our outstanding obligations to NovaQuest and Hercules.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was approximately $0.2 million and $2.6 million for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Gain\nForeign exchange gain consists of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign exchange denominated liabilities. The impact of foreign exchange rates on our results of operations fluctuated period over period based on our foreign currency exposures resulting from changes in applicable exchange rates associated with our foreign denominated liabilities. For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a foreign exchange gain of $16.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The $14.6 million increase in foreign exchange gains in the year ended March 31, 2021 was primarily the result of the increase in our outstanding balance under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement and the impact of fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur income tax expense was $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was (0.13)% and (0.26)%, respectively, and is driven by our jurisdictional earnings by location and a valuation allowance that eliminates our global net deferred tax assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our common shares, from debt financing arrangements, and more recently from upfront and milestone payments we received from Richter and Pfizer. We began generating product revenue, net from the sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. in January 2021.\nAs of March 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement of $726.2 million, consisting of $684.9 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $41.3 million of borrowing capacity available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, as compared to cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement of $365.9 million, consisting of $79.6 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $286.3 million of borrowing capacity available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, as of March 31, 2020. Additional funds under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement may be drawn down by us no more than once per calendar quarter, subject to certain terms and conditions, including consent of our board of directors.\nPursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $3.7 billion of additional milestone payments, including two regulatory milestones of $100.0 million upon each FDA approval for relugolix combination tablet in uterine fibroids and endometriosis ($200.0 million in the aggregate), and tiered sales milestones of up to $3.5 billion upon reaching certain thresholds of annual net sales for oncology and the combined women's health indications in the Co-Promotion Territory. We and Pfizer will equally share profits and certain expenses in the Co-Promotion Territory. In addition, if Pfizer exercises its option to acquire exclusive commercialization and development rights to relugolix in oncology in the Pfizer Territory, we will receive an option exercise fee of $50.0 million and will also be eligible to receive double-digit royalties on net sales of relugolix in the Pfizer Territory.\nPursuant to the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $137.5 million of additional milestone payments, including regulatory milestones of up to $30.0 million and tiered sales milestones of up to $107.5 million upon reaching certain thresholds of annual net sales for relugolix combination tablet in Richter's territory, and tiered royalties on net sales following regulatory approval for relugolix combination tablet in Richter's territory.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, we issued and sold common shares under our sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen\u201d) to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million from time to time through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program under which Cowen was our agent. During the year ended March 31, 2020, we sold common shares under this agreement for aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $2.5 million after deducting underwriting commissions and offering costs paid by us. No common shares were sold under the sales agreement during the year ended March 31, 2021. The at-the-market\u201d equity offering program expired in March 2021.\nCapital Requirements\nFor the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net losses of $255.1 million and $289.0 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.0 billion. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately $684.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We currently believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This estimate is based on our current assumptions, including assumptions related to our ability to manage our spend, that might prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In future periods, if our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts that we expect to generate from product sales and/or third-party collaboration payments, are not sufficient to enable us to fund our operations, we may need to raise additional funds in the form of equity, debt, or from other sources. In addition, we may choose to raise additional funds in the form of equity, debt, or from other sources due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current and future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our common shareholders' ownership interest may experience substantial dilution, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our common shareholders' rights. The Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement involves, and any agreements for future debt or preferred equity financings, if available, may involve, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, raising capital through equity offerings, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nWe expect our operating expenses, net of costs that are expected to be shared with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, to increase as we commercialize ORGOVYX in the U.S., prepare for the potential regulatory approvals and commercialization of relugolix combination tablet, initiate life cycle management activities for our relugolix\nfranchise, and potentially further develop our other product candidates and expand our pipeline. We expect our net cash burn to gradually decrease as our net revenues increase but our future capital requirements and operating expenses are expected to continue to be significant. Our operating expenses and operating cash flows may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the price, level of demand and net revenues generated from commercial sales of ORGOVYX and from any other product candidates that may receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the achievement of regulatory milestones, sales milestones, and royalties that we are eligible to earn pursuant to the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement and the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement;\n\u2022the timing, shared costs, and level of investment in our and our collaboration partners' activities related to sales, marketing, market access, manufacturing, and distribution for ORGOVYX and for any other product candidates that may receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the timing, shared costs, and level of investment in our and our collaboration partners' research and development activities involving ORGOVYX, relugolix monotherapy tablet, relugolix combination tablet, and any other product candidates;\n\u2022costs, timing, and outcomes of regulatory submissions and regulatory reviews of our product candidates;\n\u2022costs to expand our chemistry, manufacturing, and control and other manufacturing related activities;\n\u2022costs to identify, acquire, develop, and commercialize additional product candidates;\n\u2022costs to integrate acquired technologies into a comprehensive regulatory and product development strategy;\n\u2022costs to maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022costs to hire additional commercial operations, sales, scientific, clinical, regulatory, quality, and other personnel to support our commercialization, regulatory, and clinical development efforts;\n\u2022costs to implement or enhance operational, accounting, finance, quality, commercial, and management information systems;\n\u2022costs to service our debt obligations and associated interest payments; and\n\u2022costs to operate as a public company.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial net product revenue from sales of ORGOVYX, relugolix combination tablet, MVT-602, or any future product candidate, we expect to fund our operations through a combination of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities currently on hand and amounts available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, subject to the consent of our board of directors, as well as potential payments we are eligible to receive from Pfizer and Richter pursuant to the terms of our agreements with them.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>370,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(221,172) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,211) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,935) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,926 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, $370.6 million of cash was provided by operating activities, which was primarily driven by a net increase in deferred revenue of $457.9 million and a net increase in cost share advance from collaboration partner of $121.2 million, both of which were largely driven by the upfront payment received from Pfizer in December 2020 discussed previously. For the year ended March 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities also included an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $15.6 million (primarily due to an increase in accrued commercial and compensation-related expenses partially offset by a decrease in accrued R&D expenses), as well as $53.7 million of non-cash share-based\ncompensation expense (which includes approximately $25.7 million related to the acceleration, modification and remeasurement of our former Principal Executive Officer's equity awards). These items were partially offset by a net loss for the period of $255.1 million primarily due to our ongoing development and clinical studies, and activities related to our preparation for potential regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product candidates, and the expansion of our company, and a non-cash foreign currency transaction gain of $16.2 million primarily related to amounts outstanding under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Agreement.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, we used $221.2 million of cash in operating activities primarily due to our ongoing clinical studies, activities related to our preparation for potential regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product candidates, and the expansion of our company. This was primarily attributable to a net loss for the period of $289.0 million and a decrease of $24.7 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulting primarily from a decrease in accrued R&D expenses and decreases of $1.1 million in interest payable and $2.3 million in deferred interest payable related to our previously outstanding debt which was repaid in full on December 31, 2019. These amounts were partially offset by an increase of $40.0 million in deferred revenue related to the upfront payment we received from Richter on March 31, 2020, an increase in accounts payable of $4.3 million, due to timing of invoice payments, and an increase in other liabilities of $3.6 million, due to a capital tax accrual as a result of the change in control in Myovant, along with non-cash items including $40.3 million of share-based compensation expense as a result of an increase in headcount (which also includes $12.0 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards as a result of the change in control in Myovant in connection with the closing of the transaction between Roivant and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma), $3.3 million of total depreciation, amortization and non-cash interest expense, and a $4.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts, prepayment penalties and early redemption fees in connection with the repayment of outstanding obligations to NovaQuest and Hercules on December 31, 2019.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, we used $9.2 million of cash in investing activities, of which $7.4 million was for the purchase of marketable securities, net of maturities and sales, and $1.8 million was for the purchase of property and equipment.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, we used $3.9 million of cash in investing activities, of which $2.8 million was for the purchase of marketable securities, net of maturities, and $1.1 million was for the purchase of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, $238.0 million of cash was provided by financing activities. This was primarily due to proceeds of $245.0 million borrowed under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement and proceeds of $6.7 million from the exercise of stock options under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, partially offset by payment of tax withholdings on net settlement of share awards of $13.7 million.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, $145.9 million of cash was provided by financing activities. This was primarily due to the net proceeds of $137.0 million we received from issuances of our common shares, which included $134.5 million from the issuance and sale of 17,424,243 common shares in our underwritten public equity offering and $2.5 million from the sale of 106,494 common shares through our at-the-market\u201d equity offering program, and proceeds of $113.7 million borrowed under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement. In addition, we received proceeds of $0.9 million from the exercise of stock options under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. These amounts were partially offset by the repayment of our financing obligations and redemption fees to NovaQuest and Hercules, including payments to NovaQuest of $60.0 million for repayment of principal, early redemption fee of $2.4 million, and an annual debt administration fee of $0.3 million, and payments to Hercules of $40.0 million for repayment of principal, a prepayment penalty of $0.4 million, and an end-of-term charge of $2.6 million.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table provides information with respect to our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2021 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future years (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related party debt obligations, including interest charge (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>402,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,672 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>367,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>14,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,891 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>416 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>416,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>372,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>416 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Related party debt obligations, including interest charge consists of principal and future interest payments due to Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma pursuant to the terms of the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement based on the amounts outstanding at March 31, 2021 and the interest rate in effect at March 31, 2021. See Note 6(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(2) Operating lease obligations consist of future rent payments under lease and sublease agreements for office space located in Brisbane, California. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLicense Agreement with Takeda\nIn connection with the Takeda License Agreement, we are required to pay Takeda a fixed, high single-digit royalty on net sales of relugolix and MVT-602 products in our territory. We cannot, at this time, determine when or if royalty payments will be required or what the total amount of such payments may be. Therefore, such payments are not included in the table above. See Note 14(D) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContract Service Providers\nWe have entered into agreements with certain vendors for the provision of goods and services, which includes manufacturing services with CMOs and development services with respect to CROs. These agreements may include certain provisions for purchase obligations and termination obligations that could require payment for the cancellation of committed purchase obligations or for early termination of the agreements. The amounts of the cancellation or termination payments vary and are based on the timing of the cancellation or termination and the specific terms of the agreements and are considered cancellable contracts. These cancellable contracts are not included in the table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these audited consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingencies as of the dates of the audited consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, or experience. Changes in estimates and assumptions are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.\nWe believe that the estimates derived from the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. We define our critical accounting policies as those under U.S. GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and we believe that our estimates and judgments relating to\ncollaboration arrangements, revenue recognition, and R&D expenses and accruals have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, refer to Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies.\nCollaboration Arrangements\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by the parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple units of account, we first determine which units of account of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nWhile ASC 808 defines collaborative arrangements and provides guidance on the income statement presentation, classification, and disclosures related to such arrangements, it does not address recognition and measurement matters, such as (1) determining the appropriate unit of account or (2) when the recognition criteria are met. Therefore, the accounting for these arrangements is either based on an analogy to other accounting literature, such as ASC 606, or an accounting policy election by management. For units of account within the collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate revenue recognition method is determined and applied consistently.\nAmounts we receive prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue on the audited consolidated balance sheets. If the related efforts underlying the deferred revenue are expected to be satisfied within the next twelve months, the deferred revenue is classified in current liabilities, otherwise it is classified as a non-current liability.\nFor collaboration arrangements that are within the scope of ASC 808, the recognition of collaboration revenue (expense) requires management judgement due to the fact that the terms of collaboration arrangements may be complicated, and the nature of the collaborative activities may change over time. Management judgement is exercised in determining the units of account within a collaboration arrangement and in allocating consideration to those units, estimating the collaboration revenue to be recognized, including estimating an appropriate term over which the collaboration revenue is expected to be recognized, as well as in determining the amortization method. For example, judgement is required in identifying material rights and performance obligations, and in estimating the stand-alone selling price of identified performance obligations and material rights, the estimates of which may include forecasted revenue, development timelines, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\nThere is also judgement involved in the identification of costs that we incur related to the collaboration activities, evaluating the nature of these costs (for example, whether the costs relate to a particular geography or territory or whether the costs relate to clinical or commercial activities), and applying the terms of the respective collaborative arrangement to determine the portion of such costs that are the responsibility of the collaboration partner, which in certain circumstances requires significant judgement.\nIn addition, we are dependent on collaborative partners to provide us with information in a timely and accurate manner for use in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Certain of this information may also be subject to estimates. Should our collaborative partners fail to provide us with any such information in a timely manner, or should any estimates upon which such financial information was based, prove to be inaccurate, we could be required to record such adjustments in future periods.\nRevenue Recognition\nProduct Revenue, Net\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when physical control of our product is transferred to our customers, who are specialty distributors and pharmacies. Product sales are recorded net of various forms of variable consideration, including estimated (a) invoice discounts for prompt payment and specialty distributor and specialty pharmacy service fees, (b) government and private payer rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, (c) group purchasing organization (GPO) discounts, performance rebates and administrative fees, (d) product returns and (e) costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients (collectively, sales deductions\u201d).\nThe variability in the net transaction price for our product arises primarily from the aforementioned sales deductions. Significant judgment is required in estimating certain sales deductions. In making these estimates, we consider our historical\nexperience, product price increases or decreases, current contractual and statutory requirements, unbilled claims, processing time lags for claims, inventory levels in the distribution channel, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in net product revenue only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results vary from our estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\nLicense, Milestone, and Other Revenue\nFor units of account under ASC 606, we apply significant judgment when evaluating whether contractual obligations represent distinct performance obligations, allocating transaction price to performance obligations within a contract, determining when performance obligations have been met, assessing the recognition and future reversal of variable consideration, and determining and applying appropriate methods of measuring progress for performance obligations satisfied over time. These judgements are discussed in more detail below:\n\u2022Licenses of intellectual property: If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are not distinct from other promises, we apply judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the related revenue recognition accordingly.\n\u2022Milestone payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes research, development or regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price on a cumulative catch-up basis in earnings in the period of the adjustment.\n\u2022Royalties and commercial milestone payments: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including commercial milestone payments based on pre-specified level of sales, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Achievement of these royalties and commercial milestones may solely depend upon performance of the licensee.\nResearch and Development Expenses and Accruals\nR&D expenses primarily include personnel-related costs for employees engaged in R&D activities and costs of third-parties who conduct clinical study and clinical manufacturing activities on our behalf, and are expensed as incurred unless there is an alternative future use in other R&D projects. Payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product and payments for milestones achieved prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred as R&D.\nWe consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain and products manufactured prior to regulatory approval may not be sold unless regulatory approval is obtained. As such, the manufacturing costs for product candidates incurred prior to regulatory approval are not capitalized as inventory, but rather expensed as R&D expenses when incurred.\nOur accruals for clinical studies and other R&D activities are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical study sites, CROs, and CMOs. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee, unit price, upon achievement of a milestone event, or on a time and materials basis. Payments under these agreements depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, the successful enrollment of patients, and the completion of portions of the clinical study or similar conditions. The objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our audited consolidated financial statements to the actual services received and efforts\nexpended. As such, expense accruals related to clinical studies and other R&D activities are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the agreements.\nOur accrual estimates are dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by third parties regarding the status and cost of studies, and may not match the actual services performed by these organizations. During the course of a clinical study, we adjust our rate of clinical study expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our clinical study expense as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known at that time. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. This could result in adjustment to our R&D expense in future periods.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding the impact of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "While ASC 808 defines collaborative arrangements and provides guidance on the income statement presentation, classification, and disclosures related to such arrangements, it does not address recognition and measurement matters, such as (1) determining the appropriate unit of account or (2) when the recognition criteria are met.

We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the related revenue recognition accordingly.\nOur interest expense through December 31, 2019 consists of interest expense related to our previously outstanding debt with Hercules Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d) and NovaQuest Capital Management ( NovaQuest\u201d), which we repaid on December 31, 2019, as well as the associated non-cash amortization of related debt discounts and issuance costs.

Achievement of these royalties and commercial milestones may solely depend upon performance of the licensee.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, we issued and sold common shares under our sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen\u201d) to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million from time to time through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program under which Cowen was our agent. During the year ended March 31, 2020, we sold common shares under this agreement for aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $2.5 million after deducting underwriting commissions and offering costs paid by us. No common shares were sold under the sales agreement during the year ended March 31, 2021. The at-the-market\u201d equity offering program expired in March 2021.\nIn December 2020, we changed the functional currency of our wholly-owned subsidiary in Switzerland, MSG, from the Swiss franc to the U.S. dollar.

Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results vary from our estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\n\u2022Milestone payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes research, development or regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method.

Significant judgment is required in estimating certain sales deductions. In making these estimates, we consider our historical\nR&D expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 consisted primarily of program-specific costs composed of CRO, drug supply and other study, regulatory, and manufacturing related costs of $60.1 million, which includes fees related to our NDA submissions for ORGOVYX and relugolix combination tablet for uterine fibroids of $5.8 million, personnel expenses of $48.5 million, share-based compensation expense of $14.0 million, and other R&D costs of $14.1 million, which primarily includes contractors, consultants, and information technology costs and other unallocated nonclinical research costs. R&D expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 are presented net of approximately $13.9 million of cost share reimbursement from Pfizer.\n\u2022On April 12, 2021, we and Pfizer announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase 3 single-arm, open-label SERENE study evaluating the contraceptive efficacy of relugolix combination tablet in healthy women ages 18-35 years who are at risk for pregnancy.\n\u2022As of March 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $684.9 million. We currently believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022In December 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer under which we and Pfizer will jointly develop and commercialize relugolix in oncology and women's health and equally share profits and certain expenses, in the U.S. and Canada (the Co-Promotion Territory\u201d). In December 2020, we received a $650.0 million upfront payment and we are eligible to receive up to $3.7 billion of additional milestone payments, including two regulatory milestones of $100.0 million upon each FDA approval for relugolix combination tablet in uterine fibroids and endometriosis ($200.0 million in the aggregate), and tiered sales milestones of up to $3.5 billion upon reaching certain thresholds of annual net sales for oncology and the combined women's health indications in the Co-Promotion Territory. We granted Pfizer an exclusive option to acquire development and commercialization rights to relugolix in oncology outside of the Co-Promotion Territory (excluding certain Asian markets). If Pfizer exercises this option, we will receive an additional $50.0 million payment and will be eligible to receive double-digit royalties on net sales. Pfizer's decision is expected in mid-calendar year 2021.\nInterest income was approximately $0.2 million and $2.6 million for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in interest rates.\n\nR&D expenses decreased by $55.8 million, to $136.7 million, in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to $192.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease reflects a reduction in clinical study costs as a result of the wind down of our Phase 3 LIBERTY, HERO, and SPIRIT studies and cost reimbursements from Pfizer for certain R&D expenses (See Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). This decrease was partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses mainly driven by the continued expansion of our medical affairs organization in preparation for the U.S. commercial launch of ORGOVYX and the potential U.S. commercial launches of relugolix combination tablet, if approved, as well as regulatory expenses and submission fees.\nR&D expenses primarily include personnel-related costs for employees engaged in R&D activities and costs of third-parties who conduct clinical study and clinical manufacturing activities on our behalf, and are expensed as incurred unless there is an alternative future use in other R&D projects. Payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product and payments for milestones achieved prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred as R&D.\n\u2022costs to maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\nPursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $3.7 billion of additional milestone payments, including two regulatory milestones of $100.0 million upon each FDA approval for relugolix combination tablet in uterine fibroids and endometriosis ($200.0 million in the aggregate), and tiered sales milestones of up to $3.5 billion upon reaching certain thresholds of annual net sales for oncology and the combined women's health indications in the Co-Promotion Territory. We and Pfizer will equally share profits and certain expenses in the Co-Promotion Territory. In addition, if Pfizer exercises its option to acquire exclusive commercialization and development rights to relugolix in oncology in the Pfizer Territory, we will receive an option exercise fee of $50.0 million and will also be eligible to receive double-digit royalties on net sales of relugolix in the Pfizer Territory.\n\u2022costs to expand our chemistry, manufacturing, and control and other manufacturing related activities;\n\u2022costs, timing, and outcomes of regulatory submissions and regulatory reviews of our product candidates;\nFor information regarding the impact of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere is also judgement involved in the identification of costs that we incur related to the collaboration activities, evaluating the nature of these costs (for example, whether the costs relate to a particular geography or territory or whether the costs relate to clinical or commercial activities), and applying the terms of the respective collaborative arrangement to determine the portion of such costs that are the responsibility of the collaboration partner, which in certain circumstances requires significant judgement.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, our collaboration expense to Pfizer was $1.7 million and represents Pfizer's 50% share of net profits from the sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\u2022ORGOVYX became commercially available through authorized specialty distributors in the U.S. in early January 2021. Our oncology sales force began promoting ORGOVYX to target prescribers in early January 2021 and the uro-oncology sales force of our collaboration partner, Pfizer, began actively promoting ORGOVYX to target prescribers in early February 2021.\nIn this section, we summarize certain of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and recent clinical, regulatory, and corporate updates. Additional information about our business, our approved product, and our product candidates is included in Part I. Item 1., Business,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nexpended. As such, expense accruals related to clinical studies and other R&D activities are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the agreements.\nCapital Requirements\nInterest Income\n\u2022the timing, shared costs, and level of investment in our and our collaboration partners' research and development activities involving ORGOVYX, relugolix monotherapy tablet, relugolix combination tablet, and any other product candidates;\nInvesting Activities\nFor collaboration arrangements that are within the scope of ASC 808, the recognition of collaboration revenue (expense) requires management judgement due to the fact that the terms of collaboration arrangements may be complicated, and the nature of the collaborative activities may change over time. Management judgement is exercised in determining the units of account within a collaboration arrangement and in allocating consideration to those units, estimating the collaboration revenue to be recognized, including estimating an appropriate term over which the collaboration revenue is expected to be recognized, as well as in determining the amortization method. For example, judgement is required in identifying material rights and performance obligations, and in estimating the stand-alone selling price of identified performance obligations and material rights, the estimates of which may include forecasted revenue, development timelines, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\n\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our common shares, from debt financing arrangements, and more recently from upfront and milestone payments we received from Richter and Pfizer. We began generating product revenue, net from the sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. in January 2021.\n\u2022In August 2020, we entered into a three-year commercial collaboration agreement with Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Sunovion\u201d). Under the agreement, Sunovion will provide certain third-party logistics, trade and retail distribution, contract operations, and market access account management services, and other services to us and, Sunovion will become a non-exclusive distributor of relugolix for prostate cancer and the exclusive distributor of relugolix combination tablet for uterine fibroids and endometriosis in the U.S.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, we used $221.2 million of cash in operating activities primarily due to our ongoing clinical studies, activities related to our preparation for potential regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product candidates, and the expansion of our company. This was primarily attributable to a net loss for the period of $289.0 million and a decrease of $24.7 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulting primarily from a decrease in accrued R&D expenses and decreases of $1.1 million in interest payable and $2.3 million in deferred interest payable related to our previously outstanding debt which was repaid in full on December 31, 2019. These amounts were partially offset by an increase of $40.0 million in deferred revenue related to the upfront payment we received from Richter on March 31, 2020, an increase in accounts payable of $4.3 million, due to timing of invoice payments, and an increase in other liabilities of $3.6 million, due to a capital tax accrual as a result of the change in control in Myovant, along with non-cash items including $40.3 million of share-based compensation expense as a result of an increase in headcount (which also includes $12.0 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards as a result of the change in control in Myovant in connection with the closing of the transaction between Roivant and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma), $3.3 million of total depreciation, amortization and non-cash interest expense, and a $4.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts, prepayment penalties and early redemption fees in connection with the repayment of outstanding obligations to NovaQuest and Hercules on December 31, 2019.\n\u2022FDA decision for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of uterine fibroids expected by the June 1, 2021 target action date. If approved, we and Pfizer expect to launch relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of uterine fibroids in the U.S. in June 2021. Upon approval, we will receive a $100.0 million regulatory milestone payment from Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement.\nCost of Product Revenue\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section generally discusses the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 items and comparisons between these fiscal years. Discussions of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 items and comparisons between the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Item 7 of Part II, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on May 18, 2020.\nOur program-specific costs primarily include third-party costs, which include expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and CMOs, the cost of consultants who assist with the development of our product candidates on a program-specific basis, investigator grants, sponsored research, manufacturing costs in connection with producing materials for use in conducting nonclinical and clinical studies, as well as costs related to pre-commercial manufacturing activities and regulatory submissions, and other third-party expenses directly attributable to the development of our product candidates.\nSG&A expenses increased by $99.1 million, to $181.4 million, in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to $82.3 million in the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to higher expenses related to commercial activities to support the ORGOVYX U.S. commercial launch and the potential U.S. commercial launches of relugolix combination tablet as well as higher personnel-related expenses primarily due to the hiring of our commercial operations, marketing, and market access teams, and our oncology sales force, higher share-based compensation expense primarily as a result of the acceleration, modification, and remeasurement of our former Principal Executive Officer's equity awards (see Note 10(H) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and general overhead expenses to support our organizational growth.\n\u2022the achievement of regulatory milestones, sales milestones, and royalties that we are eligible to earn pursuant to the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement and the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement;\nfranchise, and potentially further develop our other product candidates and expand our pipeline. We expect our net cash burn to gradually decrease as our net revenues increase but our future capital requirements and operating expenses are expected to continue to be significant. Our operating expenses and operating cash flows may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nSources of Liquidity\nOur collaboration expense to Pfizer consists of Pfizer's 50% share of net profits from sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\n\u2022On December 18, 2020, the FDA approved ORGOVYX for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. ORGOVYX, which was granted Priority Review by the FDA, is the first and only oral GnRH receptor antagonist for men with advanced prostate cancer.\nLicense, Milestone, and Other Revenue\nAs of March 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement of $726.2 million, consisting of $684.9 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $41.3 million of borrowing capacity available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, as compared to cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement of $365.9 million, consisting of $79.6 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $286.3 million of borrowing capacity available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, as of March 31, 2020. Additional funds under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement may be drawn down by us no more than once per calendar quarter, subject to certain terms and conditions, including consent of our board of directors.\nResearch and Development Expenses and Accruals\nPursuant to the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $137.5 million of additional milestone payments, including regulatory milestones of up to $30.0 million and tiered sales milestones of up to $107.5 million upon reaching certain thresholds of annual net sales for relugolix combination tablet in Richter's territory, and tiered royalties on net sales following regulatory approval for relugolix combination tablet in Richter's territory.\nUterine Fibroids (LIBERTY Program)\n\u2022In May 2020, efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 HERO study were simultaneously published online in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO\u201d)'s ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program.\ncollaboration arrangements, revenue recognition, and R&D expenses and accruals have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, refer to Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies.\nContractual Obligations\nEndometriosis (SPIRIT Program)\nProduct and Product Candidates\nOur revenues to date have been generated substantially from the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement and the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, which are further discussed in Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We began commercializing ORGOVYX in the U.S. for adult patients with advanced prostate cancer in January 2021.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, $370.6 million of cash was provided by operating activities, which was primarily driven by a net increase in deferred revenue of $457.9 million and a net increase in cost share advance from collaboration partner of $121.2 million, both of which were largely driven by the upfront payment received from Pfizer in December 2020 discussed previously. For the year ended March 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities also included an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $15.6 million (primarily due to an increase in accrued commercial and compensation-related expenses partially offset by a decrease in accrued R&D expenses), as well as $53.7 million of non-cash share-based\nIn connection with the Takeda License Agreement, we are required to pay Takeda a fixed, high single-digit royalty on net sales of relugolix and MVT-602 products in our territory. We cannot, at this time, determine when or if royalty payments will be required or what the total amount of such payments may be. Therefore, such payments are not included in the table above. See Note 14(D) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nR&D activities have been, and will continue to be, central to our business model. We currently expect R&D expenses for the year ending March 31, 2022, to be modestly lower than the R&D expenses incurred in the year ended March 31, 2021, largely due to our sharing of certain expenses with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Overall, we expect declining spend on our Phase 3 clinical programs that are winding down to be offset primarily by incremental spend on new relugolix development programs, such as the Phase 3 SERENE study, to potentially expand the commercial opportunity for the relugolix franchise.\nIn connection with the FDA approval of ORGOVYX on December 18, 2020, we subsequently began capitalizing inventory manufactured or purchased after this date. As a result, we expensed certain manufacturing costs of ORGOVYX as R&D expenses prior to FDA approval and, therefore, these costs are not included in cost of goods sold.\nOur unallocated R&D costs primarily include employee-related expenses, such as salaries, share-based compensation, fringe benefits and travel for employees engaged in R&D activities including clinical operations, biostatistics, regulatory, and medical affairs, and the cost of contractors and consultants who assist with R&D activities not specific to a program and costs associated with nonclinical studies.\nContract Service Providers\nWe expect that certain R&D expenses will be shared equally with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, we used $9.2 million of cash in investing activities, of which $7.4 million was for the purchase of marketable securities, net of maturities and sales, and $1.8 million was for the purchase of property and equipment.\nsold during for the year ended March 31, 2021 as these costs were previously recorded as R&D expenses. We expect our cost of goods sold to increase in future periods as quantities of zero-cost ORGOVYX inventory are depleted from our inventory stock.\n\u2022On March 24, 2021, we and Pfizer announced positive safety and efficacy data from the LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study.\nThe following table provides information with respect to our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2021 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future years (in thousands):\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic resulting from the disease known as COVID-19 caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-Co V-2. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed essential,\u201d isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing when engaging in essential activities. In certain countries, and in certain states within the U.S., such orders have been lifted, although recent trends in COVID-19 infections have led to the reinstatement of such orders in various jurisdictions. It remains unclear how long these measures will remain in place and whether these measures will be effective. Further, recently it has been reported that the rate of the reported number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is increasing, and new more virulent variants of the coronavirus have been identified, which may further impact the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on us.\n(2) Operating lease obligations consist of future rent payments under lease and sublease agreements for office space located in Brisbane, California. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCollaboration Arrangements\nSG&A expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 consisted primarily of personnel expenses of $56.4 million, commercial operations expenses of $43.8 million, general overhead, administrative and information technology expenses of $24.6 million, shared-based compensation expense of $39.6 million (which includes approximately $25.7 million related to the acceleration, modification and remeasurement of our former Principal Executive Officer's equity awards as discussed further in Note 10(H) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), professional service fees of $9.0 million, and rent and other facilities-related costs of $3.5 million. For the year ended March 31, 2021, we also incurred related party expenses of $5.3 million pursuant to our agreements with Sunovion and Sumitovant. For additional information about these related party expenses, see Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. SG&A expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 are presented net of approximately $10.9 million of cost share reimbursement from Pfizer.\nResults of Operations\nLicense Agreement with Takeda\nOur license and milestone revenue represents the partial recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with upfront and regulatory milestone payments we received from Richter pursuant to the terms of the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement (see Note 13(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We recognize revenue as we satisfy our combined performance obligation to Richter.\nIn an effort to protect the safety of our employees and our patients, we adopted safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that meet or exceed the guidelines established by government and public health officials. These measures include adopting policies applicable to office-based employees such as working from home, limiting the number of employees on site, and limiting business travel. At this time, we have not identified a material change to our productivity as a result of these measures, but this could change, particularly if restricted travel, closed schools, and shelter-in-place orders are not removed or significantly eased.\nExpected Upcoming Clinical and Regulatory Milestones\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended March 31, 2021 represents the partial amortization of the upfront payment received from Pfizer pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement. There were no such amounts recognized for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nOur majority shareholder is Sumitovant Biopharma Ltd. ( Sumitovant\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. ( Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma\u201d). As of March 31, 2021, Sumitovant directly, and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma indirectly, own 48,641,181, or approximately 53.5%, of our outstanding common shares.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on redefining care for women and for men through purpose-driven science, empowering medicines, and transformative advocacy. ORGOVYXTM (relugolix) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) in 2020 as the first and only oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH\u201d) receptor antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix is also under regulatory review in Europe for men with advanced prostate cancer. In addition, relugolix combination tablet (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) is under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe for women with uterine fibroids, has completed Phase 3 registration-enabling studies for women with endometriosis, and is being assessed for contraceptive efficacy in healthy women ages 18-35 years who are at risk for pregnancy. We are also developing MVT-602, an oligopeptide kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist, which has completed a Phase 2a study for the treatment of female infertility as a part of assisted reproduction.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, our cost of product revenue was $0.3 million, which includes the cost of goods sold and royalty expense payable to Takeda pursuant to the Takeda License Agreement (see Note 14(D) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, we used $3.9 million of cash in investing activities, of which $2.8 million was for the purchase of marketable securities, net of maturities, and $1.1 million was for the purchase of property and equipment.\n\u2022On January 4, 2021, we announced the appointment of David Marek as Chief Executive Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc. Concurrent with this appointment, Mr. Marek was also appointed as Principal Executive Officer of Myovant Sciences Ltd. and as a member of our board of directors. Mr. Marek succeeds Dr. Lynn Seely, who previously held these positions.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial net product revenue from sales of ORGOVYX, relugolix combination tablet, MVT-602, or any future product candidate, we expect to fund our operations through a combination of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities currently on hand and amounts available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, subject to the consent of our board of directors, as well as potential payments we are eligible to receive from Pfizer and Richter pursuant to the terms of our agreements with them.\nFor the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net losses of $255.1 million and $289.0 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.0 billion. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately $684.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We currently believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This estimate is based on our current assumptions, including assumptions related to our ability to manage our spend, that might prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In future periods, if our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts that we expect to generate from product sales and/or third-party collaboration payments, are not sufficient to enable us to fund our operations, we may need to raise additional funds in the form of equity, debt, or from other sources. In addition, we may choose to raise additional funds in the form of equity, debt, or from other sources due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current and future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our common shareholders' ownership interest may experience substantial dilution, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our common shareholders' rights. The Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement involves, and any agreements for future debt or preferred equity financings, if available, may involve, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, raising capital through equity offerings, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\n\u2022In February 2021, we and our collaboration partner, Pfizer, announced publication in the New England Journal of Medicine of the Phase 3 LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies of investigational once-daily relugolix combination therapy in women with uterine fibroids.\n(1) Related party debt obligations, including interest charge consists of principal and future interest payments due to Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma pursuant to the terms of the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement based on the amounts outstanding at March 31, 2021 and the interest rate in effect at March 31, 2021. See Note 6(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nForeign exchange gain consists of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign exchange denominated liabilities. The impact of foreign exchange rates on our results of operations fluctuated period over period based on our foreign currency exposures resulting from changes in applicable exchange rates associated with our foreign denominated liabilities. For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a foreign exchange gain of $16.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The $14.6 million increase in foreign exchange gains in the year ended March 31, 2021 was primarily the result of the increase in our outstanding balance under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement and the impact of fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nWe have taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions, in our approach to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state, and local public health authorities and may take additional action based on their recommendations. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our financial results, our clinical studies, our supply chains, our commercial launch for ORGOVYX, and pre-launch commercial readiness activities for relugolix combination tablet, end user demand for our products, if approved, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot estimate the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Refer to the risk factor titled Business interruptions resulting from effects of pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition,\u201d as well as other risk factors included in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d set forth in Part I. Item 1A.\nAmounts we receive prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue on the audited consolidated balance sheets. If the related efforts underlying the deferred revenue are expected to be satisfied within the next twelve months, the deferred revenue is classified in current liabilities, otherwise it is classified as a non-current liability.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe expect our operating expenses, net of costs that are expected to be shared with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, to increase as we commercialize ORGOVYX in the U.S., prepare for the potential regulatory approvals and commercialization of relugolix combination tablet, initiate life cycle management activities for our relugolix\n\u2022European Commission decision on the advanced prostate cancer MAA expected in calendar year 2022.\nCollaboration Expense to Pfizer\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, $238.0 million of cash was provided by financing activities. This was primarily due to proceeds of $245.0 million borrowed under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement and proceeds of $6.7 million from the exercise of stock options under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, partially offset by payment of tax withholdings on net settlement of share awards of $13.7 million.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOperating Activities\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these audited consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingencies as of the dates of the audited consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, or experience. Changes in estimates and assumptions are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.\nRevenues\nForeign Exchange Gain\nOur SG&A expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, sales incentive compensation, bonuses, fringe benefits, and share-based compensation expenses for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, commercial operations, marketing, market access, sales, and other administrative functions. Our SG&A expenses also include marketing programs, advertising, conferences, congresses, travel expenses, professional fees for legal, accounting, auditing and tax services, and costs related to rent and facilities, insurance, information technology, commercial operations, and general overhead. Our SG&A expenses also include costs incurred under our Market Access Services Agreement with Sunovion and our former consulting agreement with Sumitovant, which expired on March 31, 2021.\n\u2022costs to identify, acquire, develop, and commercialize additional product candidates;\nCost of Product Revenue\nInterest Expense\n\u2022On October 21, 2020, we presented one-year efficacy and safety data from the LIBERTY long-term extension study at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine ( ASRM\u201d) 2020 Virtual Congress.\nFor units of account under ASC 606, we apply significant judgment when evaluating whether contractual obligations represent distinct performance obligations, allocating transaction price to performance obligations within a contract, determining when performance obligations have been met, assessing the recognition and future reversal of variable consideration, and determining and applying appropriate methods of measuring progress for performance obligations satisfied over time. These judgements are discussed in more detail below:\nOn December 18, 2020, the FDA approved ORGOVYX for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. In January 2021, we began to generate product revenue from sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. We record product revenue net of estimated discounts, chargebacks, rebates, product returns, and other gross-to-net revenue deductions.\ncompensation expense (which includes approximately $25.7 million related to the acceleration, modification and remeasurement of our former Principal Executive Officer's equity awards). These items were partially offset by a net loss for the period of $255.1 million primarily due to our ongoing development and clinical studies, and activities related to our preparation for potential regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product candidates, and the expansion of our company, and a non-cash foreign currency transaction gain of $16.2 million primarily related to amounts outstanding under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Agreement.\nProduct Revenue, Net\nOur collaboration revenue represents the partial amortization of the upfront payment we received from Pfizer pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOur interest income consists primarily of interest earned and the accretion of discounts to maturity for cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nWe consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain and products manufactured prior to regulatory approval may not be sold unless regulatory approval is obtained. As such, the manufacturing costs for product candidates incurred prior to regulatory approval are not capitalized as inventory, but rather expensed as R&D expenses when incurred.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2021 and Recent Business Updates\nIn this section, we summarize certain of our expected upcoming clinical and regulatory milestones.\nPrevention of Pregnancy (SERENE Program)\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nIn connection with the FDA approval of ORGOVYX on December 18, 2020, we subsequently began capitalizing the cost of inventory manufactured or purchased after this date. Prior to December 18, 2020, costs to manufacture ORGOVYX were expensed as incurred as R&D expenses. As a result, minimal cost of goods sold has been recorded for quantities of ORGOVYX\n\u2022the timing, shared costs, and level of investment in our and our collaboration partners' activities related to sales, marketing, market access, manufacturing, and distribution for ORGOVYX and for any other product candidates that may receive marketing approval;\nLicense and milestone revenue for the year ended March 31, 2021 represents the partial recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with upfront and regulatory milestone payments we received from Richter pursuant to the terms of the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement. There were no such amounts recognized for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nR&D expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of program-specific costs composed of CRO, drug supply, regulatory, and manufacturing related costs of $133.4 million, personnel expenses of $32.7 million, share-based compensation expense of $14.5 million, and other R&D costs of $11.9 million, which primarily includes contractors, consultants, and information technology costs. The share-based compensation expense includes $1.8 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards as a result of a change in control of Myovant in connection with the closing of the Sumitomo-Roivant Transaction (see Note 6(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOur accruals for clinical studies and other R&D activities are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical study sites, CROs, and CMOs. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee, unit price, upon achievement of a milestone event, or on a time and materials basis. Payments under these agreements depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, the successful enrollment of patients, and the completion of portions of the clinical study or similar conditions. The objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our audited consolidated financial statements to the actual services received and efforts\nSG&A expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of share-based compensation expense of $25.7 million, personnel expenses of $19.1 million, commercial operations expenses of $12.7 million, general overhead, administrative and information technology expenses of $11.9 million, professional service fees of $6.0 million, a capital tax accrual of $3.6 million, and rent and other facilities-related costs of $2.8 million. The share-based compensation expense includes $10.2 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards as a result of a change in control of Myovant in connection with the closing of the Sumitomo-Roivant Transaction (see Note 6(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nfree trial drug and patient assistance for qualified uninsured patients. The timing of these increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on our commercial success and sales growth of ORGOVYX, as well as the timing of any new product launches and other potential business and operational activities.\nWe expect that certain SG&A expenses will be shared equally with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement.\n\u2022costs to integrate acquired technologies into a comprehensive regulatory and product development strategy;\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nInterest Expense\nOur cost of product revenue is composed of the cost of goods sold and royalty expense. Our cost of goods sold consists of raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs to manufacture the raw materials into finished product, freight, and indirect overhead costs associated with sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. Our royalty expense consists of a fixed, high single-digit royalty on net sales of ORGOVYX payable to Takeda pursuant to the terms of the Takeda License Agreement (see Note 14(D) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nassociated with uterine fibroids, which has been accepted by the FDA with a target action date of June 1, 2021. We launched ORGOVYX in the U.S. in early January 2021, and may launch other approved products in the COVID-19 environment. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals may reduce staffing and reduce or postpone appointments with patients, or patients may cancel or miss appointments, resulting in potential delays in diagnosis and treatment, and therefore fewer prescriptions. In addition, multiple medical conferences have been cancelled, postponed or moved to virtual formats, resulting in fewer opportunities to present our scientific data. In addition, our sales teams have been and would likely have to continue to make presentations to physicians and the medical community in many cases by virtual means instead of in-person, which could reduce the number of medical professionals we are able to present to, and these virtual meetings may not be as successful as in-person meetings. Reduced access to healthcare providers as a result of social distancing protocols may impact or require adjustments to our planned commercialization activities, including the manner in which our field teams engage with healthcare providers and facilities. At this time, we do not believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted us relative to other companies in our industry and the medical community appears to be highly engaged with our field team. To date, we have not experienced supply constraints, and we believe we have procured sufficient quantities of relugolix drug substance to meet our U.S. ORGOVYX launch plans and U.S. launch plans for relugolix combination tablet, if approved.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nCorporate\n\u2022MAA submission to the EMA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with endometriosis-associated pain expected in calendar year 2021. Richter will be the MAA sponsor.\n\u2022costs to hire additional commercial operations, sales, scientific, clinical, regulatory, quality, and other personnel to support our commercialization, regulatory, and clinical development efforts;\n\nOur R&D expenses to date have been primarily attributable to the clinical development of our product candidates including the conduct of multiple Phase 3 and earlier clinical studies, the expansion of our team, and the initiation of activities in preparation for our anticipated commercial launches such as the establishment of our medical affairs function, as well as regulatory and certain manufacturing activities. Our R&D expenses include program-specific costs, as well as costs that are not allocated to a specific program.\n\u2022On January 26, 2021, we and Pfizer announced positive one-year safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 SPIRIT long-term extension study.\nFinancing Activities\nIn addition, the probability of commercial success for ORGOVYX, or for any of our current or potential future product candidates, if approved, will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. As a result, we are unable to determine with certainty to what extent we will generate net product revenue from commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval. Our R&D activities may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our priorities and available resources.\nBusiness Overview\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLoss on extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the carrying amount of our previously outstanding debt with Hercules and NovaQuest and the amounts we paid to retire the outstanding debt obligations on December 31, 2019.\n\u2022On September 14, 2020, we announced one-year data on bone mineral density from the Phase 3 LIBERTY program and from a prospective observational study of women with uterine fibroids.\nRevenues\nOur accrual estimates are dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by third parties regarding the status and cost of studies, and may not match the actual services performed by these organizations. During the course of a clinical study, we adjust our rate of clinical study expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our clinical study expense as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known at that time. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. This could result in adjustment to our R&D expense in future periods.\nAdvanced Prostate Cancer (HERO Program)\nStrategic Partnerships\n\u2022On April 5, 2021, we announced the appointment of Lauren Merendino as Chief Commercial Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, $145.9 million of cash was provided by financing activities. This was primarily due to the net proceeds of $137.0 million we received from issuances of our common shares, which included $134.5 million from the issuance and sale of 17,424,243 common shares in our underwritten public equity offering and $2.5 million from the sale of 106,494 common shares through our at-the-market\u201d equity offering program, and proceeds of $113.7 million borrowed under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement. In addition, we received proceeds of $0.9 million from the exercise of stock options under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. These amounts were partially offset by the repayment of our financing obligations and redemption fees to NovaQuest and Hercules, including payments to NovaQuest of $60.0 million for repayment of principal, early redemption fee of $2.4 million, and an annual debt administration fee of $0.3 million, and payments to Hercules of $40.0 million for repayment of principal, a prepayment penalty of $0.4 million, and an end-of-term charge of $2.6 million.\n\u2022costs to service our debt obligations and associated interest payments; and\nCash Flows\nInterest Income\nInterest expense was $10.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2021 and was primarily related to the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, compared to $12.7 million in the year ended March 31, 2020 primarily related to our previously outstanding financing arrangements with NovaQuest and Hercules. The decrease in interest expense, despite higher outstanding loan balances, was primarily driven by the significantly lower interest rates associated with the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement as compared to the previously outstanding debt obligations to NovaQuest and Hercules, which were repaid in December 2019. Interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2021 also includes $0.6 million of accretion of the financing component of the cost share advance from Pfizer (see Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). There was no such accretion for the year ended March 31, 2020.\n\u2022On March 29, 2021, we announced that the European Medicines Agency ( EMA\u201d) validated our previously submitted Marketing Authorization Application ( MAA\u201d) for relugolix for the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer. The validation of the application confirmed that the submission is sufficiently complete for the EMA to begin the formal review process. If approved, relugolix would be the first and only oral androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer in Europe.\nWe believe that the estimates derived from the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. We define our critical accounting policies as those under U.S. GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and we believe that our estimates and judgments relating to\nOur foreign exchange gain consists of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign exchange denominated liabilities, relative to the U.S. dollar. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations fluctuates period over period based on our foreign currency exposures resulting from changes in applicable exchange rates associated with our foreign denominated liabilities. Our primary foreign currency exposure has historically been the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.\nIn addition, we are dependent on collaborative partners to provide us with information in a timely and accurate manner for use in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Certain of this information may also be subject to estimates. Should our collaborative partners fail to provide us with any such information in a timely manner, or should any estimates upon which such financial information was based, prove to be inaccurate, we could be required to record such adjustments in future periods.\nForeign Exchange Gain\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTo date, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to advance our clinical studies, our regulatory activities, our U.S. commercial launch activities for ORGOVYX, and our preparations for the potential commercialization of relugolix combination tablet has been limited and all of our publicly announced milestones remain on track. The FDA approved ORGOVYX for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer on December 18, 2020. In May 2020, we submitted our NDA to the FDA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with heavy menstrual bleeding\n\u2022On April 22, 2020 and June 23, 2020, we announced positive top-line results from the SPIRIT 2 and SPIRIT 1 studies, respectively.\n\u2022In May 2020, we submitted a New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) to the FDA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, which has been accepted by the FDA with a target action date of June 1, 2021. If approved, we and Pfizer expect to launch relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of uterine fibroids in the U.S. in June 2021.\n\u2022costs to operate as a public company.\nThe duration, costs and timing of clinical studies and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: the number of studies required for approval; the per patient study costs; the number of patients who participate in the studies; the number of sites included in the studies; the countries in which the studies are conducted; the length of time required to recruit and enroll eligible patients; the number of patients who fail to meet the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria; the number of study drug doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; the potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; the duration of patient follow-up; the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals; the costs of clinical study materials; and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.\nFor the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, our R&D expenses consisted of the following (in thousands):", "item_7_text": "While ASC 808 defines collaborative arrangements and provides guidance on the income statement presentation, classification, and disclosures related to such arrangements, it does not address recognition and measurement matters, such as (1) determining the appropriate unit of account or (2) when the recognition criteria are met. Therefore, the accounting for these arrangements is either based on an analogy to other accounting literature, such as ASC 606, or an accounting policy election by management. For units of account within the collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate revenue recognition method is determined and applied consistently.\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when physical control of our product is transferred to our customers, who are specialty distributors and pharmacies. Product sales are recorded net of various forms of variable consideration, including estimated (a) invoice discounts for prompt payment and specialty distributor and specialty pharmacy service fees, (b) government and private payer rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, (c) group purchasing organization (GPO) discounts, performance rebates and administrative fees, (d) product returns and (e) costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients (collectively, sales deductions\u201d).\nResearch and Development Expenses\nSince our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to identifying and in-licensing our product candidates, organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, preparing for and advancing the clinical development of our product candidates, preparing for and achieving regulatory approvals, and preparing for and executing on commercialization of our product candidates. Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our common shares, from debt financing arrangements, and more recently from the upfront and milestone payments we received from Pfizer Inc. ( Pfizer\u201d) and Gedeon Richter Plc. ( Richter\u201d). We launched our first product, ORGOVYX, in the U.S. in January 2021 and began generating product revenue, net from sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. in January 2021.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n\u2022Licenses of intellectual property: If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are not distinct from other promises, we apply judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the related revenue recognition accordingly.\nOur interest expense through December 31, 2019 consists of interest expense related to our previously outstanding debt with Hercules Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d) and NovaQuest Capital Management ( NovaQuest\u201d), which we repaid on December 31, 2019, as well as the associated non-cash amortization of related debt discounts and issuance costs. Subsequently, our interest expense consists of related party interest expense pursuant to the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, which bears interest at a rate per annum equal to 3-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3% payable on the last day of each calendar quarter. For the year ended March 31, 2021, our interest expense also includes accretion of the financing component of the cost share advance from Pfizer. See Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement.\n\u2022On October 20, 2020, data from the Phase 3 SPIRIT studies were presented at the ASRM 2020 Virtual Congress and the presentation was named the Prize Paper by the Endometriosis Special Interest Group.\nThere was no loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended March 31, 2021. For the year ended March 31, 2020, we incurred a $4.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts, prepayment penalties and early redemption fees in connection with the repayment of our outstanding obligations to NovaQuest and Hercules.\n\nWe have entered into agreements with certain vendors for the provision of goods and services, which includes manufacturing services with CMOs and development services with respect to CROs. These agreements may include certain provisions for purchase obligations and termination obligations that could require payment for the cancellation of committed purchase obligations or for early termination of the agreements. The amounts of the cancellation or termination payments vary and are based on the timing of the cancellation or termination and the specific terms of the agreements and are considered cancellable contracts. These cancellable contracts are not included in the table above.\n\u2022the price, level of demand and net revenues generated from commercial sales of ORGOVYX and from any other product candidates that may receive marketing approval;\nOur income tax expense was $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was (0.13)% and (0.26)%, respectively, and is driven by our jurisdictional earnings by location and a valuation allowance that eliminates our global net deferred tax assets.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\u2022Regulatory submission to the FDA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with endometriosis-associated pain expected in the second quarter of calendar year 2021.\nCollaboration Expense to Pfizer\nWe expect SG&A expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure and capabilities as well as general administrative functions to support multiple product launches and commercialization activities. These increases will likely include expenses associated with our oncology sales force which began promoting ORGOVYX in the U.S. in January 2021, as well as expected costs associated with the further build out of our commercial operations functions and the hiring of our women's health sales force in advance of the potential FDA approval of relugolix combination tablet. SG&A expenses in future periods are also expected to include certain expenses related to our patient support programs such as\n\u2022Royalties and commercial milestone payments: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including commercial milestone payments based on pre-specified level of sales, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Achievement of these royalties and commercial milestones may solely depend upon performance of the licensee.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, we issued and sold common shares under our sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen\u201d) to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million from time to time through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program under which Cowen was our agent. During the year ended March 31, 2020, we sold common shares under this agreement for aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $2.5 million after deducting underwriting commissions and offering costs paid by us. No common shares were sold under the sales agreement during the year ended March 31, 2021. The at-the-market\u201d equity offering program expired in March 2021.\nIn December 2020, we changed the functional currency of our wholly-owned subsidiary in Switzerland, MSG, from the Swiss franc to the U.S. dollar. This change in functional currency is accounted for prospectively. As a result of this change, we currently expect that future impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations will not be significant. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022European Commission decision on the uterine fibroids MAA expected in mid-calendar year 2021. If approved, this launch will be executed by Richter, our commercialization partner for relugolix combination tablet for the uterine fibroids and endometriosis indications in Europe and certain other international markets.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by the parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple units of account, we first determine which units of account of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n\u2022costs to implement or enhance operational, accounting, finance, quality, commercial, and management information systems;\nProduct revenue, net from sales of ORGOVYX was $3.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2021. There were no such amounts recognized for the year ended March 31, 2020. Product revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts, chargebacks, rebates, product returns, and other gross-to-net revenue deductions.\nexperience, product price increases or decreases, current contractual and statutory requirements, unbilled claims, processing time lags for claims, inventory levels in the distribution channel, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in net product revenue only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results vary from our estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\n\u2022Milestone payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes research, development or regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price on a cumulative catch-up basis in earnings in the period of the adjustment.\nThe variability in the net transaction price for our product arises primarily from the aforementioned sales deductions. Significant judgment is required in estimating certain sales deductions. In making these estimates, we consider our historical\nR&D expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 consisted primarily of program-specific costs composed of CRO, drug supply and other study, regulatory, and manufacturing related costs of $60.1 million, which includes fees related to our NDA submissions for ORGOVYX and relugolix combination tablet for uterine fibroids of $5.8 million, personnel expenses of $48.5 million, share-based compensation expense of $14.0 million, and other R&D costs of $14.1 million, which primarily includes contractors, consultants, and information technology costs and other unallocated nonclinical research costs. R&D expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 are presented net of approximately $13.9 million of cost share reimbursement from Pfizer.\n\u2022On April 12, 2021, we and Pfizer announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase 3 single-arm, open-label SERENE study evaluating the contraceptive efficacy of relugolix combination tablet in healthy women ages 18-35 years who are at risk for pregnancy.\n\u2022As of March 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $684.9 million. We currently believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022In December 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer under which we and Pfizer will jointly develop and commercialize relugolix in oncology and women's health and equally share profits and certain expenses, in the U.S. and Canada (the Co-Promotion Territory\u201d). In December 2020, we received a $650.0 million upfront payment and we are eligible to receive up to $3.7 billion of additional milestone payments, including two regulatory milestones of $100.0 million upon each FDA approval for relugolix combination tablet in uterine fibroids and endometriosis ($200.0 million in the aggregate), and tiered sales milestones of up to $3.5 billion upon reaching certain thresholds of annual net sales for oncology and the combined women's health indications in the Co-Promotion Territory. We granted Pfizer an exclusive option to acquire development and commercialization rights to relugolix in oncology outside of the Co-Promotion Territory (excluding certain Asian markets). If Pfizer exercises this option, we will receive an additional $50.0 million payment and will be eligible to receive double-digit royalties on net sales. Pfizer's decision is expected in mid-calendar year 2021.\nInterest income was approximately $0.2 million and $2.6 million for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in interest rates.\n\nR&D expenses decreased by $55.8 million, to $136.7 million, in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to $192.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease reflects a reduction in clinical study costs as a result of the wind down of our Phase 3 LIBERTY, HERO, and SPIRIT studies and cost reimbursements from Pfizer for certain R&D expenses (See Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). This decrease was partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses mainly driven by the continued expansion of our medical affairs organization in preparation for the U.S. commercial launch of ORGOVYX and the potential U.S. commercial launches of relugolix combination tablet, if approved, as well as regulatory expenses and submission fees.\nR&D expenses primarily include personnel-related costs for employees engaged in R&D activities and costs of third-parties who conduct clinical study and clinical manufacturing activities on our behalf, and are expensed as incurred unless there is an alternative future use in other R&D projects. Payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product and payments for milestones achieved prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred as R&D.\n\u2022costs to maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\nPursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $3.7 billion of additional milestone payments, including two regulatory milestones of $100.0 million upon each FDA approval for relugolix combination tablet in uterine fibroids and endometriosis ($200.0 million in the aggregate), and tiered sales milestones of up to $3.5 billion upon reaching certain thresholds of annual net sales for oncology and the combined women's health indications in the Co-Promotion Territory. We and Pfizer will equally share profits and certain expenses in the Co-Promotion Territory. In addition, if Pfizer exercises its option to acquire exclusive commercialization and development rights to relugolix in oncology in the Pfizer Territory, we will receive an option exercise fee of $50.0 million and will also be eligible to receive double-digit royalties on net sales of relugolix in the Pfizer Territory.\n\u2022costs to expand our chemistry, manufacturing, and control and other manufacturing related activities;\n\u2022costs, timing, and outcomes of regulatory submissions and regulatory reviews of our product candidates;\nFor information regarding the impact of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere is also judgement involved in the identification of costs that we incur related to the collaboration activities, evaluating the nature of these costs (for example, whether the costs relate to a particular geography or territory or whether the costs relate to clinical or commercial activities), and applying the terms of the respective collaborative arrangement to determine the portion of such costs that are the responsibility of the collaboration partner, which in certain circumstances requires significant judgement.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, our collaboration expense to Pfizer was $1.7 million and represents Pfizer's 50% share of net profits from the sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\u2022ORGOVYX became commercially available through authorized specialty distributors in the U.S. in early January 2021. Our oncology sales force began promoting ORGOVYX to target prescribers in early January 2021 and the uro-oncology sales force of our collaboration partner, Pfizer, began actively promoting ORGOVYX to target prescribers in early February 2021.\nIn this section, we summarize certain of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and recent clinical, regulatory, and corporate updates. Additional information about our business, our approved product, and our product candidates is included in Part I. Item 1., Business,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nexpended. As such, expense accruals related to clinical studies and other R&D activities are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the agreements.\nCapital Requirements\nInterest Income\n\u2022the timing, shared costs, and level of investment in our and our collaboration partners' research and development activities involving ORGOVYX, relugolix monotherapy tablet, relugolix combination tablet, and any other product candidates;\nInvesting Activities\nFor collaboration arrangements that are within the scope of ASC 808, the recognition of collaboration revenue (expense) requires management judgement due to the fact that the terms of collaboration arrangements may be complicated, and the nature of the collaborative activities may change over time. Management judgement is exercised in determining the units of account within a collaboration arrangement and in allocating consideration to those units, estimating the collaboration revenue to be recognized, including estimating an appropriate term over which the collaboration revenue is expected to be recognized, as well as in determining the amortization method. For example, judgement is required in identifying material rights and performance obligations, and in estimating the stand-alone selling price of identified performance obligations and material rights, the estimates of which may include forecasted revenue, development timelines, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\n\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our common shares, from debt financing arrangements, and more recently from upfront and milestone payments we received from Richter and Pfizer. We began generating product revenue, net from the sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. in January 2021.\n\u2022In August 2020, we entered into a three-year commercial collaboration agreement with Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Sunovion\u201d). Under the agreement, Sunovion will provide certain third-party logistics, trade and retail distribution, contract operations, and market access account management services, and other services to us and, Sunovion will become a non-exclusive distributor of relugolix for prostate cancer and the exclusive distributor of relugolix combination tablet for uterine fibroids and endometriosis in the U.S.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, we used $221.2 million of cash in operating activities primarily due to our ongoing clinical studies, activities related to our preparation for potential regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product candidates, and the expansion of our company. This was primarily attributable to a net loss for the period of $289.0 million and a decrease of $24.7 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulting primarily from a decrease in accrued R&D expenses and decreases of $1.1 million in interest payable and $2.3 million in deferred interest payable related to our previously outstanding debt which was repaid in full on December 31, 2019. These amounts were partially offset by an increase of $40.0 million in deferred revenue related to the upfront payment we received from Richter on March 31, 2020, an increase in accounts payable of $4.3 million, due to timing of invoice payments, and an increase in other liabilities of $3.6 million, due to a capital tax accrual as a result of the change in control in Myovant, along with non-cash items including $40.3 million of share-based compensation expense as a result of an increase in headcount (which also includes $12.0 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards as a result of the change in control in Myovant in connection with the closing of the transaction between Roivant and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma), $3.3 million of total depreciation, amortization and non-cash interest expense, and a $4.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts, prepayment penalties and early redemption fees in connection with the repayment of outstanding obligations to NovaQuest and Hercules on December 31, 2019.\n\u2022FDA decision for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of uterine fibroids expected by the June 1, 2021 target action date. If approved, we and Pfizer expect to launch relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of uterine fibroids in the U.S. in June 2021. Upon approval, we will receive a $100.0 million regulatory milestone payment from Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement.\nCost of Product Revenue\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section generally discusses the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 items and comparisons between these fiscal years. Discussions of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 items and comparisons between the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Item 7 of Part II, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on May 18, 2020.\nOur program-specific costs primarily include third-party costs, which include expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and CMOs, the cost of consultants who assist with the development of our product candidates on a program-specific basis, investigator grants, sponsored research, manufacturing costs in connection with producing materials for use in conducting nonclinical and clinical studies, as well as costs related to pre-commercial manufacturing activities and regulatory submissions, and other third-party expenses directly attributable to the development of our product candidates.\nSG&A expenses increased by $99.1 million, to $181.4 million, in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to $82.3 million in the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to higher expenses related to commercial activities to support the ORGOVYX U.S. commercial launch and the potential U.S. commercial launches of relugolix combination tablet as well as higher personnel-related expenses primarily due to the hiring of our commercial operations, marketing, and market access teams, and our oncology sales force, higher share-based compensation expense primarily as a result of the acceleration, modification, and remeasurement of our former Principal Executive Officer's equity awards (see Note 10(H) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and general overhead expenses to support our organizational growth.\n\u2022the achievement of regulatory milestones, sales milestones, and royalties that we are eligible to earn pursuant to the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement and the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement;\nfranchise, and potentially further develop our other product candidates and expand our pipeline. We expect our net cash burn to gradually decrease as our net revenues increase but our future capital requirements and operating expenses are expected to continue to be significant. Our operating expenses and operating cash flows may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nSources of Liquidity\nOur collaboration expense to Pfizer consists of Pfizer's 50% share of net profits from sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\n\u2022On December 18, 2020, the FDA approved ORGOVYX for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. ORGOVYX, which was granted Priority Review by the FDA, is the first and only oral GnRH receptor antagonist for men with advanced prostate cancer.\nLicense, Milestone, and Other Revenue\nAs of March 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement of $726.2 million, consisting of $684.9 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $41.3 million of borrowing capacity available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, as compared to cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement of $365.9 million, consisting of $79.6 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $286.3 million of borrowing capacity available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, as of March 31, 2020. Additional funds under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement may be drawn down by us no more than once per calendar quarter, subject to certain terms and conditions, including consent of our board of directors.\nResearch and Development Expenses and Accruals\nPursuant to the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $137.5 million of additional milestone payments, including regulatory milestones of up to $30.0 million and tiered sales milestones of up to $107.5 million upon reaching certain thresholds of annual net sales for relugolix combination tablet in Richter's territory, and tiered royalties on net sales following regulatory approval for relugolix combination tablet in Richter's territory.\nUterine Fibroids (LIBERTY Program)\n\u2022In May 2020, efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 HERO study were simultaneously published online in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO\u201d)'s ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program.\ncollaboration arrangements, revenue recognition, and R&D expenses and accruals have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, refer to Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies.\nContractual Obligations\nEndometriosis (SPIRIT Program)\nProduct and Product Candidates\nOur revenues to date have been generated substantially from the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement and the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, which are further discussed in Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We began commercializing ORGOVYX in the U.S. for adult patients with advanced prostate cancer in January 2021.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, $370.6 million of cash was provided by operating activities, which was primarily driven by a net increase in deferred revenue of $457.9 million and a net increase in cost share advance from collaboration partner of $121.2 million, both of which were largely driven by the upfront payment received from Pfizer in December 2020 discussed previously. For the year ended March 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities also included an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $15.6 million (primarily due to an increase in accrued commercial and compensation-related expenses partially offset by a decrease in accrued R&D expenses), as well as $53.7 million of non-cash share-based\nIn connection with the Takeda License Agreement, we are required to pay Takeda a fixed, high single-digit royalty on net sales of relugolix and MVT-602 products in our territory. We cannot, at this time, determine when or if royalty payments will be required or what the total amount of such payments may be. Therefore, such payments are not included in the table above. See Note 14(D) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nR&D activities have been, and will continue to be, central to our business model. We currently expect R&D expenses for the year ending March 31, 2022, to be modestly lower than the R&D expenses incurred in the year ended March 31, 2021, largely due to our sharing of certain expenses with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Overall, we expect declining spend on our Phase 3 clinical programs that are winding down to be offset primarily by incremental spend on new relugolix development programs, such as the Phase 3 SERENE study, to potentially expand the commercial opportunity for the relugolix franchise.\nIn connection with the FDA approval of ORGOVYX on December 18, 2020, we subsequently began capitalizing inventory manufactured or purchased after this date. As a result, we expensed certain manufacturing costs of ORGOVYX as R&D expenses prior to FDA approval and, therefore, these costs are not included in cost of goods sold.\nOur unallocated R&D costs primarily include employee-related expenses, such as salaries, share-based compensation, fringe benefits and travel for employees engaged in R&D activities including clinical operations, biostatistics, regulatory, and medical affairs, and the cost of contractors and consultants who assist with R&D activities not specific to a program and costs associated with nonclinical studies.\nContract Service Providers\nWe expect that certain R&D expenses will be shared equally with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, we used $9.2 million of cash in investing activities, of which $7.4 million was for the purchase of marketable securities, net of maturities and sales, and $1.8 million was for the purchase of property and equipment.\nsold during for the year ended March 31, 2021 as these costs were previously recorded as R&D expenses. We expect our cost of goods sold to increase in future periods as quantities of zero-cost ORGOVYX inventory are depleted from our inventory stock.\n\u2022On March 24, 2021, we and Pfizer announced positive safety and efficacy data from the LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study.\nThe following table provides information with respect to our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2021 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future years (in thousands):\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic resulting from the disease known as COVID-19 caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-Co V-2. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed essential,\u201d isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing when engaging in essential activities. In certain countries, and in certain states within the U.S., such orders have been lifted, although recent trends in COVID-19 infections have led to the reinstatement of such orders in various jurisdictions. It remains unclear how long these measures will remain in place and whether these measures will be effective. Further, recently it has been reported that the rate of the reported number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is increasing, and new more virulent variants of the coronavirus have been identified, which may further impact the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on us.\n(2) Operating lease obligations consist of future rent payments under lease and sublease agreements for office space located in Brisbane, California. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCollaboration Arrangements\nSG&A expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 consisted primarily of personnel expenses of $56.4 million, commercial operations expenses of $43.8 million, general overhead, administrative and information technology expenses of $24.6 million, shared-based compensation expense of $39.6 million (which includes approximately $25.7 million related to the acceleration, modification and remeasurement of our former Principal Executive Officer's equity awards as discussed further in Note 10(H) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), professional service fees of $9.0 million, and rent and other facilities-related costs of $3.5 million. For the year ended March 31, 2021, we also incurred related party expenses of $5.3 million pursuant to our agreements with Sunovion and Sumitovant. For additional information about these related party expenses, see Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. SG&A expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 are presented net of approximately $10.9 million of cost share reimbursement from Pfizer.\nResults of Operations\nLicense Agreement with Takeda\nOur license and milestone revenue represents the partial recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with upfront and regulatory milestone payments we received from Richter pursuant to the terms of the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement (see Note 13(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We recognize revenue as we satisfy our combined performance obligation to Richter.\nIn an effort to protect the safety of our employees and our patients, we adopted safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that meet or exceed the guidelines established by government and public health officials. These measures include adopting policies applicable to office-based employees such as working from home, limiting the number of employees on site, and limiting business travel. At this time, we have not identified a material change to our productivity as a result of these measures, but this could change, particularly if restricted travel, closed schools, and shelter-in-place orders are not removed or significantly eased.\nExpected Upcoming Clinical and Regulatory Milestones\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended March 31, 2021 represents the partial amortization of the upfront payment received from Pfizer pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement. There were no such amounts recognized for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nOur majority shareholder is Sumitovant Biopharma Ltd. ( Sumitovant\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. ( Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma\u201d). As of March 31, 2021, Sumitovant directly, and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma indirectly, own 48,641,181, or approximately 53.5%, of our outstanding common shares.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on redefining care for women and for men through purpose-driven science, empowering medicines, and transformative advocacy. ORGOVYXTM (relugolix) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) in 2020 as the first and only oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH\u201d) receptor antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix is also under regulatory review in Europe for men with advanced prostate cancer. In addition, relugolix combination tablet (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) is under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe for women with uterine fibroids, has completed Phase 3 registration-enabling studies for women with endometriosis, and is being assessed for contraceptive efficacy in healthy women ages 18-35 years who are at risk for pregnancy. We are also developing MVT-602, an oligopeptide kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist, which has completed a Phase 2a study for the treatment of female infertility as a part of assisted reproduction.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, our cost of product revenue was $0.3 million, which includes the cost of goods sold and royalty expense payable to Takeda pursuant to the Takeda License Agreement (see Note 14(D) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, we used $3.9 million of cash in investing activities, of which $2.8 million was for the purchase of marketable securities, net of maturities, and $1.1 million was for the purchase of property and equipment.\n\u2022On January 4, 2021, we announced the appointment of David Marek as Chief Executive Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc. Concurrent with this appointment, Mr. Marek was also appointed as Principal Executive Officer of Myovant Sciences Ltd. and as a member of our board of directors. Mr. Marek succeeds Dr. Lynn Seely, who previously held these positions.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial net product revenue from sales of ORGOVYX, relugolix combination tablet, MVT-602, or any future product candidate, we expect to fund our operations through a combination of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities currently on hand and amounts available to us under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, subject to the consent of our board of directors, as well as potential payments we are eligible to receive from Pfizer and Richter pursuant to the terms of our agreements with them.\nFor the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net losses of $255.1 million and $289.0 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.0 billion. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately $684.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We currently believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This estimate is based on our current assumptions, including assumptions related to our ability to manage our spend, that might prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In future periods, if our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts that we expect to generate from product sales and/or third-party collaboration payments, are not sufficient to enable us to fund our operations, we may need to raise additional funds in the form of equity, debt, or from other sources. In addition, we may choose to raise additional funds in the form of equity, debt, or from other sources due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current and future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our common shareholders' ownership interest may experience substantial dilution, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our common shareholders' rights. The Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement involves, and any agreements for future debt or preferred equity financings, if available, may involve, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, raising capital through equity offerings, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\n\u2022In February 2021, we and our collaboration partner, Pfizer, announced publication in the New England Journal of Medicine of the Phase 3 LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies of investigational once-daily relugolix combination therapy in women with uterine fibroids.\n(1) Related party debt obligations, including interest charge consists of principal and future interest payments due to Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma pursuant to the terms of the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement based on the amounts outstanding at March 31, 2021 and the interest rate in effect at March 31, 2021. See Note 6(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nForeign exchange gain consists of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign exchange denominated liabilities. The impact of foreign exchange rates on our results of operations fluctuated period over period based on our foreign currency exposures resulting from changes in applicable exchange rates associated with our foreign denominated liabilities. For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a foreign exchange gain of $16.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The $14.6 million increase in foreign exchange gains in the year ended March 31, 2021 was primarily the result of the increase in our outstanding balance under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement and the impact of fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nWe have taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions, in our approach to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state, and local public health authorities and may take additional action based on their recommendations. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our financial results, our clinical studies, our supply chains, our commercial launch for ORGOVYX, and pre-launch commercial readiness activities for relugolix combination tablet, end user demand for our products, if approved, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot estimate the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Refer to the risk factor titled Business interruptions resulting from effects of pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition,\u201d as well as other risk factors included in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d set forth in Part I. Item 1A.\nAmounts we receive prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue on the audited consolidated balance sheets. If the related efforts underlying the deferred revenue are expected to be satisfied within the next twelve months, the deferred revenue is classified in current liabilities, otherwise it is classified as a non-current liability.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe expect our operating expenses, net of costs that are expected to be shared with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, to increase as we commercialize ORGOVYX in the U.S., prepare for the potential regulatory approvals and commercialization of relugolix combination tablet, initiate life cycle management activities for our relugolix\n\u2022European Commission decision on the advanced prostate cancer MAA expected in calendar year 2022.\nCollaboration Expense to Pfizer\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, $238.0 million of cash was provided by financing activities. This was primarily due to proceeds of $245.0 million borrowed under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement and proceeds of $6.7 million from the exercise of stock options under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, partially offset by payment of tax withholdings on net settlement of share awards of $13.7 million.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOperating Activities\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these audited consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingencies as of the dates of the audited consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, or experience. Changes in estimates and assumptions are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.\nRevenues\nForeign Exchange Gain\nOur SG&A expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, sales incentive compensation, bonuses, fringe benefits, and share-based compensation expenses for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, commercial operations, marketing, market access, sales, and other administrative functions. Our SG&A expenses also include marketing programs, advertising, conferences, congresses, travel expenses, professional fees for legal, accounting, auditing and tax services, and costs related to rent and facilities, insurance, information technology, commercial operations, and general overhead. Our SG&A expenses also include costs incurred under our Market Access Services Agreement with Sunovion and our former consulting agreement with Sumitovant, which expired on March 31, 2021.\n\u2022costs to identify, acquire, develop, and commercialize additional product candidates;\nCost of Product Revenue\nInterest Expense\n\u2022On October 21, 2020, we presented one-year efficacy and safety data from the LIBERTY long-term extension study at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine ( ASRM\u201d) 2020 Virtual Congress.\nFor units of account under ASC 606, we apply significant judgment when evaluating whether contractual obligations represent distinct performance obligations, allocating transaction price to performance obligations within a contract, determining when performance obligations have been met, assessing the recognition and future reversal of variable consideration, and determining and applying appropriate methods of measuring progress for performance obligations satisfied over time. These judgements are discussed in more detail below:\nOn December 18, 2020, the FDA approved ORGOVYX for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. In January 2021, we began to generate product revenue from sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. We record product revenue net of estimated discounts, chargebacks, rebates, product returns, and other gross-to-net revenue deductions.\ncompensation expense (which includes approximately $25.7 million related to the acceleration, modification and remeasurement of our former Principal Executive Officer's equity awards). These items were partially offset by a net loss for the period of $255.1 million primarily due to our ongoing development and clinical studies, and activities related to our preparation for potential regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product candidates, and the expansion of our company, and a non-cash foreign currency transaction gain of $16.2 million primarily related to amounts outstanding under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Agreement.\nProduct Revenue, Net\nOur collaboration revenue represents the partial amortization of the upfront payment we received from Pfizer pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement (see Note 13(B) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOur interest income consists primarily of interest earned and the accretion of discounts to maturity for cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nWe consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain and products manufactured prior to regulatory approval may not be sold unless regulatory approval is obtained. As such, the manufacturing costs for product candidates incurred prior to regulatory approval are not capitalized as inventory, but rather expensed as R&D expenses when incurred.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2021 and Recent Business Updates\nIn this section, we summarize certain of our expected upcoming clinical and regulatory milestones.\nPrevention of Pregnancy (SERENE Program)\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nIn connection with the FDA approval of ORGOVYX on December 18, 2020, we subsequently began capitalizing the cost of inventory manufactured or purchased after this date. Prior to December 18, 2020, costs to manufacture ORGOVYX were expensed as incurred as R&D expenses. As a result, minimal cost of goods sold has been recorded for quantities of ORGOVYX\n\u2022the timing, shared costs, and level of investment in our and our collaboration partners' activities related to sales, marketing, market access, manufacturing, and distribution for ORGOVYX and for any other product candidates that may receive marketing approval;\nLicense and milestone revenue for the year ended March 31, 2021 represents the partial recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with upfront and regulatory milestone payments we received from Richter pursuant to the terms of the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement. There were no such amounts recognized for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nR&D expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of program-specific costs composed of CRO, drug supply, regulatory, and manufacturing related costs of $133.4 million, personnel expenses of $32.7 million, share-based compensation expense of $14.5 million, and other R&D costs of $11.9 million, which primarily includes contractors, consultants, and information technology costs. The share-based compensation expense includes $1.8 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards as a result of a change in control of Myovant in connection with the closing of the Sumitomo-Roivant Transaction (see Note 6(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOur accruals for clinical studies and other R&D activities are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical study sites, CROs, and CMOs. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee, unit price, upon achievement of a milestone event, or on a time and materials basis. Payments under these agreements depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, the successful enrollment of patients, and the completion of portions of the clinical study or similar conditions. The objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our audited consolidated financial statements to the actual services received and efforts\nSG&A expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of share-based compensation expense of $25.7 million, personnel expenses of $19.1 million, commercial operations expenses of $12.7 million, general overhead, administrative and information technology expenses of $11.9 million, professional service fees of $6.0 million, a capital tax accrual of $3.6 million, and rent and other facilities-related costs of $2.8 million. The share-based compensation expense includes $10.2 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards as a result of a change in control of Myovant in connection with the closing of the Sumitomo-Roivant Transaction (see Note 6(A) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nfree trial drug and patient assistance for qualified uninsured patients. The timing of these increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on our commercial success and sales growth of ORGOVYX, as well as the timing of any new product launches and other potential business and operational activities.\nWe expect that certain SG&A expenses will be shared equally with Pfizer pursuant to the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement.\n\u2022costs to integrate acquired technologies into a comprehensive regulatory and product development strategy;\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nInterest Expense\nOur cost of product revenue is composed of the cost of goods sold and royalty expense. Our cost of goods sold consists of raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs to manufacture the raw materials into finished product, freight, and indirect overhead costs associated with sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. Our royalty expense consists of a fixed, high single-digit royalty on net sales of ORGOVYX payable to Takeda pursuant to the terms of the Takeda License Agreement (see Note 14(D) to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nassociated with uterine fibroids, which has been accepted by the FDA with a target action date of June 1, 2021. We launched ORGOVYX in the U.S. in early January 2021, and may launch other approved products in the COVID-19 environment. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals may reduce staffing and reduce or postpone appointments with patients, or patients may cancel or miss appointments, resulting in potential delays in diagnosis and treatment, and therefore fewer prescriptions. In addition, multiple medical conferences have been cancelled, postponed or moved to virtual formats, resulting in fewer opportunities to present our scientific data. In addition, our sales teams have been and would likely have to continue to make presentations to physicians and the medical community in many cases by virtual means instead of in-person, which could reduce the number of medical professionals we are able to present to, and these virtual meetings may not be as successful as in-person meetings. Reduced access to healthcare providers as a result of social distancing protocols may impact or require adjustments to our planned commercialization activities, including the manner in which our field teams engage with healthcare providers and facilities. At this time, we do not believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted us relative to other companies in our industry and the medical community appears to be highly engaged with our field team. To date, we have not experienced supply constraints, and we believe we have procured sufficient quantities of relugolix drug substance to meet our U.S. ORGOVYX launch plans and U.S. launch plans for relugolix combination tablet, if approved.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nCorporate\n\u2022MAA submission to the EMA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with endometriosis-associated pain expected in calendar year 2021. Richter will be the MAA sponsor.\n\u2022costs to hire additional commercial operations, sales, scientific, clinical, regulatory, quality, and other personnel to support our commercialization, regulatory, and clinical development efforts;\n\nOur R&D expenses to date have been primarily attributable to the clinical development of our product candidates including the conduct of multiple Phase 3 and earlier clinical studies, the expansion of our team, and the initiation of activities in preparation for our anticipated commercial launches such as the establishment of our medical affairs function, as well as regulatory and certain manufacturing activities. Our R&D expenses include program-specific costs, as well as costs that are not allocated to a specific program.\n\u2022On January 26, 2021, we and Pfizer announced positive one-year safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 SPIRIT long-term extension study.\nFinancing Activities\nIn addition, the probability of commercial success for ORGOVYX, or for any of our current or potential future product candidates, if approved, will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. As a result, we are unable to determine with certainty to what extent we will generate net product revenue from commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval. Our R&D activities may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our priorities and available resources.\nBusiness Overview\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLoss on extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the carrying amount of our previously outstanding debt with Hercules and NovaQuest and the amounts we paid to retire the outstanding debt obligations on December 31, 2019.\n\u2022On September 14, 2020, we announced one-year data on bone mineral density from the Phase 3 LIBERTY program and from a prospective observational study of women with uterine fibroids.\nRevenues\nOur accrual estimates are dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by third parties regarding the status and cost of studies, and may not match the actual services performed by these organizations. During the course of a clinical study, we adjust our rate of clinical study expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our clinical study expense as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known at that time. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. This could result in adjustment to our R&D expense in future periods.\nAdvanced Prostate Cancer (HERO Program)\nStrategic Partnerships\n\u2022On April 5, 2021, we announced the appointment of Lauren Merendino as Chief Commercial Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, $145.9 million of cash was provided by financing activities. This was primarily due to the net proceeds of $137.0 million we received from issuances of our common shares, which included $134.5 million from the issuance and sale of 17,424,243 common shares in our underwritten public equity offering and $2.5 million from the sale of 106,494 common shares through our at-the-market\u201d equity offering program, and proceeds of $113.7 million borrowed under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement. In addition, we received proceeds of $0.9 million from the exercise of stock options under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. These amounts were partially offset by the repayment of our financing obligations and redemption fees to NovaQuest and Hercules, including payments to NovaQuest of $60.0 million for repayment of principal, early redemption fee of $2.4 million, and an annual debt administration fee of $0.3 million, and payments to Hercules of $40.0 million for repayment of principal, a prepayment penalty of $0.4 million, and an end-of-term charge of $2.6 million.\n\u2022costs to service our debt obligations and associated interest payments; and\nCash Flows\nInterest Income\nInterest expense was $10.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2021 and was primarily related to the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, compared to $12.7 million in the year ended March 31, 2020 primarily related to our previously outstanding financing arrangements with NovaQuest and Hercules. The decrease in interest expense, despite higher outstanding loan balances, was primarily driven by the significantly lower interest rates associated with the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement as compared to the previously outstanding debt obligations to NovaQuest and Hercules, which were repaid in December 2019. Interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2021 also includes $0.6 million of accretion of the financing component of the cost share advance from Pfizer (see Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). There was no such accretion for the year ended March 31, 2020.\n\u2022On March 29, 2021, we announced that the European Medicines Agency ( EMA\u201d) validated our previously submitted Marketing Authorization Application ( MAA\u201d) for relugolix for the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer. The validation of the application confirmed that the submission is sufficiently complete for the EMA to begin the formal review process. If approved, relugolix would be the first and only oral androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer in Europe.\nWe believe that the estimates derived from the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. We define our critical accounting policies as those under U.S. GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and we believe that our estimates and judgments relating to\nOur foreign exchange gain consists of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign exchange denominated liabilities, relative to the U.S. dollar. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations fluctuates period over period based on our foreign currency exposures resulting from changes in applicable exchange rates associated with our foreign denominated liabilities. Our primary foreign currency exposure has historically been the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.\nIn addition, we are dependent on collaborative partners to provide us with information in a timely and accurate manner for use in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Certain of this information may also be subject to estimates. Should our collaborative partners fail to provide us with any such information in a timely manner, or should any estimates upon which such financial information was based, prove to be inaccurate, we could be required to record such adjustments in future periods.\nForeign Exchange Gain\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTo date, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to advance our clinical studies, our regulatory activities, our U.S. commercial launch activities for ORGOVYX, and our preparations for the potential commercialization of relugolix combination tablet has been limited and all of our publicly announced milestones remain on track. The FDA approved ORGOVYX for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer on December 18, 2020. In May 2020, we submitted our NDA to the FDA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with heavy menstrual bleeding\n\u2022On April 22, 2020 and June 23, 2020, we announced positive top-line results from the SPIRIT 2 and SPIRIT 1 studies, respectively.\n\u2022In May 2020, we submitted a New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) to the FDA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, which has been accepted by the FDA with a target action date of June 1, 2021. If approved, we and Pfizer expect to launch relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of uterine fibroids in the U.S. in June 2021.\n\u2022costs to operate as a public company.\nThe duration, costs and timing of clinical studies and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: the number of studies required for approval; the per patient study costs; the number of patients who participate in the studies; the number of sites included in the studies; the countries in which the studies are conducted; the length of time required to recruit and enroll eligible patients; the number of patients who fail to meet the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria; the number of study drug doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; the potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; the duration of patient follow-up; the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals; the costs of clinical study materials; and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.\nFor the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, our R&D expenses consisted

is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for women's health and prostate cancer. Its lead product is Orgovyx (relugolix), which was approved by the FDA in 2020 as the first oral GnRH receptor antagonist for advanced prostate cancer. \n\n- In 2021, Myovant began generating product revenue from sales of Orgovyx in the U.S. Total revenues in 2021 were $59.3 million, up from $0 in 2020. This included $3.6 million in Orgovyx product revenue.\n\n- R&D expenses decreased from $192.6 million in 2020 to $136.7 million in 2021, primarily due to winding down of Phase 3 clinical trials. \n\n- SG&A expenses increased from $82.3 million in 2020 to $181.4 million in 2021, largely due to commercialization activities for Orgovyx launch and pre-launch activities for relugolix combination tablet.\n\n- Net loss in 2021 was $255.1 million compared to $289.0 million in 2020. Loss decrease was primarily driven by revenues generated in 2021.\n\n- As of March 2021, Myovant had $684.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. It expects continued operating losses as it commercializes Orgovyx and advances development of relugolix combination tablet.\n\nIn summary, Myovant is transitioning from an R&D focused company to a commercial-stage biopharma, as evidenced by the Orgovyx launch and increasing revenues. But it continues to operate at a net loss due to high costs of commercialization and drug development."}
