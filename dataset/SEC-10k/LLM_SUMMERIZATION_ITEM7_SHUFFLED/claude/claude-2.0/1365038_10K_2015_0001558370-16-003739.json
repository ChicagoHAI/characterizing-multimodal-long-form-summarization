Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item I, Part 1A, Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a diversified Internet company that builds platforms across its media and marketplaces properties to enable communities of creators to reach passionate audiences in large and growing lifestyle categories. Our business is comprised of two service offerings: Content & Media and Marketplaces.\nContent & Media\nOur Content & Media service offering includes our leading owned and operated online properties that publish media content, including text articles, videos, photographs and designed visual formats. This content is published across several key categories on eHow, a do-it-yourself and how-to reference destination; Livestrong.com, a health and healthy living destination; Cracked, a humor site offering original and engaging comedy-driven video series, text articles and blogs; and certain other niche properties focused on specific interests. Additionally, our studioD business develops and executes content marketing strategies and creates custom content for third-party brands, advertisers and publishers.\nOur Content & Media service offering derives the majority of its revenue from the sale of advertising on our online properties. Our advertising revenue is principally dependent on the number of visits to our properties and the corresponding ad unit rates. Since 2011, the total number of visits to our properties, particularly eHow, has substantially declined due to lower search engine referrals resulting from ongoing changes to search engine algorithms by Google, Yahoo! and Bing, as well as our decision to remove low quality and duplicative content. We have also experienced lower ad monetization due to industry declines in cost-per-click ad rates and our decision to reduce the number of ads per page on certain articles. In addition, visits across our online properties continue to shift from desktop to mobile, with ad unit rates for mobile generally lower than desktop. Future changes to search engine algorithms that negatively impact the volume of referral traffic, declines in ad unit rates, or increased availability of ad blocking software, particularly on mobile devices, could result in a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations.\nWe believe that there are opportunities to increase the number of visits to our online properties, both from direct visits by users and search engine referrals, by building high-quality products that provide a better user experience and lead to increased engagement. Since 2013, we have focused our efforts on redesigning our websites; refining our content library; rationalizing ad unit density; and developing a greater variety of content formats, particularly formats better suited for mobile devices. We have also recently started a new initiative to work with a network of contributors and influencers to create more authoritative and engaging content. These changes could negatively impact revenue and increase our operating expenses in the near term, but we believe that by providing consumers with an improved user and content experience, we will be able to increase the number of visits and revenue in a sustained fashion over the long-term. We also believe there are opportunities to increase our advertising revenue by optimizing our ad product stack and increasing branded ad sales through direct sellers and by offering more innovative products such as native advertisements and sponsored ad placements. However, if the overall ad unit rates we receive continue to decline, we could experience lower advertising revenue even if the number of visits to our properties increases.\nHistorically, the majority of our advertising revenue has been generated by our relationship with Google. While Google continues to be our primary ad vendor for ad monetization, in 2015 we began to significantly diversify our monetization partners and will continue to do so going forward. Google also serves as one of our primary technology\nplatform partners in connection with our programmatic ad sales offering. Any change in the type of services that Google provides to us, or to the terms of our agreements with Google, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nMarketplaces\nThrough our Marketplaces service offering, we operate two leading art and design marketplaces where large communities of artists can market and sell their original artwork or their original designs printed on a wide variety of products. Society6 provides artists with an online commerce platform to feature and sell their original designs on a wide variety of consumer and home d\u00e9cor products such as art prints, phone and tablet cases, t-shirts and throw pillows. Saatchi Art is an online art gallery featuring a wide selection of original paintings, drawings, sculptures and photography that provides a global community of artists a curated environment in which to exhibit and sell their work directly to customers around the world.\nOur Marketplaces service offering generates revenue from the sale of products and services through our art and design marketplaces. On Society6, revenue is generated from the sale of print-on-demand products. Saatchi Art primarily generates revenue through commissions on the final sale price of original works of art. Our Marketplaces service offering is principally dependent on the number of transactions and average revenue per transaction generated by products and services sold through our online marketplaces. We believe there are opportunities to increase the number of transactions and the average revenue per transaction by attracting new visitors to our marketplaces via diverse online and offline marketing, improving conversion of visitors to purchasing customers, continuing to introduce new products, and offering product bundling and other promotions.\nThe revenue generated by our Marketplaces service offering has higher costs associated with it as compared to our Content & Media service offering due to variable product costs, including outsourced product manufacturing costs, artist royalties, marketing costs, and shipping and handling costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, a higher percentage of our total revenue was generated by our Marketplaces service offering as compared to the prior year. If our revenue sources continue to shift from our Content & Media service offering to our Marketplaces service offering, our total costs relative to our revenue will be negatively impacted.\nSeparation\nOn August 1, 2014, we completed the separation of Rightside Group, Ltd. ( Rightside\u201d) from Demand Media, Inc., resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies (hereinafter referred to as the Separation\u201d). Following the Separation, Rightside operates our former domain name services business, while we continue to own and operate our Content & Media and Marketplaces businesses. The Separation was structured as a pro rata tax-free dividend involving the distribution of all outstanding shares of Rightside common stock to holders of Demand Media common stock as of the August 1, 2014 record date (the Distribution\u201d). Immediately following the Distribution, we completed a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of our outstanding and treasury shares of common stock. The financial results of Rightside are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods prior to fiscal 2015 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless it is disclosed, all financial results represent continuing operations.\nRevenue\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we reported revenue of $126.0 million, $172.4 million and $209.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Content & Media revenue accounted for 59%, 79% and 93% of our total revenue, respectively, and our Marketplaces revenue accounted for 41%, 21% and 7% of our total revenue, respectively.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of business metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure the performance of our business model, identify trends impacting our business, determine resource allocations, formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions. Measures which we believe are the primary indicators of our performance are as follows:\nContent & Media Metrics\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVisits: We define visits as the total number of times users access our content across (a) one of our owned and operated online properties and/or (b) one of our customers' online properties, to the extent that the visited customer web pages are hosted by our content services.

</tr>\n</table>\nBasis of Presentation\nRevenue\nOur revenue is primarily derived from sales of advertising and from products and services sold through our online marketplaces.\nService Revenue\nContent & Media\nWe generate Content & Media service revenue primarily from advertisements displayed on our online properties and on certain webpages of our content channel customers' online properties that are hosted by our content services. Articles, videos and other forms of content generate advertising revenue from a diverse mix of advertising methods including performance-based cost-per-click advertising, in which an advertiser pays only when a visitor clicks on an advertisement; display advertisements, where revenue is dependent upon the number of advertising impressions delivered; native advertisements, which are advertisements created to match the form and function of the platform on which they appear; sponsored content; or advertising links. At times we enter into revenue-sharing arrangements with our customers, and if we are considered the primary obligor, we report the underlying revenue on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations and record the revenue-sharing payments to our customers in service costs.\nWe also generate Content & Media service revenue from the sale or license of media content, including the creation and distribution of content for third-party brands, advertisers and publishers through our studioD business. Revenue from the sale or perpetual license of media content is recognized when the content has been delivered and the contractual performance obligations have been fulfilled. Revenue from the non-perpetual license of media content is recognized over the period of the license as content is delivered or when other related performance criteria are fulfilled. In circumstances where we distribute our content on third-party properties and the customer acts as the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis. In addition, we previously provided social media services and generated Content & Media service revenue from recurring management support fees, overage fees in excess of standard usage terms, outside consulting fees and initial set-up fees. As of February 2015, we no longer provide social media services.\nMarketplaces\nWe generate service revenue from commissions we receive from facilitating the sale of original art by artists to customers through Saatchi Art. We recognize service revenue arising from the sale of original art net of amounts paid to the artist because we are not the primary obligor in the transaction, we do not have inventory risk, and we do not establish the prices for the art sold. We also recognize this service revenue net of any sales allowances. Revenue is recognized after the original art has been delivered and the return period has expired. Payments received in advance of delivery and completion of the return period are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We periodically provide incentive offers to customers to encourage purchases, including percentage discounts off current purchases, free shipping and other offers. Value-added taxes ( VAT\u201d), sales tax and other taxes are not included in Marketplaces service revenue because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting any such taxes.\nProduct Revenue\nWe recognize product revenue from sales of Society6 products upon delivery, net of estimated returns based on historical experience. Product revenue for Society6 is recognized net of sales allowances and return allowances. We recognize product revenue from the sale of prints through Saatchi Art when the prints are delivered and the return period has expired. Payments received in advance of delivery and, with respect to the Saatchi Art prints, prior to completion of the return period are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Product revenue is recorded at the gross amount due to the following factors: we are the primary obligor in a transaction, we have inventory and credit risk, and we have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers. We periodically provide incentive offers to customers to encourage purchases, including percentage discounts off current purchases, free shipping and other offers. VAT, sales tax and other taxes are not included in product revenue because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting any such taxes.\nService Costs\nService costs consist of payments relating to our Internet connection and co-location charges and other platform operating expenses, including depreciation of the systems and hardware used to build and operate our content creation and distribution platform; expenses related to creating, rewriting, or auditing certain content units; and personnel costs related to in-house editorial, customer service and information technology. Service costs also include payments to our customers pursuant to revenue-sharing arrangements where we are the primary obligor. In the near term, we expect service costs to decrease as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of lower personnel and information technology expenses.\nProduct Costs\nProduct costs consist of outsourced product manufacturing costs, artist royalties, and personnel costs. In the near term, we expect our product costs to remain relatively flat as a percentage of product revenue.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling charged to customers are recorded in service revenue or product revenue, as applicable. Associated costs are recorded in service costs or product costs.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing personnel costs, sales support, public relations, advertising, marketing and general promotional expenditures. Fluctuations in our sales and marketing expenses are generally the result of our efforts to drive growth in our product and service offerings. We currently anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the near term as a percentage of revenue as we grow our marketing activities across all our platforms, especially our studioD and Marketplaces offerings.\nProduct Development\nProduct development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred in our software engineering, product development and web design activities and related personnel costs. Fluctuations in our product development expenses are generally the result of hiring personnel to support and develop our platforms, including the costs to improve our owned and operated online properties and related mobile applications, as well as the costs to develop future product and service offerings. We currently anticipate that our product development expenses will remain relatively flat in the near term as a percentage of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs from our executive, legal, finance, human resources and information technology organizations and facilities related expenditures, as well as third-party professional fees and insurance. Professional fees are largely comprised of outside legal, audit and information technology consulting. We currently anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease in the near term as a percentage of revenue due to managed reduction of expenses.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nWe capitalize certain costs (i) allocated to the purchase price of certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations and (ii) incurred to develop media content that is determined to have a probable economic benefit. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the related expected useful lives of these assets. We determine the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on our historical experience of intangible assets of similar quality and value. In the event of content remediation in future periods, additional accelerated amortization expense may be incurred in the periods such actions occur. We expect amortization expense related to business combinations to decrease in the near term due to fewer acquisitions as compared to prior years. Amortization as a percentage of revenue will depend upon a variety of factors, such as the amounts and mix of our investments in content and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year unless there are interim indicators that suggest that it is more likely than not that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and as of December 31, 2015 we determined that we have two reporting units: content and media and marketplaces. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2015. We may be required to record impairment charges on our remaining goodwill in future periods. For the year ended December 31, 2014, due to unexpected revenue declines attributed to lower traffic and monetization yields on certain of our content and media websites, we lowered our future cash flow expectations. As a result, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of the goodwill in our content and media reporting unit in the third quarter of 2014 and recorded a $232.3 million goodwill impairment charge in 2014.\nStock-based Compensation\nIncluded in operating expenses are expenses associated with stock-based compensation, which are allocated and included in service costs, sales and marketing, product development and general and administrative expenses. Stock-based compensation expense is largely comprised of costs associated with stock options, restricted stock units and\nrestricted stock granted to employees, directors and non-employees, and expenses relating to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We record the fair value of these equity-based awards and expenses at their cost ratably over related vesting periods.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash balances and short-term investments. We typically invest our available cash balances in money market funds and short-term United States Treasury obligations. Interest expense principally consisted of interest on outstanding debt and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our credit facility, which was fully repaid in November 2014.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of transaction gains and losses on foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and gains or losses on sales of businesses. We expect that these gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in underlying currency exchange rates and whether we dispose of any businesses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nSince our inception, we have been subject to income taxes principally in the United States, and certain other countries where we have or had a legal presence, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada and Argentina. We may in the future become subject to taxation in additional countries based on the foreign statutory rates and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe currently believe that based on the available information, it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized, and accordingly we have taken a full valuation allowance against all of our United States federal and certain state and foreign deferred tax assets. Federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an ownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. Currently, we do not expect the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the near term to be materially affected as no significant limitations are expected to be placed on these carry-forwards as a result of our previous ownership changes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with our revenue recognition, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, capitalization and useful lives associated with our intangible assets, discontinued operations, income taxes, stock-based compensation and the recoverability of our long-lived assets including our media content portfolio, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; performance of services has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. We consider persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement to be the receipt of a signed contract. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including transaction history and the credit worthiness of a customer. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. We record cash received in advance of revenue recognition as deferred revenue.\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we allocate revenue to each deliverable if the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The fair value of the selling price for a deliverable is determined using a hierarchy of (1) Company-specific objective and reliable evidence, then (2) third-party evidence, then (3) best estimate of selling price. We allocate any arrangement fee to each of the elements based on their relative selling prices.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables from our customers based on our best estimate of the amount of probable losses from existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on an analysis of historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. In addition, past due balances over 60 days and specific other balances are reviewed individually for collectability on at least a quarterly basis. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense were not significant and we expect that this trend will continue in the near term.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when events or circumstances change in a manner that indicates goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, a decline in our stock price leading to an extended period when our market capitalization is less than the book value of our net assets, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment. During the second quarter of 2015, we made certain changes to our management structure below our chief operating decision maker and, as a result of these changes, we determined that Society6, which had previously been included in our content and media reporting unit, should be combined with the Saatchi Art reporting unit to create a marketplaces reporting unit. A change in reporting units requires that goodwill be tested for impairment. Therefore, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of goodwill for the Saatchi Art reporting unit during the second quarter of 2015 and determined an impairment did not exist. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that we have two reporting units: content and media and marketplaces.\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform step one of a two-step goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit. We are required to perform step one only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying value of its assets. Should this be the case, the first step of the two-step process is to identify whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective carrying values, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\nvalue, then a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The amount of the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its implied fair value. The estimate of implied fair value of goodwill is primarily based on an estimate of the discounted cash flows expected to result from that reporting unit, but may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as our software, technology, patents and trademarks.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, due to unexpected revenue declines attributable to lower traffic and monetization yield on certain of our content and media websites, we lowered our future cash flow expectations. As a result of the decline in our cash flow forecast as well as a sustained decline in our market capitalization which remained at a level below the book value of our net assets for an extended period of time, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of the goodwill in our content and media reporting unit in the third quarter of 2014. Based on our analyses, we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of goodwill for the content and media reporting unit and as a result, we determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill in the content and media reporting unit was zero. Accordingly, we recorded $232.3 million for the goodwill impairment charge in 2014.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of the year, consistent with our existing accounting policy, and we determined that there was no impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there was $10.4 million of goodwill recorded in our marketplaces reporting unit. We may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\nIntangible Assets-Media Content\nWe capitalize the direct costs incurred to acquire our media content that is determined to embody a probable future economic benefit. Costs are recognized as finite-lived intangible assets based on their acquisition cost to us. All costs incurred to deploy and publish content are expensed as incurred, including the costs incurred for the ongoing maintenance of websites on which our content resides. We generally acquire content when our internal systems and processes provide reasonable assurance that, given predicted consumer and advertiser demand relative to our predetermined cost to acquire the content, the content unit will generate revenue over its useful life that exceeds the cost of acquisition. In determining whether content embodies a probable future economic benefit required for asset capitalization, we make judgments and estimates including the forecasted number of visits and the advertising rates that the content will generate. These estimates and judgments take into consideration various inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, total expected visits over the content's useful life; the fact that our content creation and distribution model is evolving and may be impacted by competition and technological advancements; our ability to expand existing and enter into new distribution channels and applications for our content; and whether we will be able to generate similar economic returns from content in the future. Management has reviewed, and intends to regularly review, the operating performance of content in determining probable future economic benefits of our content.\nCapitalized media content is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life, which is typically five years, representing our estimate of when the underlying economic benefits are expected to be realized and based on our estimates of the projected cash flows from advertising revenue expected to be generated by the deployment of such content. These estimates are based on our plans and projections, comparison of the economic returns generated by our content with content of comparable quality and an analysis of historical cash flows generated by that content to date.\nWe continue to perform evaluations of our existing content library to identify potential improvements in our content creation and distribution platform. As a result of these evaluations, we elected to remove certain content units from our content library, resulting in $3.4 million, $7.7 million and $3.1 million of related accelerated amortization expense in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIntangible Assets-Acquired in Business Combinations\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to our respective net tangible and intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets include: trade names, non-compete agreements, owned website names, artist\nrelationships, customer relationships, technology, media content, and content publisher relationships. We use valuation techniques to value these intangibles assets, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions and estimates including projected revenue, operating costs, growth rates, useful lives and discount rates. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed.\nRecoverability of Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived tangible and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Such trigger events or changes in circumstances may include: a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, including those resulting from technology advancements in the industry, the impact of competition or other factors that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse deterioration in the amount of revenue or cash flows we expect to generate from an asset group, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of a long-lived asset, current or future operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset, or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. We perform impairment testing at the asset group level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. Fair value is determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows. Assets to be disposed of, if any, are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated or amortized.\nDiscontinued Operations\nWe report the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations if the disposal of a component represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results. The results of discontinued operations are reported in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for current and prior periods commencing in the period in which the business meets the criteria of a discontinued operation, and include any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.\nOn August 1, 2014, we completed the Separation of Rightside from Demand Media, resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies. Following the Separation, Rightside operates our former domain name services business, while we continue to own and operate our Content & Media and Marketplaces businesses. The financial results of Rightside are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2014 and 2013. We reclassified the following activity in our consolidated statements of operations from continuing operations to discontinued operations (in thousands):\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nService revenue\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n107,721 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n185,187 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nService costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n92,588 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n143,607 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5,632 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n10,170 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct and development\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n8,203 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n12,002 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n14,819 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n20,263 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n4,243 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n7,890 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n125,485 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n193,932 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating loss\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(17,764) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(8,745) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n7,017 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n4,174 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(10,747) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,571) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(461) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,385) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(11,208) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,956) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for our income taxes using the liability and asset method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or in our tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets, and valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We believe any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these audits will not be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax (benefit) provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Our evaluations of uncertain tax positions are based upon their technical merits, and relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees, non-employees and directors based on the grant date fair values of the awards. For stock option awards to employees with service based vesting conditions, the fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The value of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations. We elected to treat stock-based payment awards with graded vesting schedules and time-based service conditions as a single award and recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expenses are classified in the consolidated statement of operations based on the department to which the related employee reports. Our stock-based awards are comprised principally of stock options, restricted stock units and, in the past, restricted stock awards.\nThe Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in determining the fair value of our awards. The most significant assumptions and judgments include the expected volatility, expected term of the award and estimated forfeiture rates.\nWe estimated the expected volatility of our awards from the historical volatility of selected public companies within the Internet and media industry with comparable characteristics to Demand Media, including similarity in size, lines of business, market capitalization, revenue and financial leverage. We calculated the weighted average expected life of our options based upon our historical experience of option exercises combined with estimates of the post-vesting holding period. The-risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with terms approximately equal to the expected life of the option. The expected dividend rate is zero as we currently have no history or expectation of paying cash dividends on our common stock. The forfeiture rate is established based on applicable historical forfeiture patterns adjusted for any expected changes in future periods.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

ended December 31, 2014. Visits decreased by 16% to 3,374 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4,004 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by significant declines in desktop visits across all of our media properties, in part due to management's decision to remove over two million articles on eHow and Livestrong.com. These declines were partially offset by mobile visit growth across most of our media properties. RPV decreased by 36%, to $21.87 in the year ended December 31, 2015 from $34.22 in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower ad monetization yields and a shift to a higher mix of mobile traffic with lower RPV than desktop visits. In addition, the disposition of our Pluck business in the first quarter of 2015 contributed approximately $8.2 million to the decrease in revenue.\nContent & Media revenue decreased by $58.0 million, or 30%, to $137.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $195.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Visits decreased by 1% to 4,004 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2014 from 4,032 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to declines in desktop visits from eHow, Cracked and Livestrong.com, largely offset by mobile visit growth across most of our media properties and desktop visit growth from our international websites and customer web pages hosted by our content channel services. RPV decreased by 29%, to $34.22 in the year ended December 31, 2014 from $48.39 in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to lower ad monetization yields from cost-per-click advertising, a reduction in higher yielding direct sold display advertising, and a mix shift to lower ad monetizing visits from mobile and international users.\nMarketplaces Revenue\nMarketplaces revenue increased by $16.8 million, or 47%, to $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The number of transactions increased 29% to 925,111 in the year ended December 31, 2015 from 715,343 in the prior year period, driven primarily by new product introductions, increased conversion of visits to purchases, and traffic growth on Society6. Average revenue per transaction was $56.38 for the year ended December 31, 2015, increasing by 14% as compared to $49.47 in the prior year period due primarily to a shift towards higher priced items on Society6, as well as the addition of Saatchi Art in August 2014, which has significantly higher average revenue per transaction.\nMarketplaces revenue increased by $21.1 million, or 147%, to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The number of transactions increased 158% to 715,343 in the year ended December 31, 2014 from 277,442 in the prior year period, driven primarily by a full year of results for Society6, which we acquired in June 2013. Average revenue per transaction was $49.47 for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreasing by 4% as compared to $51.65 in the prior year period due to a mix shift that includes lower priced product offerings on Society6.\nCosts and Expenses\nOperating costs and expenses were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nService costs (exclusive of amortization of intangible assets)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,289 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,325 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n51,274 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(14.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(16.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,769 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,058 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,882 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n164.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,319 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,046 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,275 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(45.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct development\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,313 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29,387 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,185 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(9.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,344 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,179 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53,014 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(24.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(5.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGoodwill impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n232,270 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(100.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n100.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,706 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,316 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,519 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(51.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n5.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nService Costs\nService costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by approximately $6.0 million, or 14%, to $37.3 million compared to $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in service costs was primarily due to decreases of $2.1 million in information technology expense, $2.0 million in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, $0.9 million in traffic acquisition costs, $0.8 million in depreciation expense, $0.6 million in ad serving costs, $0.6 million related to newly created content and content renovation, and $0.6 million in consulting expense. The decrease in information technology expense was primarily related to the disposition of our Pluck business and a reduction in colocation, bandwidth and other support costs. These factors were partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in cost of services related to Saatchi Art.\nService costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by approximately $7.9 million, or 16%, to $43.3 million compared to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in service costs was primarily due to decreases of $2.8 million in depreciation expense, $2.4 million in ad serving costs, $1.8 million in traffic acquisition costs, $1.7 million related to newly created content, $1.0 million in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and $0.1 million in information technology expense. These factors were partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in content remediation related expenses.\nProduct Costs\nProduct costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $7.7 million, or 30%, to $33.8 million compared to product costs of $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased costs related to the higher volume of products sold on Society6.\nProduct costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $16.2 million, or 164%, to $26.1 million compared to product costs of $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased costs related to the higher volume of products sold on Society6. The year ended December 31, 2014 represented our first full year of product costs related to Society6, which was acquired in June 2013.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $0.3 million, or 1%, to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in expense was driven by a $2.4 million increase in marketing expenses from Society6 and studioD, partially offset by decreases in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, of $1.7 million and consulting expenses of $0.4 million.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $16.2 million, or 45%, to $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was driven by a $13.1 million decrease in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, primarily due to our shift away from direct advertising sales, a $2.6 million reduction in marketing and branding activities, and a $0.5 million decrease in software licensing fees.\nProduct Development\nProduct development expenses decreased by $5.1 million, or 17%, to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was driven by a $4.8 million reduction in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and a $0.3 million decrease in depreciation expense.\nProduct development expenses decreased by $2.8 million, or 9%, to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was driven by a $2.5 million reduction in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as a $0.3 million decrease in consulting expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $11.8 million, or 24%, to $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $9.3 million in personnel and related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, $1.4 million in legal and audit fees, $0.5 million in facilities costs, and $0.2 million in taxes and insurance costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $2.8 million, or 5%, to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $2.3 million in facilities and related costs, $1.2 million in personnel and related costs, including stock-\nbased compensation expense, and $0.4 million in consulting costs, partially offset by an increase of $0.9 million in depreciation expense.\nSeverance Costs\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, we implemented a number of initiatives to improve operating efficiency, including targeted reductions in force in areas where our business model shifted during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $2.2 million in severance costs primarily related to certain workforce reduction actions that occurred during the year. These severance costs were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 as follows: $1.1 million in product development costs, $0.6 million in service costs, $0.4 million in general and administrative costs, and $0.1 million in sales and marketing costs. Severance costs include severance pay, the provision of certain extended employee benefits, and employer taxes. As of December 31, 2015, there was $0.5 million of accrued severance costs included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We will incur additional severance costs currently estimated to be $0.2 million over the applicable retention periods, which extend through the first quarter of 2016.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $19.6 million, or 51%, to $18.7 million compared to $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the removal of certain content units from our media properties in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the disposition of certain intangible assets in connection with the sales of our Pluck business in the first quarter of 2015 and our Creativebug and CoveritLive businesses in the third quarter of 2014, offset by an increase in amortization expense from intangible assets acquired from the Saatchi Art acquisition in the third quarter of 2014.\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $1.8 million, or 5%, to $38.3 million compared to $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to additional amortization expense from intangible assets acquired from the Society6 acquisition in 2013, as well as an increase in accelerated amortization expense due to our content remediation efforts initiated in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by lower amortization expense of media content due to our removal of certain content units in the fourth quarter of 2013, and reduced amortization due to the disposition of certain intangible assets in connection with certain business disposals.\nGoodwill Impairment Charge\nWe performed our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2015, and based on the results of the annual impairment test there was no goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, due to unexpected revenue declines attributable to lower traffic and monetization yield on certain of our content and media websites, we lowered our future cash flow expectations. As a result of the decline in our cash flow forecast as well as a sustained decline in our market capitalization which remained at a level below the book value of our net assets for an extended period of time, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of the goodwill in our content and media reporting unit in the third quarter of 2014. Based on our analyses, we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of goodwill for the content and media reporting unit and that the implied fair value of the goodwill in the content and media reporting unit was zero. Accordingly, we recorded a $232.3 million goodwill impairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nNet interest income was approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to interest income paid to us on the promissory note we received as part of the consideration for our sale of CoveritLive in July 2014.\nNet interest expense was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $2.8 million from $1.6 million in the same period in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increased balance outstanding under our previous credit facility and a $1.7 million write-off of debt issuance costs associated with terminating our credit facility in November 2014.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nNet other income for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $2.4 million to $3.1 million compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the gain on sale of our Pluck business.\nNet other income for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $0.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a $0.8 million gain on sale from dispositions during the 2014 period.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax expense of $0.1 million compared to an income tax benefit of $14.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The change was primarily due to the tax effect arising from the impairment of goodwill and its impact on our valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2014. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily related to minimal state and foreign income tax expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an income tax benefit of $14.7 million compared to an income tax expense of $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, representing a $17.6 million decrease. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of tax amortization of goodwill from the impairment of goodwill and its impact on our valuation allowance.\nSelected Quarterly Financial Data\nThe following unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations for the quarters in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated annual financial statements, and include, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the financial information contained in those statements. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated annual financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

Internet usage generally slows during the summer months while our marketplaces generally experience increased sales activity during the fourth quarter holiday season. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $38.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, as well as the cash we generate from our operations. Historically, we have principally financed our operations from the issuance of stock, net cash provided by our operating activities and borrowings under our previous credit facilities. In November 2014, we repaid all outstanding amounts under our previous credit facility and terminated that facility, and we do not currently have an available line of credit. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, in order to fund our operations, make potential acquisitions, pursue new business opportunities and invest in our existing businesses, platforms and technologies, we may need to raise additional funds by entering into a new credit facility, selling certain assets or issuing equity, equity-related or debt securities. Our shelf registration statement previously filed with the SEC expired in October 2015.\nSince our inception, we have used significant cash to make strategic acquisitions to grow our business, including the acquisitions of Society6 in June 2013 and Saatchi Art in August 2014. A portion of the purchase price for Society6 was held back by us to secure any post-closing indemnification obligations and/or post-closing adjustments to the purchase price, and in July 2015, we paid $7.4 million in cash and issued an additional 122,638 shares of our common stock to the sellers of Society6 following the expiration of the indemnification holdback period. We have also generated cash since July 2014 by disposing of certain businesses. In July 2014, we sold our Creativebug business for $10.0 million in cash, $1.0 million of which was initially held in escrow and released to us in July 2015. In July 2014, we also sold our CoveritLive social media business for $4.5 million in cash and a promissory note with a principal amount of $5.6 million, originally due in full by July 2016. In September 2015, we agreed to an early repayment of the promissory note and received $5.1 million in cash, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which satisfied all amounts owed to us under the promissory note. In addition, in February 2015 we sold our Pluck social media business for $3.8 million in cash after working capital adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we also sold certain non-core niche online properties for a total of $1.2 million. We may make further acquisitions and dispositions in the future.\nOur cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash-based investments in operations, including working capital, and corporate infrastructure to support our ability to generate revenue and conduct operations. Cash used in investing activities has historically been, and is expected to be, impacted by our ongoing investments in our platforms, company infrastructure and equipment. The following table sets forth our major sources and (uses) of cash for each period as set forth below (in thousands):\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8,438) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n34,661 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n76,163 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,089 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(14,921) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(114,535) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7,886) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(125,418) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n89,030 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nYear ended December 31, 2015\nNet cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was $8.4 million, a decrease of $43.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our net loss during the period was $43.5 million, which included non-cash charges of $37.4 million related to depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, partially offset by gains on disposals of $3.2 million. Cash flow from operating activities was also impacted by a decrease in our working capital, including changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and deferred revenue of $5.0 million, offset in part by changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other long-term assets of $4.1 million. The decrease in our deferred revenue was primarily due to the sale of our Pluck social media business and the sale of other non-core niche media properties during the period. The changes in our accounts receivable and accounts payable were primarily due to the timing of payments and collections.\nYear ended December 31, 2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2014 was $34.7 million, a decrease of $41.5 million compared to the prior year. Our net loss during the period was $267.4 million, which included non-cash charges of $232.3 million for goodwill impairment and $82.9 million related to depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and debt extinguishment, partially offset by deferred taxes, gain on disposals of businesses and properties, gain on other assets, net and other totaling $22.6 million. Cash flow from operating activities was also impacted by a decrease in our working capital, including changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue of $22.8 million, offset in part by changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred registration costs, other long-term assets and deposits with registries of $13.3 million. The increase in our deferred revenue was primarily due to growth in our former registrar service during the period. The decrease in accrued expenses is reflective of increases in amounts due to certain vendors and our employees resulting from growth in our business, while the changes in our accounts receivable and accounts payable were primarily due to the timing of payments and collections.\nYear ended December 31, 2013\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2013 was $76.2 million, a decrease of $14.8 million compared to the prior year. Our net loss during the period was $20.2 million, which included non-cash charges of $96.2 million related to depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and deferred taxes, partially offset by gain on other assets, net and other of $5.1 million.

$96.3 million under our previous credit facility, partially offset by debt issuance costs of $1.9 million incurred related to the credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received proceeds of $4.7 million from the exercise of employee stock options and contributions from participants in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and we incurred $4.6 million of costs related to net taxes paid on employee stock options exercises and restricted stock units vesting. In addition, we repurchased 0.6 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase plan at a cost of $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nService costs consist of payments relating to our Internet connection and co-location charges and other platform operating expenses, including depreciation of the systems and hardware used to build and operate our content creation and distribution platform; expenses related to creating, rewriting, or auditing certain content units; and personnel costs related to in-house editorial, customer service and information technology. Service costs also include payments to our customers pursuant to revenue-sharing arrangements where we are the primary obligor. In the near term, we expect service costs to decrease as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of lower personnel and information technology expenses.\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

decreased by $16.2 million, or 45%, to $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was driven by a $13.1 million decrease in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, primarily due to our shift away from direct advertising sales, a $2.6 million reduction in marketing and branding activities, and a $0.5 million decrease in software licensing fees.\nProduct costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $16.2 million, or 164%, to $26.1 million compared to product costs of $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased costs related to the higher volume of products sold on Society6. The year ended December 31, 2014 represented our first full year of product costs related to Society6, which was acquired in June 2013.\nNet other income for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $0.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a $0.8 million gain on sale from dispositions during the 2014 period.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

our software engineering, product development and web design activities and related personnel costs. Fluctuations in our product development expenses are generally the result of hiring personnel to support and develop our platforms, including the costs to improve our owned and operated online properties and related mobile applications, as well as the costs to develop future product and service offerings. We currently anticipate that our product development expenses will remain relatively flat in the near term as a percentage of revenue.\nThrough our Marketplaces service offering, we operate two leading art and design marketplaces where large communities of artists can market and sell their original artwork or their original designs printed on a wide variety of products. Society6 provides artists with an online commerce platform to feature and sell their original designs on a wide variety of consumer and home d\u00e9cor products such as art prints, phone and tablet cases, t-shirts and throw pillows. Saatchi Art is an online art gallery featuring a wide selection of original paintings, drawings, sculptures and photography that provides a global community of artists a curated environment in which to exhibit and sell their work directly to customers around the world.\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $19.6 million, or 51%, to $18.7 million compared to $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the removal of certain content units from our media properties in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the disposition of certain intangible assets in connection with the sales of our Pluck business in the first quarter of 2015 and our Creativebug and CoveritLive businesses in the third quarter of 2014, offset by an increase in amortization expense from intangible assets acquired from the Saatchi Art acquisition in the third quarter of 2014.\nYear ended December 31, 2015\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

We reclassified the following activity in our consolidated statements of operations from continuing operations to discontinued operations (in thousands):\nContent & Media revenue decreased by $58.0 million, or 30%, to $137.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $195.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Visits decreased by 1% to 4,004 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2014 from 4,032 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to declines in desktop visits from eHow, Cracked and Livestrong.com, largely offset by mobile visit growth across most of our media properties and desktop visit growth from our international websites and customer web pages hosted by our content channel services. RPV decreased by 29%, to $34.22 in the year ended December 31, 2014 from $48.39 in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to lower ad monetization yields from cost-per-click advertising, a reduction in higher yielding direct sold display advertising, and a mix shift to lower ad monetizing visits from mobile and international users.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform step one of a two-step goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit. We are required to perform step one only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying value of its assets. Should this be the case, the first step of the two-step process is to identify whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective carrying values, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nWe test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year unless there are interim indicators that suggest that it is more likely than not that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and as of December 31, 2015 we determined that we have two reporting units: content and media and marketplaces. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2015. We may be required to record impairment charges on our remaining goodwill in future periods. For the year ended December 31, 2014, due to unexpected revenue declines attributed to lower traffic and monetization yields on certain of our content and media websites, we lowered our future cash flow expectations. As a result, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of the goodwill in our content and media reporting unit in the third quarter of 2014 and recorded a $232.3 million goodwill impairment charge in 2014.\nService costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by approximately $6.0 million, or 14%, to $37.3 million compared to $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in service costs was primarily due to decreases of $2.1 million in information technology expense, $2.0 million in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, $0.9 million in traffic acquisition costs, $0.8 million in depreciation expense, $0.6 million in ad serving costs, $0.6 million related to newly created content and content renovation, and $0.6 million in consulting expense. The decrease in information technology expense was primarily related to the disposition of our Pluck business and a reduction in colocation, bandwidth and other support costs. These factors were partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in cost of services related to Saatchi Art.\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash balances and short-term investments. We typically invest our available cash balances in money market funds and short-term United States Treasury obligations. Interest expense principally consisted of interest on outstanding debt and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our credit facility, which was fully repaid in November 2014.\n\nService costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by approximately $7.9 million, or 16%, to $43.3 million compared to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in service costs was primarily due to decreases of $2.8 million in depreciation expense, $2.4 million in ad serving costs, $1.8 million in traffic acquisition costs, $1.7 million related to newly created content, $1.0 million in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and $0.1 million in information technology expense. These factors were partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in content remediation related expenses.\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing personnel costs, sales support, public relations, advertising, marketing and general promotional expenditures. Fluctuations in our sales and marketing expenses are generally the result of our efforts to drive growth in our product and service offerings. We currently anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the near term as a percentage of revenue as we grow our marketing activities across all our platforms, especially our studioD and Marketplaces offerings.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe generate Content & Media service revenue primarily from advertisements displayed on our online properties and on certain webpages of our content channel customers' online properties that are hosted by our content services. Articles, videos and other forms of content generate advertising revenue from a diverse mix of advertising methods including performance-based cost-per-click advertising, in which an advertiser pays only when a visitor clicks on an advertisement; display advertisements, where revenue is dependent upon the number of advertising impressions delivered; native advertisements, which are advertisements created to match the form and function of the platform on which they appear; sponsored content; or advertising links. At times we enter into revenue-sharing arrangements with our customers, and if we are considered the primary obligor, we report the underlying revenue on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations and record the revenue-sharing payments to our customers in service costs.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nWe currently believe that based on the available information, it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized, and accordingly we have taken a full valuation allowance against all of our United States federal and certain state and foreign deferred tax assets. Federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an ownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. Currently, we do not expect the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the near term to be materially affected as no significant limitations are expected to be placed on these carry-forwards as a result of our previous ownership changes.\nCapital Expenditures\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $125.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily comprised of $96.3 million used to repay all amounts outstanding under our previous credit facility and $24.1 million used to capitalize Rightside in connection with the Separation. We also used $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to fund acquisition holdbacks related to our acquisitions of Name.com, Creativebug and Society6. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we also incurred $2.9 million of costs related to net taxes paid on employee stock options exercises and restricted stock units vesting and we received proceeds of $0.5 million from the exercise of employee stock options and contributions from participants in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nOn August 1, 2014, we completed the separation of Rightside Group, Ltd. ( Rightside\u201d) from Demand Media, Inc., resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies (hereinafter referred to as the Separation\u201d). Following the Separation, Rightside operates our former domain name services business, while we continue to own and operate our Content & Media and Marketplaces businesses. The Separation was structured as a pro rata tax-free dividend involving the distribution of all outstanding shares of Rightside common stock to holders of Demand Media common stock as of the August 1, 2014 record date (the Distribution\u201d). Immediately following the Distribution, we completed a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of our outstanding and treasury shares of common stock. The financial results of Rightside are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods prior to fiscal 2015 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless it is disclosed, all financial results represent continuing operations.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when events or circumstances change in a manner that indicates goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, a decline in our stock price leading to an extended period when our market capitalization is less than the book value of our net assets, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\n\nStock-based Compensation\nNet cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was $8.4 million, a decrease of $43.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our net loss during the period was $43.5 million, which included non-cash charges of $37.4 million related to depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, partially offset by gains on disposals of $3.2 million. Cash flow from operating activities was also impacted by a decrease in our working capital, including changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and deferred revenue of $5.0 million, offset in part by changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other long-term assets of $4.1 million. The decrease in our deferred revenue was primarily due to the sale of our Pluck social media business and the sale of other non-core niche media properties during the period. The changes in our accounts receivable and accounts payable were primarily due to the timing of payments and collections.\nIntangible Assets-Media Content\nNet cash used in investing activities was $114.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, and included $73.6 million of cash paid as partial consideration to acquire Society6 and Creativebug, investments of $16.8 million in intangible assets, primarily comprised of media content, and investments of $26.7 million in property and equipment, primarily comprised of servers and IT equipment, fixtures and fittings, leasehold improvements and internally developed software. In connection with our former domain name business, we made net payments for gTLD applications of $3.9 million and received cash proceeds of $5.6 million from the withdrawals of our interest in certain gTLD applications during the year ended December 31, 2013.\n\nWe recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; performance of services has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. We consider persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement to be the receipt of a signed contract. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including transaction history and the credit worthiness of a customer. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. We record cash received in advance of revenue recognition as deferred revenue.\nThe revenue generated by our Marketplaces service offering has higher costs associated with it as compared to our Content & Media service offering due to variable product costs, including outsourced product manufacturing costs, artist royalties, marketing costs, and shipping and handling costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, a higher percentage of our total revenue was generated by our Marketplaces service offering as compared to the prior year. If our revenue sources continue to shift from our Content & Media service offering to our Marketplaces service offering, our total costs relative to our revenue will be negatively impacted.\nNet other income for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $2.4 million to $3.1 million compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the gain on sale of our Pluck business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we reported revenue of $126.0 million, $172.4 million and $209.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Content & Media revenue accounted for 59%, 79% and 93% of our total revenue, respectively, and our Marketplaces revenue accounted for 41%, 21% and 7% of our total revenue, respectively.\nNet interest expense was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $2.8 million from $1.6 million in the same period in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increased balance outstanding under our previous credit facility and a $1.7 million write-off of debt issuance costs associated with terminating our credit facility in November 2014.\n \u00b7 Revenue per visit ( RPV\u201d): We define RPV as Content & Media revenue per one thousand visits. \nService Costs\nSince our inception, we have used significant cash to make strategic acquisitions to grow our business, including the acquisitions of Society6 in June 2013 and Saatchi Art in August 2014. A portion of the purchase price for Society6 was held back by us to secure any post-closing indemnification obligations and/or post-closing adjustments to the purchase price, and in July 2015, we paid $7.4 million in cash and issued an additional 122,638 shares of our common stock to the sellers of Society6 following the expiration of the indemnification holdback period. We have also generated cash since July 2014 by disposing of certain businesses. In July 2014, we sold our Creativebug business for $10.0 million in cash, $1.0 million of which was initially held in escrow and released to us in July 2015. In July 2014, we also sold our CoveritLive social media business for $4.5 million in cash and a promissory note with a principal amount of $5.6 million, originally due in full by July 2016. In September 2015, we agreed to an early repayment of the promissory note and received $5.1 million in cash, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which satisfied all amounts owed to us under the promissory note. In addition, in February 2015 we sold our Pluck social media business for $3.8 million in cash after working capital adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we also sold certain non-core niche online properties for a total of $1.2 million. We may make further acquisitions and dispositions in the future.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nMarketplaces revenue increased by $21.1 million, or 147%, to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The number of transactions increased 158% to 715,343 in the year ended December 31, 2014 from 277,442 in the prior year period, driven primarily by a full year of results for Society6, which we acquired in June 2013. Average revenue per transaction was $49.47 for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreasing by 4% as compared to $51.65 in the prior year period due to a mix shift that includes lower priced product offerings on Society6.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2014 was $34.7 million, a decrease of $41.5 million compared to the prior year. Our net loss during the period was $267.4 million, which included non-cash charges of $232.3 million for goodwill impairment and $82.9 million related to depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and debt extinguishment, partially offset by deferred taxes, gain on disposals of businesses and properties, gain on other assets, net and other totaling $22.6 million. Cash flow from operating activities was also impacted by a decrease in our working capital, including changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue of $22.8 million, offset in part by changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred registration costs, other long-term assets and deposits with registries of $13.3 million. The increase in our deferred revenue was primarily due to growth in our former registrar service during the period. The decrease in accrued expenses is reflective of increases in amounts due to certain vendors and our employees resulting from growth in our business, while the changes in our accounts receivable and accounts payable were primarily due to the timing of payments and collections.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $0.3 million, or 1%, to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in expense was driven by a $2.4 million increase in marketing expenses from Society6 and studioD, partially offset by decreases in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, of $1.7 million and consulting expenses of $0.4 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily comprised of $7.6 million of cash paid for acquisition holdbacks from prior year acquisitions and $0.7 million of costs related to net taxes paid on exercises of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock units. We received proceeds of $0.5 million from the exercise of employee stock options and contributions from participants in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOur revenue is primarily derived from sales of advertising and from products and services sold through our online marketplaces.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe report the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations if the disposal of a component represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results. The results of discontinued operations are reported in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for current and prior periods commencing in the period in which the business meets the criteria of a discontinued operation, and include any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.\nProduct development expenses decreased by $2.8 million, or 9%, to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was driven by a $2.5 million reduction in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as a $0.3 million decrease in consulting expense.\nProduct costs consist of outsourced product manufacturing costs, artist royalties, and personnel costs. In the near term, we expect our product costs to remain relatively flat as a percentage of product revenue.\nvalue, then a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The amount of the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its implied fair value. The estimate of implied fair value of goodwill is primarily based on an estimate of the discounted cash flows expected to result from that reporting unit, but may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as our software, technology, patents and trademarks.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and included investments of $8.9 million in property and equipment, primarily comprised of servers and IT equipment, fixtures and fittings, leasehold improvements and internally developed software, and investments of $5.7 million in intangible assets, primarily composed of media content. Cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 also included cash inflows of $13.7 million from the sales of businesses, including Creativebug and CoveritLive, as well as outflows of $2.2 million as partial consideration to acquire Saatchi Art, and $3.1 million of restricted cash comprised of a $1.7 million holdback amount paid by us as part of the Saatchi Art consideration and $1.4 million for a standby letter of credit we cash collateralized in connection with the payment arrangement for our Santa Monica office lease. In connection with our former domain name business, we made net payments for gTLD applications of $15.8 million and received cash proceeds of $6.1 million from the withdrawals of our interest in certain gTLD applications during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe capitalize certain costs (i) allocated to the purchase price of certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations and (ii) incurred to develop media content that is determined to have a probable economic benefit. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the related expected useful lives of these assets. We determine the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on our historical experience of intangible assets of similar quality and value. In the event of content remediation in future periods, additional accelerated amortization expense may be incurred in the periods such actions occur. We expect amortization expense related to business combinations to decrease in the near term due to fewer acquisitions as compared to prior years. Amortization as a percentage of revenue will depend upon a variety of factors, such as the amounts and mix of our investments in content and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived tangible and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Such trigger events or changes in circumstances may include: a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, including those resulting from technology advancements in the industry, the impact of competition or other factors that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse deterioration in the amount of revenue or cash flows we expect to generate from an asset group, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of a long-lived asset, current or future operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset, or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. We perform impairment testing at the asset group level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. Fair value is determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows. Assets to be disposed of, if any, are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated or amortized.\nRevenue\nOur Marketplaces service offering generates revenue from the sale of products and services through our art and design marketplaces. On Society6, revenue is generated from the sale of print-on-demand products. Saatchi Art primarily generates revenue through commissions on the final sale price of original works of art. Our Marketplaces service offering is principally dependent on the number of transactions and average revenue per transaction generated by products and services sold through our online marketplaces. We believe there are opportunities to increase the number of transactions and the average revenue per transaction by attracting new visitors to our marketplaces via diverse online and offline marketing, improving conversion of visitors to purchasing customers, continuing to introduce new products, and offering product bundling and other promotions.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax (benefit) provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Our evaluations of uncertain tax positions are based upon their technical merits, and relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nRecoverability of Long-lived Assets\nWe estimated the expected volatility of our awards from the historical volatility of selected public companies within the Internet and media industry with comparable characteristics to Demand Media, including similarity in size, lines of business, market capitalization, revenue and financial leverage. We calculated the weighted average expected life of our options based upon our historical experience of option exercises combined with estimates of the post-vesting holding period. The-risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with terms approximately equal to the expected life of the option. The expected dividend rate is zero as we currently have no history or expectation of paying cash dividends on our common stock. The forfeiture rate is established based on applicable historical forfeiture patterns adjusted for any expected changes in future periods.\nProduct Costs\nYear ended December 31, 2013\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2015\nOverview\nWe believe that there are opportunities to increase the number of visits to our online properties, both from direct visits by users and search engine referrals, by building high-quality products that provide a better user experience and lead to increased engagement. Since 2013, we have focused our efforts on redesigning our websites; refining our content library; rationalizing ad unit density; and developing a greater variety of content formats, particularly formats better suited for mobile devices. We have also recently started a new initiative to work with a network of contributors and influencers to create more authoritative and engaging content. These changes could negatively impact revenue and increase our operating expenses in the near term, but we believe that by providing consumers with an improved user and content experience, we will be able to increase the number of visits and revenue in a sustained fashion over the long-term. We also believe there are opportunities to increase our advertising revenue by optimizing our ad product stack and increasing branded ad sales through direct sellers and by offering more innovative products such as native advertisements and sponsored ad placements. However, if the overall ad unit rates we receive continue to decline, we could experience lower advertising revenue even if the number of visits to our properties increases.\nProduct development expenses decreased by $5.1 million, or 17%, to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was driven by a $4.8 million reduction in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and a $0.3 million decrease in depreciation expense.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nIn the normal course of business, we have provided certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities include intellectual property indemnities to our customers, indemnities to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of Delaware, indemnifications related to our lease agreements and indemnifications to sellers or buyers in connection with acquisitions and dispositions, respectively. In addition, our advertiser, content creation and distribution partner agreements contain certain indemnification provisions, which are generally consistent with those prevalent in our industry. We have not incurred significant obligations under indemnification provisions historically, and do not expect to incur significant obligations in the future. Accordingly, we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $2.8 million, or 5%, to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $2.3 million in facilities and related costs, $1.2 million in personnel and related costs, including stock-\nIncome Taxes\nProduct Development\nRevenue\nYear ended December 31, 2014\nGeneral and Administrative\n\n\nYear ended December 31, 2013\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of the year, consistent with our existing accounting policy, and we determined that there was no impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there was $10.4 million of goodwill recorded in our marketplaces reporting unit. We may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\nDiscontinued Operations\nSales and Marketing\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we allocate revenue to each deliverable if the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The fair value of the selling price for a deliverable is determined using a hierarchy of (1) Company-specific objective and reliable evidence, then (2) third-party evidence, then (3) best estimate of selling price. We allocate any arrangement fee to each of the elements based on their relative selling prices.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nRevenue\nHistorically, the majority of our advertising revenue has been generated by our relationship with Google. While Google continues to be our primary ad vendor for ad monetization, in 2015 we began to significantly diversify our monetization partners and will continue to do so going forward. Google also serves as one of our primary technology\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax expense of $0.1 million compared to an income tax benefit of $14.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The change was primarily due to the tax effect arising from the impairment of goodwill and its impact on our valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2014. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily related to minimal state and foreign income tax expenses.\nSelected Quarterly Financial Data\nKey Business Metrics\n (1) For a description of the method used to compute our basic and diluted net income (loss) per share, refer to note 7 in Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data.\u201d \nContractual Obligations\nYear ended December 31, 2015\nSee Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part III, Item 15, Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeverance Costs\nIntangible Assets-Acquired in Business Combinations\nGoodwill\n \u00b7 Average revenue per transaction: We calculate average revenue per transaction by dividing Marketplaces revenue for a period by the number of transactions in that period. \nMarketplaces Revenue\nOur Content & Media service offering derives the majority of its revenue from the sale of advertising on our online properties. Our advertising revenue is principally dependent on the number of visits to our properties and the corresponding ad unit rates. Since 2011, the total number of visits to our properties, particularly eHow, has substantially declined due to lower search engine referrals resulting from ongoing changes to search engine algorithms by Google, Yahoo! and Bing, as well as our decision to remove low quality and duplicative content. We have also experienced lower ad monetization due to industry declines in cost-per-click ad rates and our decision to reduce the number of ads per page on certain articles. In addition, visits across our online properties continue to shift from desktop to mobile, with ad unit rates for mobile generally lower than desktop. Future changes to search engine algorithms that negatively impact the volume of referral traffic, declines in ad unit rates, or increased availability of ad blocking software, particularly on mobile devices, could result in a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, due to unexpected revenue declines attributable to lower traffic and monetization yield on certain of our content and media websites, we lowered our future cash flow expectations. As a result of the decline in our cash flow forecast as well as a sustained decline in our market capitalization which remained at a level below the book value of our net assets for an extended period of time, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of the goodwill in our content and media reporting unit in the third quarter of 2014. Based on our analyses, we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of goodwill for the content and media reporting unit and that the implied fair value of the goodwill in the content and media reporting unit was zero. Accordingly, we recorded a $232.3 million goodwill impairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nContent & Media Revenue\nShipping and Handling\nBasis of Presentation\nSince our inception, we have been subject to income taxes principally in the United States, and certain other countries where we have or had a legal presence, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada and Argentina. We may in the future become subject to taxation in additional countries based on the foreign statutory rates and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.\nProduct Revenue\nThe following table sets forth our key business metrics for the periods presented:\nYear ended December 31, 2013\nSeparation\nIndemnifications\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we used $4.7 million, $8.9 million and $26.7 million, respectively, in cash to fund capital expenditures to create internally developed software, fund leasehold improvements and purchase servers, IT equipment and fixtures and fittings. We currently anticipate making capital expenditures between $4.0 million and $8.0 million during the year ending December 31, 2016.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nProduct Costs\nIncluded in operating expenses are expenses associated with stock-based compensation, which are allocated and included in service costs, sales and marketing, product development and general and administrative expenses. Stock-based compensation expense is largely comprised of costs associated with stock options, restricted stock units and\nYear ended December 31, 2014\nProduct costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $7.7 million, or 30%, to $33.8 million compared to product costs of $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased costs related to the higher volume of products sold on Society6.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n\nWe performed our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2015, and based on the results of the annual impairment test there was no goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nYear ended December 31, 2014\nplatform partners in connection with our programmatic ad sales offering. Any change in the type of services that Google provides to us, or to the terms of our agreements with Google, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nContent & Media\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an income tax benefit of $14.7 million compared to an income tax expense of $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, representing a $17.6 million decrease. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of tax amortization of goodwill from the impairment of goodwill and its impact on our valuation allowance.\nService Costs\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees, non-employees and directors based on the grant date fair values of the awards. For stock option awards to employees with service based vesting conditions, the fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The value of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations. We elected to treat stock-based payment awards with graded vesting schedules and time-based service conditions as a single award and recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expenses are classified in the consolidated statement of operations based on the department to which the related employee reports. Our stock-based awards are comprised principally of stock options, restricted stock units and, in the past, restricted stock awards.\nGoodwill Impairment Charge\nContent & Media\nCosts and Expenses\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of transaction gains and losses on foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and gains or losses on sales of businesses. We expect that these gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in underlying currency exchange rates and whether we dispose of any businesses.\nOur cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash-based investments in operations, including working capital, and corporate infrastructure to support our ability to generate revenue and conduct operations. Cash used in investing activities has historically been, and is expected to be, impacted by our ongoing investments in our platforms, company infrastructure and equipment. The following table sets forth our major sources and (uses) of cash for each period as set forth below (in thousands):\nMarketplaces revenue increased by $16.8 million, or 47%, to $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The number of transactions increased 29% to 925,111 in the year ended December 31, 2015 from 715,343 in the prior year period, driven primarily by new product introductions, increased conversion of visits to purchases, and traffic growth on Society6. Average revenue per transaction was $56.38 for the year ended December 31, 2015, increasing by 14% as compared to $49.47 in the prior year period due primarily to a shift towards higher priced items on Society6, as well as the addition of Saatchi Art in August 2014, which has significantly higher average revenue per transaction.\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables from our customers based on our best estimate of the amount of probable losses from existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on an analysis of historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. In addition, past due balances over 60 days and specific other balances are reviewed individually for collectability on at least a quarterly basis. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense were not significant and we expect that this trend will continue in the near term.\n\nNet interest income was approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to interest income paid to us on the promissory note we received as part of the consideration for our sale of CoveritLive in July 2014.\nMarketplaces\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to our respective net tangible and intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets include: trade names, non-compete agreements, owned website names, artist\nCapitalized media content is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life, which is typically five years, representing our estimate of when the underlying economic benefits are expected to be realized and based on our estimates of the projected cash flows from advertising revenue expected to be generated by the deployment of such content. These estimates are based on our plans and projections, comparison of the economic returns generated by our content with content of comparable quality and an analysis of historical cash flows generated by that content to date.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs from our executive, legal, finance, human resources and information technology organizations and facilities related expenditures, as well as third-party professional fees and insurance. Professional fees are largely comprised of outside legal, audit and information technology consulting. We currently anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease in the near term as a percentage of revenue due to managed reduction of expenses.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nMarketplaces\nAs a percentage of revenue:\n (2) During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we identified through our internal processes that our property and equipment, net was overstated because certain capitalized internally developed software costs had not been placed into service and certain write-offs were not identified on a timely basis. As such, during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we recorded an out of period adjustment which increased depreciation by $0.6 million and decreased Other income, net\u201d by $0.5 million. \nSeasonality of Quarterly Results\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, we implemented a number of initiatives to improve operating efficiency, including targeted reductions in force in areas where our business model shifted during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $2.2 million in severance costs primarily related to certain workforce reduction actions that occurred during the year. These severance costs were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 as follows: $1.1 million in product development costs, $0.6 million in service costs, $0.4 million in general and administrative costs, and $0.1 million in sales and marketing costs. Severance costs include severance pay, the provision of certain extended employee benefits, and employer taxes. As of December 31, 2015, there was $0.5 million of accrued severance costs included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We will incur additional severance costs currently estimated to be $0.2 million over the applicable retention periods, which extend through the first quarter of 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nMarketplaces Metrics\n (1) For a discussion of these period-to-period changes in the number of visits, RPV, number of transactions and average revenue per transaction and how they impacted our financial results, see Results of Operations\u201d below. \nrestricted stock granted to employees, directors and non-employees, and expenses relating to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We record the fair value of these equity-based awards and expenses at their cost ratably over related vesting periods.\nWe are a diversified Internet company that builds platforms across its media and marketplaces properties to enable communities of creators to reach passionate audiences in large and growing lifestyle categories. Our business is comprised of two service offerings: Content & Media and Marketplaces.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2013 was $76.2 million, a decrease of $14.8 million compared to the prior year. Our net loss during the period was $20.2 million, which included non-cash charges of $96.2 million related to depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and deferred taxes, partially offset by gain on other assets, net and other of $5.1 million. Cash flow from operating activities was also impacted by an increase in our working capital, including changes in accounts receivable, deferred revenue and accounts payable of $24.8 million, offset in part by changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets, accrued expenses, other long-term assets, deferred registration costs, and deposits with registries of $19.6 million. The increases in our deferred revenue and deferred registration costs were primarily due to growth in our former registrar business during the period, while the decrease in our accounts receivable balances was primarily due to timing of collections.\nOn August 1, 2014, we completed the Separation of Rightside from Demand Media, resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies. Following the Separation, Rightside operates our former domain name services business, while we continue to own and operate our Content & Media and Marketplaces businesses. The financial results of Rightside are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended\nRevenue by service offering was as follows (in thousands):\nrelationships, customer relationships, technology, media content, and content publisher relationships. We use valuation techniques to value these intangibles assets, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions and estimates including projected revenue, operating costs, growth rates, useful lives and discount rates. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed.\n\nWe recognize product revenue from sales of Society6 products upon delivery, net of estimated returns based on historical experience. Product revenue for Society6 is recognized net of sales allowances and return allowances. We recognize product revenue from the sale of prints through Saatchi Art when the prints are delivered and the return period has expired. Payments received in advance of delivery and, with respect to the Saatchi Art prints, prior to completion of the return period are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Product revenue is recorded at the gross amount due to the following factors: we are the primary obligor in a transaction, we have inventory and credit risk, and we have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers. We periodically provide incentive offers to customers to encourage purchases, including percentage discounts off current purchases, free shipping and other offers. VAT, sales tax and other taxes are not included in product revenue because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting any such taxes.\nGeneral and Administrative\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nWe also generate Content & Media service revenue from the sale or license of media content, including the creation and distribution of content for third-party brands, advertisers and publishers through our studioD business. Revenue from the sale or perpetual license of media content is recognized when the content has been delivered and the contractual performance obligations have been fulfilled. Revenue from the non-perpetual license of media content is recognized over the period of the license as content is delivered or when other related performance criteria are fulfilled. In circumstances where we distribute our content on third-party properties and the customer acts as the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis. In addition, we previously provided social media services and generated Content & Media service revenue from recurring management support fees, overage fees in excess of standard usage terms, outside consulting fees and initial set-up fees. As of February 2015, we no longer provide social media services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, due to unexpected revenue declines attributable to lower traffic and monetization yield on certain of our content and media websites, we lowered our future cash flow expectations. As a result of the decline in our cash flow forecast as well as a sustained decline in our market capitalization which remained at a level below the book value of our net assets for an extended period of time, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of the goodwill in our content and media reporting unit in the third quarter of 2014. Based on our analyses, we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of goodwill for the content and media reporting unit and as a result, we determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill in the content and media reporting unit was zero. Accordingly, we recorded $232.3 million for the goodwill impairment charge in 2014.\nRevenue Recognition\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $1.8 million, or 5%, to $38.3 million compared to $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to additional amortization expense from intangible assets acquired from the Society6 acquisition in 2013, as well as an increase in accelerated amortization expense due to our content remediation efforts initiated in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by lower amortization expense of media content due to our removal of certain content units in the fourth quarter of 2013, and reduced amortization due to the disposition of certain intangible assets in connection with certain business disposals.\nIncluded in operating lease obligations are agreements to lease our primary office space in Santa Monica, California and other locations under various operating leases that have non-cancelable periods ending between February 2018 and February 2020.\nWe capitalize the direct costs incurred to acquire our media content that is determined to embody a probable future economic benefit. Costs are recognized as finite-lived intangible assets based on their acquisition cost to us. All costs incurred to deploy and publish content are expensed as incurred, including the costs incurred for the ongoing maintenance of websites on which our content resides. We generally acquire content when our internal systems and processes provide reasonable assurance that, given predicted consumer and advertiser demand relative to our predetermined cost to acquire the content, the content unit will generate revenue over its useful life that exceeds the cost of acquisition. In determining whether content embodies a probable future economic benefit required for asset capitalization, we make judgments and estimates including the forecasted number of visits and the advertising rates that the content will generate. These estimates and judgments take into consideration various inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, total expected visits over the content's useful life; the fact that our content creation and distribution model is evolving and may be impacted by competition and technological advancements; our ability to expand existing and enter into new distribution channels and applications for our content; and whether we will be able to generate similar economic returns from content in the future. Management has reviewed, and intends to regularly review, the operating performance of content in determining probable future economic benefits of our content.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nAt December 31, 2015, we had a cash collateralized standby letter of credit for approximately $1.2 million associated with one of our leases.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $38.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, as well as the cash we generate from our operations. Historically, we have principally financed our operations from the issuance of stock, net cash provided by our operating activities and borrowings under our previous credit facilities. In November 2014, we repaid all outstanding amounts under our previous credit facility and terminated that facility, and we do not currently have an available line of credit. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, in order to fund our operations, make potential acquisitions, pursue new business opportunities and invest in our existing businesses, platforms and technologies, we may need to raise additional funds by entering into a new credit facility, selling certain assets or issuing equity, equity-related or debt securities. Our shelf registration statement previously filed with the SEC expired in October 2015.\nThe following unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations for the quarters in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated annual financial statements, and include, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the financial information contained in those statements. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated annual financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill\nContent & Media revenue decreased by $63.2 million, or 46%, to $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $137.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Visits decreased by 16% to 3,374 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4,004 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by significant declines in desktop visits across all of our media properties, in part due to management's decision to remove over two million articles on eHow and Livestrong.com. These declines were partially offset by mobile visit growth across most of our media properties. RPV decreased by 36%, to $21.87 in the year ended December 31, 2015 from $34.22 in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower ad monetization yields and a shift to a higher mix of mobile traffic with lower RPV than desktop visits. In addition, the disposition of our Pluck business in the first quarter of 2015 contributed approximately $8.2 million to the decrease in revenue.\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item I, Part 1A, Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u00b7 Visits: We define visits as the total number of times users access our content across (a) one of our owned and operated online properties and/or (b) one of our customers' online properties, to the extent that the visited customer web pages are hosted by our content services. In each case, breaks of access of at least 30 minutes constitute a unique visit. \nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nService Revenue\nWe regularly review a number of business metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure the performance of our business model, identify trends impacting our business, determine resource allocations, formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions. Measures which we believe are the primary indicators of our performance are as follows:\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment. During the second quarter of 2015, we made certain changes to our management structure below our chief operating decision maker and, as a result of these changes, we determined that Society6, which had previously been included in our content and media reporting unit, should be combined with the Saatchi Art reporting unit to create a marketplaces reporting unit. A change in reporting units requires that goodwill be tested for impairment. Therefore, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of goodwill for the Saatchi Art reporting unit during the second quarter of 2015 and determined an impairment did not exist. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that we have two reporting units: content and media and marketplaces.\nWe account for our income taxes using the liability and asset method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or in our tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets, and valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We believe any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these audits will not be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe generate service revenue from commissions we receive from facilitating the sale of original art by artists to customers through Saatchi Art. We recognize service revenue arising from the sale of original art net of amounts paid to the artist because we are not the primary obligor in the transaction, we do not have inventory risk, and we do not establish the prices for the art sold. We also recognize this service revenue net of any sales allowances. Revenue is recognized after the original art has been delivered and the return period has expired. Payments received in advance of delivery and completion of the return period are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We periodically provide incentive offers to customers to encourage purchases, including percentage discounts off current purchases, free shipping and other offers. Value-added taxes ( VAT\u201d), sales tax and other taxes are not included in Marketplaces service revenue because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting any such taxes.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $11.8 million, or 24%, to $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $9.3 million in personnel and related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, $1.4 million in legal and audit fees, $0.5 million in facilities costs, and $0.2 million in taxes and insurance costs.\nbased compensation expense, and $0.4 million in consulting costs, partially offset by an increase of $0.9 million in depreciation expense.", "item_7_text": "Shipping and handling charged to customers are recorded in service revenue or product revenue, as applicable. Associated costs are recorded in service costs or product costs.\nOperating costs and expenses were as follows (in thousands):\nWe continue to perform evaluations of our existing content library to identify potential improvements in our content creation and distribution platform. As a result of these evaluations, we elected to remove certain content units from our content library, resulting in $3.4 million, $7.7 million and $3.1 million of related accelerated amortization expense in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with our revenue recognition, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, capitalization and useful lives associated with our intangible assets, discontinued operations, income taxes, stock-based compensation and the recoverability of our long-lived assets including our media content portfolio, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $5.1 million total from the sales of our Pluck business and certain niche media properties, $5.1 million from the early repayment of a promissory note to us, $1.0 million received from a disposition holdback and $0.7 million from restricted deposits. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to investments of $4.7 million in property and equipment, primarily comprised of investments in servers and IT equipment, fixtures and fittings, leasehold improvements and internally developed software, and investments of $0.1 million in intangible assets, primarily comprised of media content.\nOur Content & Media service offering is affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and our Marketplaces service offering is affected by traditional retail seasonality as well as seasonal fluctuations in internet usage. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months while our marketplaces generally experience increased sales activity during the fourth quarter holiday season. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results.\nStock-based Compensation\nContent & Media Metrics\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $89.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily comprised of net borrowings of $96.3 million under our previous credit facility, partially offset by debt issuance costs of $1.9 million incurred related to the credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received proceeds of $4.7 million from the exercise of employee stock options and contributions from participants in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and we incurred $4.6 million of costs related to net taxes paid on employee stock options exercises and restricted stock units vesting. In addition, we repurchased 0.6 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase plan at a cost of $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nService costs consist of payments relating to our Internet connection and co-location charges and other platform operating expenses, including depreciation of the systems and hardware used to build and operate our content creation and distribution platform; expenses related to creating, rewriting, or auditing certain content units; and personnel costs related to in-house editorial, customer service and information technology. Service costs also include payments to our customers pursuant to revenue-sharing arrangements where we are the primary obligor. In the near term, we expect service costs to decrease as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of lower personnel and information technology expenses.\n \u00b7 Number of transactions: We define transactions as the total number of successfully completed transactions during the applicable period. \nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $16.2 million, or 45%, to $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was driven by a $13.1 million decrease in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, primarily due to our shift away from direct advertising sales, a $2.6 million reduction in marketing and branding activities, and a $0.5 million decrease in software licensing fees.\nProduct costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $16.2 million, or 164%, to $26.1 million compared to product costs of $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased costs related to the higher volume of products sold on Society6. The year ended December 31, 2014 represented our first full year of product costs related to Society6, which was acquired in June 2013.\nNet other income for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $0.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a $0.8 million gain on sale from dispositions during the 2014 period.\nProduct development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred in our software engineering, product development and web design activities and related personnel costs. Fluctuations in our product development expenses are generally the result of hiring personnel to support and develop our platforms, including the costs to improve our owned and operated online properties and related mobile applications, as well as the costs to develop future product and service offerings. We currently anticipate that our product development expenses will remain relatively flat in the near term as a percentage of revenue.\nThrough our Marketplaces service offering, we operate two leading art and design marketplaces where large communities of artists can market and sell their original artwork or their original designs printed on a wide variety of products. Society6 provides artists with an online commerce platform to feature and sell their original designs on a wide variety of consumer and home d\u00e9cor products such as art prints, phone and tablet cases, t-shirts and throw pillows. Saatchi Art is an online art gallery featuring a wide selection of original paintings, drawings, sculptures and photography that provides a global community of artists a curated environment in which to exhibit and sell their work directly to customers around the world.\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $19.6 million, or 51%, to $18.7 million compared to $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the removal of certain content units from our media properties in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the disposition of certain intangible assets in connection with the sales of our Pluck business in the first quarter of 2015 and our Creativebug and CoveritLive businesses in the third quarter of 2014, offset by an increase in amortization expense from intangible assets acquired from the Saatchi Art acquisition in the third quarter of 2014.\nYear ended December 31, 2015\nOur Content & Media service offering includes our leading owned and operated online properties that publish media content, including text articles, videos, photographs and designed visual formats. This content is published across several key categories on eHow, a do-it-yourself and how-to reference destination; Livestrong.com, a health and healthy living destination; Cracked, a humor site offering original and engaging comedy-driven video series, text articles and blogs; and certain other niche properties focused on specific interests. Additionally, our studioD business develops and executes content marketing strategies and creates custom content for third-party brands, advertisers and publishers.\nThe Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in determining the fair value of our awards. The most significant assumptions and judgments include the expected volatility, expected term of the award and estimated forfeiture rates.\nSales and Marketing\nProduct Development\n\nDecember 31, 2014 and 2013. We reclassified the following activity in our consolidated statements of operations from continuing operations to discontinued operations (in thousands):\nContent & Media revenue decreased by $58.0 million, or 30%, to $137.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $195.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Visits decreased by 1% to 4,004 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2014 from 4,032 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to declines in desktop visits from eHow, Cracked and Livestrong.com, largely offset by mobile visit growth across most of our media properties and desktop visit growth from our international websites and customer web pages hosted by our content channel services. RPV decreased by 29%, to $34.22 in the year ended December 31, 2014 from $48.39 in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to lower ad monetization yields from cost-per-click advertising, a reduction in higher yielding direct sold display advertising, and a mix shift to lower ad monetizing visits from mobile and international users.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform step one of a two-step goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit. We are required to perform step one only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying value of its assets. Should this be the case, the first step of the two-step process is to identify whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective carrying values, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nWe test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year unless there are interim indicators that suggest that it is more likely than not that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and as of December 31, 2015 we determined that we have two reporting units: content and media and marketplaces. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2015. We may be required to record impairment charges on our remaining goodwill in future periods. For the year ended December 31, 2014, due to unexpected revenue declines attributed to lower traffic and monetization yields on certain of our content and media websites, we lowered our future cash flow expectations. As a result, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of the goodwill in our content and media reporting unit in the third quarter of 2014 and recorded a $232.3 million goodwill impairment charge in 2014.\nService costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by approximately $6.0 million, or 14%, to $37.3 million compared to $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in service costs was primarily due to decreases of $2.1 million in information technology expense, $2.0 million in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, $0.9 million in traffic acquisition costs, $0.8 million in depreciation expense, $0.6 million in ad serving costs, $0.6 million related to newly created content and content renovation, and $0.6 million in consulting expense. The decrease in information technology expense was primarily related to the disposition of our Pluck business and a reduction in colocation, bandwidth and other support costs. These factors were partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in cost of services related to Saatchi Art.\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash balances and short-term investments. We typically invest our available cash balances in money market funds and short-term United States Treasury obligations. Interest expense principally consisted of interest on outstanding debt and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our credit facility, which was fully repaid in November 2014.\n\nService costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by approximately $7.9 million, or 16%, to $43.3 million compared to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in service costs was primarily due to decreases of $2.8 million in depreciation expense, $2.4 million in ad serving costs, $1.8 million in traffic acquisition costs, $1.7 million related to newly created content, $1.0 million in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and $0.1 million in information technology expense. These factors were partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in content remediation related expenses.\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing personnel costs, sales support, public relations, advertising, marketing and general promotional expenditures. Fluctuations in our sales and marketing expenses are generally the result of our efforts to drive growth in our product and service offerings. We currently anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the near term as a percentage of revenue as we grow our marketing activities across all our platforms, especially our studioD and Marketplaces offerings.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe generate Content & Media service revenue primarily from advertisements displayed on our online properties and on certain webpages of our content channel customers' online properties that are hosted by our content services. Articles, videos and other forms of content generate advertising revenue from a diverse mix of advertising methods including performance-based cost-per-click advertising, in which an advertiser pays only when a visitor clicks on an advertisement; display advertisements, where revenue is dependent upon the number of advertising impressions delivered; native advertisements, which are advertisements created to match the form and function of the platform on which they appear; sponsored content; or advertising links. At times we enter into revenue-sharing arrangements with our customers, and if we are considered the primary obligor, we report the underlying revenue on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations and record the revenue-sharing payments to our customers in service costs.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nWe currently believe that based on the available information, it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized, and accordingly we have taken a full valuation allowance against all of our United States federal and certain state and foreign deferred tax assets. Federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an ownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. Currently, we do not expect the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the near term to be materially affected as no significant limitations are expected to be placed on these carry-forwards as a result of our previous ownership changes.\nCapital Expenditures\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $125.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily comprised of $96.3 million used to repay all amounts outstanding under our previous credit facility and $24.1 million used to capitalize Rightside in connection with the Separation. We also used $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to fund acquisition holdbacks related to our acquisitions of Name.com, Creativebug and Society6. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we also incurred $2.9 million of costs related to net taxes paid on employee stock options exercises and restricted stock units vesting and we received proceeds of $0.5 million from the exercise of employee stock options and contributions from participants in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nOn August 1, 2014, we completed the separation of Rightside Group, Ltd. ( Rightside\u201d) from Demand Media, Inc., resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies (hereinafter referred to as the Separation\u201d). Following the Separation, Rightside operates our former domain name services business, while we continue to own and operate our Content & Media and Marketplaces businesses. The Separation was structured as a pro rata tax-free dividend involving the distribution of all outstanding shares of Rightside common stock to holders of Demand Media common stock as of the August 1, 2014 record date (the Distribution\u201d). Immediately following the Distribution, we completed a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of our outstanding and treasury shares of common stock. The financial results of Rightside are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods prior to fiscal 2015 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless it is disclosed, all financial results represent continuing operations.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when events or circumstances change in a manner that indicates goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, a decline in our stock price leading to an extended period when our market capitalization is less than the book value of our net assets, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\n\nStock-based Compensation\nNet cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was $8.4 million, a decrease of $43.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our net loss during the period was $43.5 million, which included non-cash charges of $37.4 million related to depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, partially offset by gains on disposals of $3.2 million. Cash flow from operating activities was also impacted by a decrease in our working capital, including changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and deferred revenue of $5.0 million, offset in part by changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other long-term assets of $4.1 million. The decrease in our deferred revenue was primarily due to the sale of our Pluck social media business and the sale of other non-core niche media properties during the period. The changes in our accounts receivable and accounts payable were primarily due to the timing of payments and collections.\nIntangible Assets-Media Content\nNet cash used in investing activities was $114.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, and included $73.6 million of cash paid as partial consideration to acquire Society6 and Creativebug, investments of $16.8 million in intangible assets, primarily comprised of media content, and investments of $26.7 million in property and equipment, primarily comprised of servers and IT equipment, fixtures and fittings, leasehold improvements and internally developed software. In connection with our former domain name business, we made net payments for gTLD applications of $3.9 million and received cash proceeds of $5.6 million from the withdrawals of our interest in certain gTLD applications during the year ended December 31, 2013.\n\nWe recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; performance of services has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. We consider persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement to be the receipt of a signed contract. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including transaction history and the credit worthiness of a customer. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. We record cash received in advance of revenue recognition as deferred revenue.\nThe revenue generated by our Marketplaces service offering has higher costs associated with it as compared to our Content & Media service offering due to variable product costs, including outsourced product manufacturing costs, artist royalties, marketing costs, and shipping and handling costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, a higher percentage of our total revenue was generated by our Marketplaces service offering as compared to the prior year. If our revenue sources continue to shift from our Content & Media service offering to our Marketplaces service offering, our total costs relative to our revenue will be negatively impacted.\nNet other income for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $2.4 million to $3.1 million compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the gain on sale of our Pluck business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we reported revenue of $126.0 million, $172.4 million and $209.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Content & Media revenue accounted for 59%, 79% and 93% of our total revenue, respectively, and our Marketplaces revenue accounted for 41%, 21% and 7% of our total revenue, respectively.\nNet interest expense was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $2.8 million from $1.6 million in the same period in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increased balance outstanding under our previous credit facility and a $1.7 million write-off of debt issuance costs associated with terminating our credit facility in November 2014.\n \u00b7 Revenue per visit ( RPV\u201d): We define RPV as Content & Media revenue per one thousand visits. \nService Costs\nSince our inception, we have used significant cash to make strategic acquisitions to grow our business, including the acquisitions of Society6 in June 2013 and Saatchi Art in August 2014. A portion of the purchase price for Society6 was held back by us to secure any post-closing indemnification obligations and/or post-closing adjustments to the purchase price, and in July 2015, we paid $7.4 million in cash and issued an additional 122,638 shares of our common stock to the sellers of Society6 following the expiration of the indemnification holdback period. We have also generated cash since July 2014 by disposing of certain businesses. In July 2014, we sold our Creativebug business for $10.0 million in cash, $1.0 million of which was initially held in escrow and released to us in July 2015. In July 2014, we also sold our CoveritLive social media business for $4.5 million in cash and a promissory note with a principal amount of $5.6 million, originally due in full by July 2016. In September 2015, we agreed to an early repayment of the promissory note and received $5.1 million in cash, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which satisfied all amounts owed to us under the promissory note. In addition, in February 2015 we sold our Pluck social media business for $3.8 million in cash after working capital adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we also sold certain non-core niche online properties for a total of $1.2 million. We may make further acquisitions and dispositions in the future.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nMarketplaces revenue increased by $21.1 million, or 147%, to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The number of transactions increased 158% to 715,343 in the year ended December 31, 2014 from 277,442 in the prior year period, driven primarily by a full year of results for Society6, which we acquired in June 2013. Average revenue per transaction was $49.47 for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreasing by 4% as compared to $51.65 in the prior year period due to a mix shift that includes lower priced product offerings on Society6.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2014 was $34.7 million, a decrease of $41.5 million compared to the prior year. Our net loss during the period was $267.4 million, which included non-cash charges of $232.3 million for goodwill impairment and $82.9 million related to depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and debt extinguishment, partially offset by deferred taxes, gain on disposals of businesses and properties, gain on other assets, net and other totaling $22.6 million. Cash flow from operating activities was also impacted by a decrease in our working capital, including changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue of $22.8 million, offset in part by changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred registration costs, other long-term assets and deposits with registries of $13.3 million. The increase in our deferred revenue was primarily due to growth in our former registrar service during the period. The decrease in accrued expenses is reflective of increases in amounts due to certain vendors and our employees resulting from growth in our business, while the changes in our accounts receivable and accounts payable were primarily due to the timing of payments and collections.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $0.3 million, or 1%, to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in expense was driven by a $2.4 million increase in marketing expenses from Society6 and studioD, partially offset by decreases in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, of $1.7 million and consulting expenses of $0.4 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily comprised of $7.6 million of cash paid for acquisition holdbacks from prior year acquisitions and $0.7 million of costs related to net taxes paid on exercises of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock units. We received proceeds of $0.5 million from the exercise of employee stock options and contributions from participants in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOur revenue is primarily derived from sales of advertising and from products and services sold through our online marketplaces.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe report the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations if the disposal of a component represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results. The results of discontinued operations are reported in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for current and prior periods commencing in the period in which the business meets the criteria of a discontinued operation, and include any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.\nProduct development expenses decreased by $2.8 million, or 9%, to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was driven by a $2.5 million reduction in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as a $0.3 million decrease in consulting expense.\nProduct costs consist of outsourced product manufacturing costs, artist royalties, and personnel costs. In the near term, we expect our product costs to remain relatively flat as a percentage of product revenue.\nvalue, then a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The amount of the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its implied fair value. The estimate of implied fair value of goodwill is primarily based on an estimate of the discounted cash flows expected to result from that reporting unit, but may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as our software, technology, patents and trademarks.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and included investments of $8.9 million in property and equipment, primarily comprised of servers and IT equipment, fixtures and fittings, leasehold improvements and internally developed software, and investments of $5.7 million in intangible assets, primarily composed of media content. Cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 also included cash inflows of $13.7 million from the sales of businesses, including Creativebug and CoveritLive, as well as outflows of $2.2 million as partial consideration to acquire Saatchi Art, and $3.1 million of restricted cash comprised of a $1.7 million holdback amount paid by us as part of the Saatchi Art consideration and $1.4 million for a standby letter of credit we cash collateralized in connection with the payment arrangement for our Santa Monica office lease. In connection with our former domain name business, we made net payments for gTLD applications of $15.8 million and received cash proceeds of $6.1 million from the withdrawals of our interest in certain gTLD applications during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe capitalize certain costs (i) allocated to the purchase price of certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations and (ii) incurred to develop media content that is determined to have a probable economic benefit. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the related expected useful lives of these assets. We determine the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on our historical experience of intangible assets of similar quality and value. In the event of content remediation in future periods, additional accelerated amortization expense may be incurred in the periods such actions occur. We expect amortization expense related to business combinations to decrease in the near term due to fewer acquisitions as compared to prior years. Amortization as a percentage of revenue will depend upon a variety of factors, such as the amounts and mix of our investments in content and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived tangible and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Such trigger events or changes in circumstances may include: a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, including those resulting from technology advancements in the industry, the impact of competition or other factors that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse deterioration in the amount of revenue or cash flows we expect to generate from an asset group, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of a long-lived asset, current or future operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset, or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. We perform impairment testing at the asset group level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. Fair value is determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows. Assets to be disposed of, if any, are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated or amortized.\nRevenue\nOur Marketplaces service offering generates revenue from the sale of products and services through our art and design marketplaces. On Society6, revenue is generated from the sale of print-on-demand products. Saatchi Art primarily generates revenue through commissions on the final sale price of original works of art. Our Marketplaces service offering is principally dependent on the number of transactions and average revenue per transaction generated by products and services sold through our online marketplaces. We believe there are opportunities to increase the number of transactions and the average revenue per transaction by attracting new visitors to our marketplaces via diverse online and offline marketing, improving conversion of visitors to purchasing customers, continuing to introduce new products, and offering product bundling and other promotions.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax (benefit) provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Our evaluations of uncertain tax positions are based upon their technical merits, and relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nRecoverability of Long-lived Assets\nWe estimated the expected volatility of our awards from the historical volatility of selected public companies within the Internet and media industry with comparable characteristics to Demand Media, including similarity in size, lines of business, market capitalization, revenue and financial leverage. We calculated the weighted average expected life of our options based upon our historical experience of option exercises combined with estimates of the post-vesting holding period. The-risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with terms approximately equal to the expected life of the option. The expected dividend rate is zero as we currently have no history or expectation of paying cash dividends on our common stock. The forfeiture rate is established based on applicable historical forfeiture patterns adjusted for any expected changes in future periods.\nProduct Costs\nYear ended December 31, 2013\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2015\nOverview\nWe believe that there are opportunities to increase the number of visits to our online properties, both from direct visits by users and search engine referrals, by building high-quality products that provide a better user experience and lead to increased engagement. Since 2013, we have focused our efforts on redesigning our websites; refining our content library; rationalizing ad unit density; and developing a greater variety of content formats, particularly formats better suited for mobile devices. We have also recently started a new initiative to work with a network of contributors and influencers to create more authoritative and engaging content. These changes could negatively impact revenue and increase our operating expenses in the near term, but we believe that by providing consumers with an improved user and content experience, we will be able to increase the number of visits and revenue in a sustained fashion over the long-term. We also believe there are opportunities to increase our advertising revenue by optimizing our ad product stack and increasing branded ad sales through direct sellers and by offering more innovative products such as native advertisements and sponsored ad placements. However, if the overall ad unit rates we receive continue to decline, we could experience lower advertising revenue even if the number of visits to our properties increases.\nProduct development expenses decreased by $5.1 million, or 17%, to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was driven by a $4.8 million reduction in personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and a $0.3 million decrease in depreciation expense.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nIn the normal course of business, we have provided certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities include intellectual property indemnities to our customers, indemnities to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of Delaware, indemnifications related to our lease agreements and indemnifications to sellers or buyers in connection with acquisitions and dispositions, respectively. In addition, our advertiser, content creation and distribution partner agreements contain certain indemnification provisions, which are generally consistent with those prevalent in our industry. We have not incurred significant obligations under indemnification provisions historically, and do not expect to incur significant obligations in the future. Accordingly, we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $2.8 million, or 5%, to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $2.3 million in facilities and related costs, $1.2 million in personnel and related costs, including stock-\nIncome Taxes\nProduct Development\nRevenue\nYear ended December 31, 2014\nGeneral and Administrative\n\n\nYear ended December 31, 2013\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of the year, consistent with our existing accounting policy, and we determined that there was no impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there was $10.4 million of goodwill recorded in our marketplaces reporting unit. We may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\nDiscontinued Operations\nSales and Marketing\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we allocate revenue to each deliverable if the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The fair value of the selling price for a deliverable is determined using a hierarchy of (1) Company-specific objective and reliable evidence, then (2) third-party evidence, then (3) best estimate of selling price. We allocate any arrangement fee to each of the elements based on their relative selling prices.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nRevenue\nHistorically, the majority of our advertising revenue has been generated by our relationship with Google. While Google continues to be our primary ad vendor for ad monetization, in 2015 we began to significantly diversify our monetization partners and will continue to do so going forward. Google also serves as one of our primary technology\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax expense of $0.1 million compared to an income tax benefit of $14.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The change was primarily due to the tax effect arising from the impairment of goodwill and its impact on our valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2014. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily related to minimal state and foreign income tax expenses.\nSelected Quarterly Financial Data\nKey Business Metrics\n (1) For a description of the method used to compute our basic and diluted net income (loss) per share, refer to note 7 in Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data.\u201d \nContractual Obligations\nYear ended December 31, 2015\nSee Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part III, Item 15, Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeverance Costs\nIntangible Assets-Acquired in Business Combinations\nGoodwill\n \u00b7 Average revenue per transaction: We calculate average revenue per transaction by dividing Marketplaces revenue for a period by the number of transactions in that period. \nMarketplaces Revenue\nOur Content & Media service offering derives the majority of its revenue from the sale of advertising on our online properties. Our advertising revenue is principally dependent on the number of visits to our properties and the corresponding ad unit rates. Since 2011, the total number of visits to our properties, particularly eHow, has substantially declined due to lower search engine referrals resulting from ongoing changes to search engine algorithms by Google, Yahoo! and Bing, as well as our decision to remove low quality and duplicative content. We have also experienced lower ad monetization due to industry declines in cost-per-click ad rates and our decision to reduce the number of ads per page on certain articles. In addition, visits across our online properties continue to shift from desktop to mobile, with ad unit rates for mobile generally lower than desktop. Future changes to search engine algorithms that negatively impact the volume of referral traffic, declines in ad unit rates, or increased availability of ad blocking software, particularly on mobile devices, could result in a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, due to unexpected revenue declines attributable to lower traffic and monetization yield on certain of our content and media websites, we lowered our future cash flow expectations. As a result of the decline in our cash flow forecast as well as a sustained decline in our market capitalization which remained at a level below the book value of our net assets for an extended period of time, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of the goodwill in our content and media reporting unit in the third quarter of 2014. Based on our analyses, we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of goodwill for the content and media reporting unit and that the implied fair value of the goodwill in the content and media reporting unit was zero. Accordingly, we recorded a $232.3 million goodwill impairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nContent & Media Revenue\nShipping and Handling\nBasis of Presentation\nSince our inception, we have been subject to income taxes principally in the United States, and certain other countries where we have or had a legal presence, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada and Argentina. We may in the future become subject to taxation in additional countries based on the foreign statutory rates and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.\nProduct Revenue\nThe following table sets forth our key business metrics for the periods presented:\nYear ended December 31, 2013\nSeparation\nIndemnifications\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we used $4.7 million, $8.9 million and $26.7 million, respectively, in cash to fund capital expenditures to create internally developed software, fund leasehold improvements and purchase servers, IT equipment and fixtures and fittings. We currently anticipate making capital expenditures between $4.0 million and $8.0 million during the year ending December 31, 2016.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nProduct Costs\nIncluded in operating expenses are expenses associated with stock-based compensation, which are allocated and included in service costs, sales and marketing, product development and general and administrative expenses. Stock-based compensation expense is largely comprised of costs associated with stock options, restricted stock units and\nYear ended December 31, 2014\nProduct costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $7.7 million, or 30%, to $33.8 million compared to product costs of $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased costs related to the higher volume of products sold on Society6.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n\nWe performed our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2015, and based on the results of the annual impairment test there was no goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nYear ended December 31, 2014\nplatform partners in connection with our programmatic ad sales offering. Any change in the type of services that Google provides to us, or to the terms of our agreements with Google, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nContent & Media\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an income tax benefit of $14.7 million compared to an income tax expense of $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, representing a $17.6 million decrease. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of tax amortization of goodwill from the impairment of goodwill and its impact on our valuation allowance.\nService Costs\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees, non-employees and directors based on the grant date fair values of the awards. For stock option awards to employees with service based vesting conditions, the fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The value of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations. We elected to treat stock-based payment awards with graded vesting schedules and time-based service conditions as a single award and recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expenses are classified in the consolidated statement of operations based on the department to which the related employee reports. Our stock-based awards are comprised principally of stock options, restricted stock units and, in the past, restricted stock awards.\nGoodwill Impairment Charge\nContent & Media\nCosts and Expenses\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of transaction gains and losses on foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and gains or losses on sales of businesses. We expect that these gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in underlying currency exchange rates and whether we dispose of any businesses.\nOur cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash-based investments in operations, including working capital, and corporate infrastructure to support our ability to generate revenue and conduct operations. Cash used in investing activities has historically been, and is expected to be, impacted by our ongoing investments in our platforms, company infrastructure and equipment. The following table sets forth our major sources and (uses) of cash for each period as set forth below (in thousands):\nMarketplaces revenue increased by $16.8 million, or 47%, to $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The number of transactions increased 29% to 925,111 in the year ended December 31, 2015 from 715,343 in the prior year period, driven primarily by new product introductions, increased conversion of visits to purchases, and traffic growth on Society6. Average revenue per transaction was $56.38 for the year ended December 31, 2015, increasing by 14% as compared to $49.47 in the prior year period due primarily to a shift towards higher priced items on Society6, as well as the addition of Saatchi Art in August 2014, which has significantly higher average revenue per transaction.\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables from our customers based on our best estimate of the amount of probable losses from existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on an analysis of historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. In addition, past due balances over 60 days and specific other balances are reviewed individually for collectability on at least a quarterly basis. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense were not significant and we expect that this trend will continue in the near term.\n\nNet interest income was approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to interest income paid to us on the promissory note we received as part of the consideration for our sale of CoveritLive in July 2014.\nMarketplaces\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to our respective net tangible and intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets include: trade names, non-compete agreements, owned website names, artist\nCapitalized media content is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life, which is typically five years, representing our estimate of when the underlying economic benefits are expected to be realized and based on our estimates of the projected cash flows from advertising revenue expected to be generated by the deployment of such content. These estimates are based on our plans and projections, comparison of the economic returns generated by our content with content of comparable quality and an analysis of historical cash flows generated by that content to date.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs from our executive, legal, finance, human resources and information technology organizations and facilities related expenditures, as well as third-party professional fees and insurance. Professional fees are largely comprised of outside legal, audit and information technology consulting. We currently anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease in the near term as a percentage of revenue due to managed reduction of expenses.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nMarketplaces\nAs a percentage of revenue:\n (2) During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we identified through our internal processes that our property and equipment, net was overstated because certain capitalized internally developed software costs had not been placed into service and certain write-offs were not identified on a timely basis. As such, during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we recorded an out of period adjustment which increased depreciation by $0.6 million and decreased Other income, net\u201d by $0.5 million. \nSeasonality of Quarterly Results\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, we implemented a number of initiatives to improve operating efficiency, including targeted reductions in force in areas where our business model shifted during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $2.2 million in severance costs primarily related to certain workforce reduction actions that occurred during the year. These severance costs were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 as follows: $1.1 million in product development costs, $0.6 million in service costs, $0.4 million in general and administrative costs, and $0.1 million in sales and marketing costs. Severance costs include severance pay, the provision of certain extended employee benefits, and employer taxes. As of December 31, 2015, there was $0.5 million of accrued severance costs included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We will incur additional severance costs currently estimated to be $0.2 million over the applicable retention periods, which extend through the first quarter of 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nMarketplaces Metrics\n (1) For a discussion of these period-to-period changes in the number of visits, RPV, number of transactions and average revenue per transaction and how they impacted our financial results, see Results of Operations\u201d below. \nrestricted stock granted to employees, directors and non-employees, and expenses relating to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We record the fair value of these equity-based awards and expenses at their cost ratably over related vesting periods.\nWe are a diversified Internet company that builds platforms across its media and marketplaces properties to enable communities of creators to reach passionate audiences in large and growing lifestyle categories. Our business is comprised of two service offerings: Content & Media and Marketplaces.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2013 was $76.2 million, a decrease of $14.8 million compared to the prior year. Our net loss during the period was $20.2 million, which included non-cash charges of $96.2 million related to depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and deferred taxes, partially offset by gain on other assets, net and other of $5.1 million. Cash flow from operating activities was also impacted by an increase in our working capital, including changes in accounts receivable, deferred revenue and accounts payable of $24.8 million, offset in part by changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets, accrued expenses, other long-term assets, deferred registration costs, and deposits with registries of $19.6 million. The increases in our deferred revenue and deferred registration costs were primarily due to growth in our former registrar business during the period, while the decrease in our accounts receivable balances was primarily due to timing of collections.\nOn August 1, 2014, we completed the Separation of Rightside from Demand Media, resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies. Following the Separation, Rightside operates our former domain name services business, while we continue to own and operate our Content & Media and Marketplaces businesses. The financial results of Rightside are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended\nRevenue by service offering was as follows (in thousands):\nrelationships, customer relationships, technology, media content, and content publisher relationships. We use valuation techniques to value these intangibles assets, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions and estimates including projected revenue, operating costs, growth rates, useful lives and discount rates. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed.\n\nWe recognize product revenue from sales of Society6 products upon delivery, net of estimated returns based on historical experience. Product revenue for Society6 is recognized net of sales allowances and return allowances. We recognize product revenue from the sale of prints through Saatchi Art when the prints are delivered and the return period has expired. Payments received in advance of delivery and, with respect to the Saatchi Art prints, prior to completion of the return period are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Product revenue is recorded at the gross amount due to the following factors: we are the primary obligor in a transaction, we have inventory and credit risk, and we have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers. We periodically provide incentive offers to customers to encourage purchases, including percentage discounts off current purchases, free shipping and other offers. VAT, sales tax and other taxes are not included in product revenue because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting any such taxes.\nGeneral and Administrative\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nWe also generate Content & Media service revenue from the sale or license of media content, including the creation and distribution of content for third-party brands, advertisers and publishers through our studioD business. Revenue from the sale or perpetual license of media content is recognized when the content has been delivered and the contractual performance obligations have been fulfilled. Revenue from the non-perpetual license of media content is recognized over the period of the license as content is delivered or when other related performance criteria are fulfilled. In circumstances where we distribute our content on third-party properties and the customer acts as the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis. In addition, we previously provided social media services and generated Content & Media service revenue from recurring management support fees, overage fees in excess of standard usage terms, outside consulting fees and initial set-up fees. As of February 2015, we no longer provide social media services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, due to unexpected revenue declines attributable to lower traffic and monetization yield on certain of our content and media websites, we lowered our future cash flow expectations. As a result of the decline in our cash flow forecast as well as a sustained decline in our market capitalization which remained at a level below the book value of our net assets for an extended period of time, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of the goodwill in our content and media reporting unit in the third quarter of 2014. Based on our analyses, we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of goodwill for the content and media reporting unit and as a result, we determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill in the content and media reporting unit was zero. Accordingly, we recorded $232.3 million for the goodwill impairment charge in 2014.\nRevenue Recognition\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $1.8 million, or 5%, to $38.3 million compared to $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to additional amortization expense from intangible assets acquired from the Society6 acquisition in 2013, as well as an increase in accelerated amortization expense due to our content remediation efforts initiated in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by lower amortization expense of media content due to our removal of certain content units in the fourth quarter of 2013, and reduced amortization due to the disposition of certain intangible assets in connection with certain business disposals.\nIncluded in operating lease obligations are agreements to lease our primary office space in Santa Monica, California and other locations under various operating leases that have non-cancelable periods ending between February 2018 and February 2020.\nWe capitalize the direct costs incurred to acquire our media content that is determined to embody a probable future economic benefit. Costs are recognized as finite-lived intangible assets based on their acquisition cost to us. All costs incurred to deploy and publish content are expensed as incurred, including the costs incurred for the ongoing maintenance of websites on which our content resides. We generally acquire content when our internal systems and processes provide reasonable assurance that, given predicted consumer and advertiser demand relative to our predetermined cost to acquire the content, the content unit will generate revenue over its useful life that exceeds the cost of acquisition. In determining whether content embodies a probable future economic benefit required for asset capitalization, we make judgments and estimates including the forecasted number of visits and the advertising rates that the content will generate. These estimates and judgments take into consideration various inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, total expected visits over the content's useful life; the fact that our content creation and distribution model is evolving and may be impacted by competition and technological advancements; our ability to expand existing and enter into new distribution channels and applications for our content; and whether we will be able to generate similar economic returns from content in the future. Management has reviewed, and intends to regularly review, the operating performance of content in determining probable future economic benefits of our content.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nAt December 31, 2015, we had a cash collateralized standby letter of credit for approximately $1.2 million associated with one of our leases.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $38.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, as well as the cash we generate from our operations. Historically, we have principally financed our operations from the issuance of stock, net cash provided by our operating activities and borrowings under our previous credit facilities. In November 2014, we repaid all outstanding amounts under our previous credit facility and terminated that facility, and we do not currently have an available line of credit. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, in order to fund our operations, make potential acquisitions, pursue new business opportunities and invest in our existing businesses, platforms and technologies, we may need to raise additional funds by entering into a new credit facility, selling certain assets or issuing equity, equity-related or debt securities. Our shelf registration statement previously filed with the SEC expired in October 2015.\nThe following unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations for the quarters in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated annual financial statements, and include, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the financial information contained in those statements. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated annual financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill\nContent & Media revenue decreased by $63.2 million, or 46%, to $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $137.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Visits decreased by 16% to 3,374 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4,004 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by significant declines in desktop visits across all of our media properties, in part due to management's decision to remove over two million articles on eHow and Livestrong.com. These declines were partially offset by mobile visit growth across most of our media properties. RPV decreased by 36%, to $21.87 in the year ended December 31, 2015 from $34.22 in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower ad monetization yields and a shift to a higher mix of mobile traffic with lower RPV than desktop visits. In addition, the disposition of our Pluck business in the first quarter of 2015 contributed approximately $8.2 million to the decrease in revenue.\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item I, Part 1A, Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u00b7 Visits: We define visits as the total number of times users access our content across (a) one of our owned and operated online properties and/or (b) one of our customers' online properties, to the extent that the visited customer web pages are hosted by our content services. In each case, breaks of access of at least 30 minutes constitute a unique visit. \nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nService Revenue\nWe regularly review a number of business metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure the performance of our business model, identify trends impacting our business, determine resource allocations, formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions. Measures which we believe are the primary indicators of our performance are as follows:\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment. During the second quarter of 2015, we made certain changes to our management structure below our chief operating decision maker and, as a result of these changes, we determined that Society6, which had previously been included in our content and media reporting unit, should be combined with the Saatchi Art reporting unit to create a marketplaces reporting unit. A change in reporting units requires that goodwill be tested for impairment. Therefore, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of goodwill for the Saatchi Art reporting unit during the second quarter of 2015 and determined an impairment did not exist. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that we have two reporting units: content and media and marketplaces.\nWe account for our income taxes using the liability and asset method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or in our tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets, and valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We believe any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these audits will not be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe generate service revenue from commissions we receive from facilitating the sale of original art by artists to customers through Saatchi Art. We recognize service revenue arising from the sale of original art net of amounts paid to the artist because we are not the primary obligor in the transaction, we do not have inventory risk, and we do not establish the prices for the art sold. We also recognize this service revenue net of any sales allowances. Revenue is recognized after the original art has been delivered and the return period has expired. Payments received in advance of delivery and completion of the return period are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We periodically provide incentive offers to customers to encourage purchases, including percentage discounts off current purchases, free shipping and other offers. Value-added taxes ( VAT\u201d), sales tax and other taxes are not included in Marketplaces service revenue because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting any such taxes.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $11.8 million, or 24%, to $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $9.3 million in personnel and related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, $1.4 million in legal and audit fees, $0.5 million in facilities costs, and $0.2 million in taxes and insurance costs.\nbased compensation expense, and $0.4 million in consulting costs, partially offset by an increase of $0.9 million in depreciation expense.",

$126 million, down 27% from 2014. This was due to declines in Content & Media revenue, partially offset by growth in Marketplaces revenue. \n\n- Net loss for 2015 was $43.5 million compared to a net loss of $267.4 million in 2014. The higher 2014 loss was driven by a $232.3 million goodwill impairment charge.\n\n- Operating expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by lower service costs, sales and marketing expenses, product development costs, general and administrative expenses, and amortization of intangibles. This was partially offset by an increase in product costs.\n\n- Cash used in operating activities was $8.4 million in 2015 compared to cash provided of $34.7 million in 2014, primarily due to the net loss in 2015 and changes in working capital. \n\n- Cash provided by investing activities was $7.1 million in 2015 compared to cash used of $14.9 million in 2014, mainly due to proceeds from asset sales and restricted cash deposits in 2015.\n\n- Cash used in financing activities was $7.9 million in 2015 versus $125.4 million in 2014, largely reflecting debt repayments in 2014.\n\nIn summary, the company saw declines in revenue and profitability in 2015 driven by its Content & Media business. It took steps to reduce operating expenses and generate cash through asset sales. The 2014 results were significantly impacted by a large goodwill impairment charge."}
