MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis MD&A is a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and provides additional information on our business, recent developments, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, cash flows, and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and the other sections of this Form 10-K.\nWe have revised the previously reported consolidated financial statements and related metrics for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 for certain errors that were not material in any of the years revised. See Note 17-Immaterial Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements in the Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nFTD Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries may be referred to herein as the Company,\u201d FTD,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d) is a premier floral and gifting company with a vision to be the leading and most trusted floral and gifting company in the world. Our mission is to inspire, support, and delight our customers when expressing life's most important sentiments. We provide floral, specialty foods, gift, and related products and services to consumers, retail florists, and other retail locations and companies in need of floral and gifting solutions. Our business uses the highly recognized FTD\u00ae and Interflora\u00ae brands, both supported by the iconic Mercury Man\u00ae logo. While we operate primarily in the United States ( U.S.\u201d), Canada, the United Kingdom ( U.K.\u201d), and the Republic of Ireland, we have worldwide presence as our Mercury Man logo is displayed in approximately 35,000 floral shops in nearly 150 countries. Our diversified portfolio of brands also includes ProFlowers\u00ae, ProPlants\u00ae, Shari's Berries\u00ae, Personal Creations\u00ae, RedEnvelope\u00ae, Flying Flowers\u00ae, Flowers Direct\u00ae, Ink Cards\u2122, Postagram\u2122, and Gifts.com\u2122. While floral arrangements and plants are our primary offerings, we also market and sell gift items, including gourmet-dipped berries and other specialty foods, personalized gifts, gift baskets, wine and champagne, jewelry, and spa products.\nAcquisition of Provide Commerce\nOn December 31, 2014, we acquired from a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive Corporation ( Liberty\u201d) all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Provide Commerce, Inc. ( Provide Commerce\u201d), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty, for a purchase price consisting of (i) cash consideration of $106.6 million, excluding acquired cash on hand of $38.1 million and a post-closing working capital adjustment of $9.9 million, and (ii) 10.2 million shares of FTD common stock (the Acquisition\u201d). At the closing of the Acquisition, these shares represented approximately 35% of the issued and outstanding shares of FTD common stock. In April 2015, FTD made a payment to Liberty in full satisfaction of the post-closing working capital adjustment. Upon the closing of the Acquisition, Provide Commerce became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FTD.\nReportable Segments\nPrior to the Acquisition, we reported our business operations in three reportable segments: Consumer, Florist, and International. As a result of the Acquisition, which was completed on December 31, 2014, we began reporting our business in four reportable segments: Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International.\nThrough our Consumer segment, we are a leading direct marketer of floral and gift products for consumers, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Our Consumer segment operates primarily through the www.ftd.com website, associated mobile sites, and the 1-800-SEND-FTD telephone number. Through our Provide Commerce segment, we are a leading direct marketer of floral and gift products for consumers, including food gifts, personalized gifts, and other gifting products, primarily in the U.S. Our Provide Commerce segment operates primarily through our www.proflowers.com, www.berries.com, www.personalcreations.com, www.proplants.com, and www.gifts.com websites, associated mobile sites and applications, and various telephone numbers. Through our Florist segment, we are a leading provider of products and services to our floral network members, including services that enable our floral network members to send, receive, and deliver floral orders. Floral network members include traditional retail florists, as well as other non-florist retail locations, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Our Florist segment also provides products and services to other companies in need of floral and gifting solutions. Our International segment consists of Interflora, which operates primarily in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. Interflora is a premier direct marketer of floral and non-floral gift products, including bears, chocolates, wine, and tailored food products for consumers and operates primarily through the www.interflora.co.uk, www.flyingflowers.co.uk, www.flowersdirect.co.uk, and www.interflora.ie websites, associated mobile sites and applications, and various telephone numbers. Interflora also provides products and services to floral network members, funeral directors, independent gift shops, other retailers, and to other companies in need of floral and gifting solutions.\nFor additional information about our reportable segments refer to Note 3- Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nItems Affecting Comparability of Financial Results\nAs a result of the Acquisition, our operating and reportable segments changed to include a fourth segment, Provide Commerce. Accordingly, beginning December 31, 2014, our operating and reportable segments consist of Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International. However, as the Acquisition was completed on December 31, 2014, no results of operations of Provide Commerce were included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. For additional information about our reportable segments refer to MD&A and Note 3- Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nKEY BUSINESS METRICS\nWe review a number of key business metrics to help us monitor our performance and trends affecting our segments and to develop forecasts and budgets. These key metrics include the following:\nSegment operating income. Our chief operating decision maker uses segment operating income to evaluate the performance of our business segments and to make decisions about allocating resources among segments. Segment operating income is operating income excluding depreciation, amortization, litigation and dispute settlement charges and gains, transaction-related costs, restructuring and other exit costs, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Stock-based compensation and general corporate expenses are not allocated to the segments. Segment operating income is prior to intersegment eliminations and excludes other income (expense), net. See Note 3- Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated operating income and consolidated income before income taxes.\nConsumer orders. We monitor the number of consumer orders for floral, gift, and related products during a given period. Consumer orders are individual units delivered during the period that originated in the U.S. and Canada, primarily through the www.ftd.com, www.proflowers.com, www.berries.com, and www.personalcreations.com websites, associated mobile sites and applications, the 1-800-SEND-FTD telephone number and various other telephone numbers; and in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland, primarily through the www.interflora.co.uk, www.flyingflowers.co.uk, and www.interflora.ie websites, associated mobile sites and applications, and various telephone numbers. The number of consumer orders is not adjusted for non-delivered orders that are refunded on or after the scheduled delivery date. Orders originating with a florist or other retail location for delivery to consumers are not included as part of this number.\nAverage order value. We monitor the average value for consumer orders delivered in a given period, which we refer to as the average order value. Average order value represents the average amount received for consumer orders delivered during a period. The average order value of consumer orders within our Consumer, Provide Commerce, and International segments is tracked in their local currency, the U.S. Dollar ( USD\u201d) for both the Consumer and Provide Commerce segments and the British Pound ( GBP\u201d) for the International segment. The local currency amounts received for the International segment are then translated into USD at the average currency exchange rate for the period. Average order value includes merchandise revenues and shipping or service fees paid by the consumer less discounts and refunds (net of refund-related fees charged to floral network members).\nAverage revenues per member. We monitor average revenues per member for our floral network members in the Florist segment. Average revenues per member represents the average revenues earned from a member of our floral network during a period. Revenues include services revenues and products revenues but exclude revenues from sales to non-members. Floral network members include our retail florists and other non-florist retail locations who offer floral and gifting solutions. Average revenues per member is calculated by dividing Florist segment revenues for the period, excluding sales to non-members, by the average number of floral network members for the period.\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, our consolidated revenues, segment revenues, segment operating income, consumer orders, average order values, average revenues per member, and average currency exchange rates. Since the acquisition of Provide Commerce was completed on December 31, 2014, no results of operations were included for this segment for the year ended December 31 2014.

Constant currency information compares results between periods as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. Our International segment operates principally in the U.K. We calculate constant currency by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period. In addition, we have excluded intersegment revenues and expenses in the discussion below.\nConsolidated Revenues\nConsolidated revenues decreased $96.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenues was primarily due to a decrease of $53.6 million in revenues from our Provide Commerce segment, a $30.1 million decrease in revenues from our Consumer segment, and a $14.2 million decrease in revenues from our International segment (increase of $4.5 million in constant currency). Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenues by $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nConsolidated Cost of Revenues\nConsolidated cost of revenues decreased $63.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated cost of revenues was primarily due a decrease of $33.4 million in costs associated with our Provide Commerce segment, a decrease of $17.4 million in costs associated with our Consumer segment, and a decrease of $10.1 million (increase of $2.8 million in constant currency) in costs associated with our International segment. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $12.8 million favorable impact on cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consolidated cost of revenues, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, remained constant at 63% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nConsolidated Sales and Marketing\nConsolidated sales and marketing expenses decreased $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a decrease of $12.5 million in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Provide Commerce segment, a decrease of $4.5 million related to our Consumer segment, and a decrease of $3.1 million (decrease of $0.9 million in constant currency) associated with our International segment. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $2.2 million favorable impact on sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was 20% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nConsolidated General and Administrative\nConsolidated general and administrative expenses decreased $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs of $6.5 million, which included a decrease in headcount, incentive compensation expense, and stock-based compensation. In addition, transaction-related costs also decreased $2.9 million, facility costs decreased $1.0 million, and technology costs decreased $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Legal costs, including litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries), also decreased $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These decreases were partially offset by increases in bad debt expense of $1.8 million and depreciation expense of $0.6 million. Consolidated general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was stable at 10% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $11.8 million, primarily related to senior management changes, including expenses for severance and related accelerated vesting of equity awards. In addition, we incurred restructuring charges related to the consolidation of certain office and distribution facilities for the Provide Commerce segment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $6.1 million, primarily related to the closure of the Provide Commerce developing businesses and certain distribution and call center locations.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $84.0 million related to the Provide Commerce segment compared to a goodwill impairment charge of $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense was consistent for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The savings related to the lower level of debt principal balances were offset by slightly higher interest rates and amortization of the interest rate cap.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a tax benefit of $5.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $88.3 million, compared to a tax benefit of $1.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the impairment of goodwill is not tax deductible, and therefore, there is no tax benefit recorded on the charges. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the effective tax rate increased primarily due to the higher pre-tax loss and lower non-deductible expenses.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated Revenues\nConsolidated revenues increased $579.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily due to $583.3 million of revenues associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment, a $3.1 million increase in revenues from our Consumer segment, and a $3.2 million increase in revenues from our Florist segment, partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease ($3.5 million increase in constant currency) in revenues from our International segment. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenues by $13.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nConsolidated Cost of Revenues\nConsolidated cost of revenues increased $363.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated cost of revenues was primarily due to $368.4 million of costs associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment and a $0.2 million increase in costs associated with our Florist segment, offset by a $7.7 million decrease (increase $1.3 in constant currency) in costs associated with our International segment and a $2.1 million decrease in costs associated with our Consumer segment. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $9.0 million favorable impact on cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, depreciation expense increased $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Consolidated cost of revenues, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, remained consistent at 63% for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nConsolidated Sales and Marketing\nConsolidated sales and marketing expenses increased $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $136.0 million of sales and marketing expenses associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment and an increase of $3.0 million in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Florist segment. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $1.5 million (increase $0.1 million in constant currency) and $0.4 million in sales and marketing expenses associated with our International and Consumer segments, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $1.6 million favorable impact on sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 17% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nConsolidated General and Administrative\nConsolidated general and administrative expenses increased $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $37.2 million of general and administrative expenses associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment, excluding depreciation and transaction-related costs. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2015, depreciation expense increased $9.3 million primarily due to assets acquired in the Acquisition. Further, personnel-related costs, excluding those directly related to the Provide Commerce segment, increased $7.9 million, primarily due to increased stock-based compensation. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in transaction-related costs of $5.7 million due to a majority of the transaction costs related to the Acquisition being recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries) were $3.1 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2015, than the year ended December 31, 2014. Consolidated general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was 10% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 12% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the intangible assets acquired in the Acquisition.\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $6.1 million, primarily related to the closure of the Provide Commerce developing businesses certain distribution and call center locations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $0.2 million, primarily related to the closure of various U.K. garden center concession stands.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $85.0 million related to the Provide Commerce segment.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense increased $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increases were due to higher debt principal balances outstanding, associated with the incremental borrowing for the Acquisition, as well as higher interest rates and increased amortization of both the interest rate cap and deferred financing fees.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.1 million on pre-tax loss of $81.3 million, compared to a tax provision of $9.5 million on pre-tax income of $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the impairment of goodwill is not tax deductible, and therefore, there is no tax benefit recorded on the charge. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to book losses in the U.S. resulting from the goodwill impairment and the amortization of the intangibles acquired in the Acquisition.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS\nPrior to the Acquisition, the Company reported its business operations in three reportable segments: Consumer, Florist, and International. As a result of the Acquisition, the Company began reporting its business in four reportable segments: Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International. Segment operating income is operating income excluding depreciation, amortization, litigation and dispute settlement charges or gains, transaction-related costs, restructuring and other exit costs, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Stock-based compensation and general corporate expenses are not allocated to the segments. Segment operating income is prior to intersegment eliminations and excludes other income, net.\nThe segment results included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 3-Segment Information to the Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is also presented on this basis.\nCONSUMER SEGMENT Table 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except for percentages and average order values)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>318,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,138\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,594\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key metrics and other\nfinancial data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer orders\n</td> <td>3,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(408\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average order value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating margin\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nConsumer Segment Revenues\nConsumer segment revenues decreased $30.1 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by a 10% decrease in order volume, partially offset by a 1% increase in average order value. In 2016, consumer order volume was negatively impacted by the Sunday timing of the Valentine's Day holiday, which worsened from the Saturday placement of the holiday in 2015. During 2016, we elected to shift certain group buying placements to the Provide Commerce segment and also reduce the number of partners due to changes in some partners' marketing strategies. Both of these changes had an impact on revenues in these programs for 2016. In addition, revenue was lower for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to $4.1 million of breakage revenue which was recognized in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of our determination, based on a change in circumstances, that there was no longer a requirement to remit to relevant jurisdictions, under unclaimed property laws, the value of certain gift cards and vouchers which are not expected to be redeemed ( breakage\u201d). Breakage revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 was not significant.\nConsumer Segment Operating Income\nConsumer segment operating income decreased $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the decrease in revenues of $30.1 million, as previously described, partially offset by a $23.5 million decrease in operating expenses. Operating expenses were lower primarily due to a decrease in cost of revenues of $17.4 million, which was driven by reduced spending associated with lower order volume. Other operating expenses decreased $6.2 million primarily due to reduced spending associated with lower order volume, lower fixed costs in the customer service area, and lower technology and development costs. In addition, segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was lower compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the breakage adjustment. The consumer segment operating margin decreased to 10% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsumer Segment Revenues\nConsumer segment revenues slightly increased $3.1 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The Consumer segment recognized breakage revenue of $4.1 million during the third quarter of 2015 as noted above. Segment revenues improved as average order value increased 2% primarily driven by consumers selecting higher value offerings, our sympathy business, which typically carries higher average order values, and other merchandising improvements. Revenue increases were partially offset by the consumer order volume decrease of 2%, primarily related to declines during the Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and Christmas holiday periods. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Saturday placement of the Valentine's Day holiday had a negative impact on revenues.\nConsumer Segment Operating Income\nConsumer segment operating income increased $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as revenue increased $3.1 million, as previously described, coupled with a $2.4 million decrease in operating expenses. Operating expenses were lower primarily due to decreases in cost of revenues of $2.1 million. The decrease in costs of revenues was driven by lower consumer orders as well as product and shipping cost savings. Further, segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 improved due to the breakage adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015 as noted above. The consumer segment operating margin increased to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 10% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nPROVIDE COMMERCE SEGMENT\nThe results of operations for Provide Commerce for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are presented below. The Acquisition was completed as of December 31, 2014. Therefore, no results for the year ended December 31, 2014 are included in our analysis.

The revenue decline was largely due to a 17% decline in the ProFlowers revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The Gourmet Foods business reported a 2% decrease in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Partially offsetting the decrease in revenues, the Personal Creations business reported 8% growth in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015. Both ProFlowers and Gourmet Foods revenues were negatively impacted by the Sunday timing of the Valentine's Day holiday period during 2016, which worsened from the Saturday timing in 2015. ProFlowers was also impacted by an overall decline in revenues due to lower investment in customer acquisition marketing, which reduced order volume during 2016.\nProvide Commerce Segment Operating Income\nProvide Commerce segment operating income decreased $1.3 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenues decreased $53.6 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of $52.3 million. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower cost of revenues associated with the lower order volume, partially offset by higher shipping costs. Lower marketing and selling costs and personnel-related costs also reduced operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. Further, segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 benefited from the second quarter 2015 actions associated with the restructuring of the Gifts.com business and the closure of the Kalla business as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Provide Commerce segment operating margin increased to 8% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 7% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFLORIST SEGMENT Table 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except for percentages and average revenues per member)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key metrics and other\nfinancial data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average revenues per member\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating margin\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nFlorist Segment Revenues\nFlorist segment revenues increased $1.1 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Services revenues increased $1.8 million due to a $1.0 million increase in subscription and other services revenues and an $0.8 million increase in order-related revenues. Products revenues decreased $0.7 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of fresh flowers. Average revenues per member increased 7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFlorist Segment Operating Income\nFlorist segment operating income increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the revenue increase of $1.1 million and a $1.6 million decrease in the cost of revenues. The cost of revenues decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in sales of fresh flowers and continued cost efficiencies realized across the business. General and administrative expenses increased $1.6 million driven largely by an increase in bad debt expense primarily related to one member and was partially offset by lower personnel costs. Florist segment operating margin increased to 29% for year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 28% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nFlorist Segment Revenues\nFlorist segment revenues increased $3.2 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Products revenues increased $3.2 million primarily due to an increase in sales of fresh flowers and technology systems. Services revenues were flat due to a $2.6 million decrease in subscription and other services revenues, offset by a $2.6 million increase in order-related revenues. Average revenues per member increased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nFlorist Segment Operating Income\nFlorist segment operating income increased $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as the revenue increase of $3.2 million was largely offset by a $3.1 million increase in operating expenses. Cost of revenues increased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by the increase in sales of fresh flowers offset by declines in services revenues. In addition, sales and marketing expenses were $3.0 million higher, primarily due to $3.4 million of incremental costs associated with increased order-related revenues, which was partially offset by a $0.4 million reduction in personnel-related costs. Florist segment operating margin decreased to 28% for year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 29% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nINTERNATIONAL SEGMENT Table 131: <table><tr><td> </td>

The increase in revenues in constant currency was primarily due to an increase in average order value of 3%. Consumer order volume for the year ended December 31, 2016 was relatively consistent with that of the year ended December 31, 2015 as modest growth in everyday order volume was offset by the Sunday placement of the Valentine's Day holiday in 2016 compared to the Saturday placement in 2015.\nInternational Segment Operating Income\nInternational segment operating income increased by $0.7 million (increased $3.0 million, or 16%, in constant currency) for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenues decreased $14.2 million (increased $4.5 million in constant currency) which was offset by a decrease in operating expenses of $15.0 million (increased $1.5 million in constant currency). Cost of revenues decreased $10.1 million (increased $2.8 million in constant currency). In constant currency, the increase in cost of revenues related to an increase in average order value. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $3.1 million ($0.9 million in constant currency) related to lower brand and direct marketing costs during 2016. General and administrative expenses decreased $1.8 million (decreased $0.4 million, or 3%, in constant currency). The decrease in constant currency was driven by a decrease in legal expenses partially offset by an increase in technology and personnel-related costs. International segment operating margin increased to 13% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nInternational Segment Revenues\nInternational segment revenues decreased $9.6 million, or 5%, (increased $3.5 million, or 2%, in constant currency), for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues in constant currency was primarily due to an increase in average order value of 2%. In addition, revenues increased in Interflora's florist business, driven by sales of wholesale products and increases in member fee revenues. Consumer order volume decreased 1%, primarily related to declines in the Valentine's Day and U.K. Mother's Day holiday periods, offset in part by overall growth in order volume outside of these holiday periods. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Saturday placement of the Valentine's Day holiday had a negative impact on revenues as expected.\nInternational Segment Operating Income\nInternational segment operating income decreased slightly by $0.2 million (increased $1.3 million, or 7%, in constant currency) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues decreased $9.6 million (increased $3.5 million in constant currency) which was offset in part by a decrease in operating expenses of $9.4 million (increased $2.2 million in constant currency). Cost of revenues decreased $7.7 million (increased $1.4 million in constant currency). In constant currency, the increase in cost of revenues related to an increase in average order value as well as costs associated with increased wholesale revenues. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $1.5 million (flat in constant currency) related to lower consumer order volume and closure of the U.K. garden center concession stands in 2014, partially offset by investments related to improving customer service and the customer experience. International segment operating margin was 11% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nUNALLOCATED EXPENSES\nThe Company incurs certain expenses which are not allocated to its four reportable segments.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 to 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except for percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnallocated expenses include various corporate costs, such as executive management, corporate finance, legal, and certain human resources costs. In addition, unallocated expenses include stock-based compensation for all eligible Company employees, restructuring and other exit costs, transaction-related costs, and litigation and dispute settlement charges and gains.\nUnallocated expenses increased $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $11.8 million, primarily associated with senior management changes and related accelerated vesting of equity awards and the closure and consolidation of certain locations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred restructuring costs of $6.1 million related to the closure of certain Provide Commerce developing businesses and locations. Litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries) increased $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Partially offsetting these increases was a $3.0 million decrease in transaction-related costs and a decrease in personnel-related costs of $0.3 million.\nUnallocated expenses increased $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $6.1 million, primarily associated with the closure of certain Provide Commerce developing businesses and locations. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $0.2 million of restructuring costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, personnel-related costs increased $8.8 million, primarily due to stock-based compensation increases of $5.6 million. In addition, costs related to audit and other professional fees and insurance increased $2.1 million. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in transaction-related costs of $5.7 million and in litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries) of $3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCredit Agreement\nOn September 19, 2014, FTD Companies, Inc. entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Interflora British Unit, certain wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of FTD Companies, Inc. party thereto as guarantors, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint lead arrangers and book managers, and Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent for the lenders, which provided for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of outstanding revolving loans and also provided for a revolving loan advance (the Acquisition Advance\u201d) to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition purchase price. On December 31, 2014, we borrowed $120 million under the Acquisition Advance to fund the cash portion of the Acquisition purchase price.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of FTD Companies, Inc.'s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (together with FTD Companies, Inc., the U.S. Loan Parties\u201d). In addition, the obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the U.S. Loan Parties, including a pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock of certain direct subsidiaries of the U.S. Loan Parties (except with respect to foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries whose assets consist primarily of foreign subsidiary equity interests, in which case such pledge is limited to 66% of the outstanding capital stock).\nThe interest rates applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement are based on either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% per annum to 2.50% per annum, or a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% per annum to 1.50% per annum, calculated according to the Company's net leverage ratio. At December 31, 2016, the base rate margin was 0.75% per annum and the LIBOR margin was 1.75% per annum. In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% per annum to 0.40% per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The stated interest rates (based on LIBOR) at December 31, 2016 under the term loan and the revolving credit facility were 2.75% and 2.52%, respectively. The effective interest rates at December 31, 2016 under the term loan and the revolving credit facility were 3.46% and 3.06%, respectively. The commitment fee rate at December 31, 2016 was 0.25%. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, affirmative covenants, and negative covenants, that, among other things, require the Company to maintain compliance with a maximum net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and impose restrictions and limitations on, among other things, investments, dividends, share repurchases, and asset sales, and the Company's ability to incur additional debt and additional liens. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2016.\nThe term loan is subject to amortization payments of $5 million per quarter and customary mandatory prepayments under certain conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company made scheduled payments of $20 million under the term loan. The outstanding balance of the term loan and all amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due upon maturity in September 2019. At December 31, 2016, the remaining borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement, which was reduced by $2.4 million in outstanding letters of credit, was $227.6 million.\nThe degree to which our assets are leveraged and the terms of our debt could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital, as well as the terms at which such capital might be offered to us. We currently expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months, including interest payment obligations, quarterly amortization payments, and mandatory prepayments, if any, under the Credit Agreement.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $23.1 million to $81.0 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $57.9 million at December 31, 2015. Our summary cash flows for the periods presented were as follows (in thousands): Table 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,557\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,190\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(114,102\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by/(used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,991\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90,692\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $5.4 million. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income/(loss) adjusted for non-cash items including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, deferred taxes, stock-based compensation, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was due to a higher net loss of $3.0 million, a decrease of $11.0 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments to vendors and lower accrued compensation during 2016, a $6.2 million decrease in accounts receivable, net, and a decrease of $4.4 million in non-cash items. The change in non-cash items was primarily related to decreases in deferred tax assets, gains on life insurance contracts, goodwill impairment, and depreciation and amortization, which were partially offset by increases in stock-based compensation due to accelerated vesting from senior management changes and the provision for doubtful accounts receivable. The decreases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $10.8 million increase in income taxes receivable and a $7.3 million increase in other liabilities. Changes in working capital can cause variation in our cash flows provided by operating activities due to seasonality, timing, and other factors.\nNet cash used for investing activities decreased by $11.6 million. Net cash used for investing activities decreased due to cash paid related to the Provide Commerce acquisition in 2015 combined with an increase in life insurance proceeds as compared to 2015. We currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for 2017 will be approximately $28 million. The actual amount of future capital expenditures may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, potential future acquisitions and new business initiatives, which are difficult to predict and which could change significantly over time. Additionally, technological advances may require us to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology in order to replace aging or technologically obsolete equipment.\nNet cash used for financing activities decreased by $54.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the repurchase of 0.6 million shares of common stock totaling $15.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $50.0 million of repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, repayments of $20.0 million of outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2016 were lower than net repayments of $40.0 million during 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also repurchased $2.3 million of our common stock related to withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units. We withhold shares to cover withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units and pay these taxes in cash. Proceeds of $2.2 million were received from the sale of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.\nWe currently expect to generate positive cash flows from operations at least for the next twelve months. We may use our existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund, among other things, working capital, stock repurchases, interest payment obligations, quarterly amortization payments and mandatory prepayments, if any, under the Credit Agreement, capital expenditures, and acquisitions.\nIf we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could severely constrain or prevent us from, among other factors, developing new or enhancing existing services or products, acquiring other services, businesses, or technologies, or funding significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as impair our ability to service our debt obligations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage of stock owned by the then-current stockholders could be reduced. Furthermore, such equity or any debt securities that we issue might have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to holders of our common stock. In addition, trends in the securities and credit markets may restrict our ability to raise any such additional funds, at least in the near term.\nOn February 27, 2014, our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program (the 2014 Repurchase Program\u201d) that allows us to repurchase up to $50 million of FTD common stock from time to time over a two-year period in both open market and privately negotiated transactions. No purchases were made under the 2014 Repurchase Program prior to 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had repurchased 1.8 million shares under the 2014 Repurchase Program at an average cost per share of $27.31, fully utilizing the $50 million authorization.\nOn March 8, 2016, our board of directors authorized a new common stock repurchase program (the 2016 Repurchase Program\u201d) that allows us to repurchase up to $60 million of FTD common stock from time to time over a two-year period in both open market and privately negotiated transactions. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repurchased 0.6 million shares under the 2016 Repurchase Program at an average cost of $25.37. The Company has $44.8 million of availability under this program for future repurchases. The objective of the 2016 Repurchase Program is to offset the dilutive effect on earnings per share from stock-based compensation and allow for opportunistic stock purchases to return capital to shareholders.\nOur ability to repurchase our common stock may be limited under our Investor Rights Agreement with Liberty, which provides that Liberty's ownership in the Company is capped at 40.0% of our common stock outstanding beginning January 1, 2017, subject to certain exceptions, including with respect to third-party tender offers. Liberty's ownership in FTD was 37.4% at December 31, 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $34.9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was due to a $101.7 million decrease in net income and a $10.8 million change in operating assets and liabilities which was more than offset by an increase of $147.4 million in non-cash items, primarily related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and depreciation and amortization. Changes in working capital can cause variation in our cash flows provided by operating activities due to seasonality, timing, and other factors.\nNet cash used for investing activities decreased by $85.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to a $96.7 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, as the acquisition of Provide Commerce was completed in the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash used for financing activities was $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $114.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in net cash used for/provided by financing activities was primarily due to net repayments of $40.0 million of outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, we paid $50.0 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares of our common stock under the 2014 Repurchase Program and $2.6 million related to withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2015. Proceeds of $1.6 million were received from the sale of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. During the year ended December 31, 2014, under the Credit Agreement, we entered into a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of outstanding revolving loans. In addition, we borrowed $120 million under the Acquisition Advance, as provided for in the Credit Agreement, to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition purchase price. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid $3.9 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Agreement as well as $2.4 million related to withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations at December 31, 2016 were as follows (in thousands): Table 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year to Less than 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 years to Less than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, including interest(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncancelable operating leases\n</td> <td>44,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>24,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation plans\n</td> <td>2,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>576\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities\n</td> <td>726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>379,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Interest obligations were estimated using implied forward interest rates for 3-month LIBOR based on quoted market rates from the U.S. dollar-denominated interest-rate swap curve.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> At December 31, 2016, we had liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $0.4 million, none of which is included in the table above, as we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments for long-term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions will occur.\nWe had $2.4 million of commitments under letters of credit at December 31, 2016 which were scheduled to expire within one year. Standby letters of credit are maintained by FTD to secure credit card processing activity and additional letters of credit are maintained related to inventory purchases, insurance policies and lease obligations.\nOther Commitments\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, sureties and insurance companies, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. We have entered into indemnification agreements with our current and former directors and certain of our officers and employees that require FTD, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. In addition, we have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers, directors, and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may, in certain circumstances, cover specified liabilities, including those arising from our obligation to indemnify our current and former directors, certain of our officers and employees, and certain former officers, directors, and employees of acquired companies.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS\nGeneral\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions that affect a number of reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following accounting policies, and estimates and assumptions made by management thereunder, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates and assumptions require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment and may be based on matters the effects of which are inherently uncertain.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe apply the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605\u201d), which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. ASC 605 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and no significant company obligations remain, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues exclude sales taxes.\nProducts revenues, less discounts and refunds, and the related cost of revenues are recognized when products are delivered to the customers. Shipping and service fees charged to customers are recognized at the time the related products revenues are recognized and are included in products revenues. Shipping and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues. Our consumer businesses generally recognize revenues on a gross basis because we bear the risks and rewards associated with the revenue-generating activities by (i) acting as a principal in the transaction; (ii) establishing prices; (iii) being responsible for fulfillment of the order by the floral network members and third-party suppliers; (iv) taking the risk of loss for collection, delivery and returns; and (v) marketing the products and services.\nServices revenues related to orders sent through the floral network are variable based on either the number of orders or on the value of orders and are recognized in the period in which the orders are delivered. Membership and other subscription-based fees are recognized monthly as earned, on a month-to-month basis.\nProbability of collection is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If it is determined that collectability is not reasonably assured, revenues are not recognized until collectability becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.\nAcquisitions\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business or a group of businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management. An operating segment is made up of one or more reporting units. The Company reports its business operations in four operating and reportable segments: Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International. Each of the Consumer, Florist, and International segments is a reporting unit. The Provide Commerce segment is comprised of two reporting units, ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods and Personal Creations. ProFlowers and Gourmet Foods businesses have similar margins and share operations and business team structure, among other similarities. Therefore these businesses meet the aggregation criteria, and as such, we have aggregated these two businesses into one reporting unit. We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment for these five reporting units. We elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management's estimate of their fair value. We account for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles, Goodwill and Other. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are reviewed for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would indicate it is more likely than not that the goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. Testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit excluding goodwill is compared to the net assets including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nIn calculating the fair value of the reporting units, we used a combination of the market approach and the income approach valuation methodologies. The income approach was used primarily, as we believe that a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. Under the market approach we used the guideline company method, which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select reasonably similar companies based on business description, revenue size, markets served and profitability. The key assumptions used in the income approach discounted cash flow valuation model included discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections, and terminal growth rates. The discount rate utilized is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in a similar business. Considering industry and company specific historical data and internal forecasts and projections, management developed growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. In determining the terminal growth rates, we considered GDP growth, consumer price inflation and the long term growth prospects of each reporting unit. The discount rate, growth rates, royalty rates, cash flow projections and terminal growth rates are also significant estimates used in the determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nThe determination of whether or not goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired involves a significant level of judgment and estimates in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe our analysis included sufficient tolerance for sensitivity in key assumptions. We believe the assumptions and rates used in our impairment assessments are reasonable, but they are judgmental, and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (1) forecasted order volumes and average order values, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics, and changes in consumer preferences; (2) marketing costs to generate orders; (3) product and fulfillment costs; (4) operational efficiency; and (5) equity valuations of peer companies.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the fair value of each of the Consumer, Florist, International, and Personal Creations reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values. Therefore, each of these reporting units passed step one of the goodwill impairment test and their goodwill was not determined to be impaired. The ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods reporting unit, a significant portion of the Provide Commerce reporting segment, failed step one of the goodwill impairment test and, based on the second step of the assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $84.0 million related to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 6- Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nCertain key assumptions used in determining the fair value for the Company's reporting units were as follows: Table 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Discount Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Terminal Growth Rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Florist\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal Creations\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe elected to perform the one-step quantitative impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets under ASC 350. Under the one-step quantitative impairment test, the fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are compared to their respective carrying amounts and, if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. The annual quantitative indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test resulted in the determination that the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts. Accordingly, we did not record any impairment charges related to our indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2016. Certain key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets were discount rates of 10.5% to 11% and average royalty rates of 2.5% to 3.7%.\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe account for finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management's estimate of their fair values. We evaluate the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, for impairment when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may indicate that an asset is impaired include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, a change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, shifts in technology, significant negative industry or economic trends, changes in our operating model or strategy, and competitive forces. In determining if an impairment exists, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets' carrying amounts and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the respective fair values of the assets. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to fifteen years. Our identifiable intangible assets were acquired primarily in connection with business combinations.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the asset group to be tested for recoverability. We are also required to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, and remaining economic lives of assets.\nAs a result of the impairment of the ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods' goodwill, we assessed if there was any impairment of intangible or other long-term assets within the ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods' reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In accordance with ASC 740, we recognize, in our consolidated financial statements, the impact of our tax positions that are more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions. We recognize interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and investigations. The Company records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates at least quarterly, developments in its legal matters that could affect the assessment of the probability of loss or the amount of liability, and makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company may be unable to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss due to various reasons, including, among others: (i) if the damages sought are indeterminate, (ii) if the proceedings are in early stages, (iii) if there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals, motions or settlements, (iv) if there are significant factual issues to be determined or resolved, and (v) if there are novel or unsettled legal theories presented. In such instances, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss, if any. We continually assess the potential liability related to such pending matters. Legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control. As such, there can be no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor information about recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to Note 1- Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, Accounting Policies, and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT \nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Discount Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Terminal Growth Rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Florist\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal Creations\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used for investing activities decreased by $11.6 million. Net cash used for investing activities decreased due to cash paid related to the Provide Commerce acquisition in 2015 combined with an increase in life insurance proceeds as compared to 2015. We currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for 2017 will be approximately $28 million. The actual amount of future capital expenditures may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, potential future acquisitions and new business initiatives, which are difficult to predict and which could change significantly over time. Additionally, technological advances may require us to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology in order to replace aging or technologically obsolete equipment.\nConsolidated sales and marketing expenses decreased $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a decrease of $12.5 million in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Provide Commerce segment, a decrease of $4.5 million related to our Consumer segment, and a decrease of $3.1 million (decrease of $0.9 million in constant currency) associated with our International segment. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $2.2 million favorable impact on sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was 20% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,557\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,190\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(114,102\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by/(used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,991\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90,692\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvide Commerce segment operating income decreased $1.3 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenues decreased $53.6 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of $52.3 million. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower cost of revenues associated with the lower order volume, partially offset by higher shipping costs. Lower marketing and selling costs and personnel-related costs also reduced operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. Further, segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 benefited from the second quarter 2015 actions associated with the restructuring of the Gifts.com business and the closure of the Kalla business as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Provide Commerce segment operating margin increased to 8% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 7% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInternational segment operating income increased by $0.7 million (increased $3.0 million, or 16%, in constant currency) for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenues decreased $14.2 million (increased $4.5 million in constant currency) which was offset by a decrease in operating expenses of $15.0 million (increased $1.5 million in constant currency). Cost of revenues decreased $10.1 million (increased $2.8 million in constant currency). In constant currency, the increase in cost of revenues related to an increase in average order value. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $3.1 million ($0.9 million in constant currency) related to lower brand and direct marketing costs during 2016. General and administrative expenses decreased $1.8 million (decreased $0.4 million, or 3%, in constant currency). The decrease in constant currency was driven by a decrease in legal expenses partially offset by an increase in technology and personnel-related costs.

by a 10% decrease in order volume, partially offset by a 1% increase in average order value. In 2016, consumer order volume was negatively impacted by the Sunday timing of the Valentine's Day holiday, which worsened from the Saturday placement of the holiday in 2015. During 2016, we elected to shift certain group buying placements to the Provide Commerce segment and also reduce the number of partners due to changes in some partners' marketing strategies. Both of these changes had an impact on revenues in these programs for 2016. In addition, revenue was lower for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to $4.1 million of breakage revenue which was recognized in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of our determination, based on a change in circumstances, that there was no longer a requirement to remit to relevant jurisdictions, under unclaimed property laws, the value of certain gift cards and vouchers which are not expected to be redeemed ( breakage\u201d). Breakage revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 was not significant.\nFlorist segment revenues increased $1.1 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Services revenues increased $1.8 million due to a $1.0 million increase in subscription and other services revenues and an $0.8 million increase in order-related revenues. Products revenues decreased $0.7 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of fresh flowers. Average revenues per member increased 7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nPrior to the Acquisition, we reported our business operations in three reportable segments: Consumer, Florist, and International. As a result of the Acquisition, which was completed on December 31, 2014, we began reporting our business in four reportable segments: Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International.\nTable

$0.2 million (increased $1.3 million, or 7%, in constant currency) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues decreased $9.6 million (increased $3.5 million in constant currency) which was offset in part by a decrease in operating expenses of $9.4 million (increased $2.2 million in constant currency). Cost of revenues decreased $7.7 million (increased $1.4 million in constant currency). In constant currency, the increase in cost of revenues related to an increase in average order value as well as costs associated with increased wholesale revenues. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $1.5 million (flat in constant currency) related to lower consumer order volume and closure of the U.K. garden center concession stands in 2014, partially offset by investments related to improving customer service and the customer experience. International segment operating margin was 11% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nConsumer orders. We monitor the number of consumer orders for floral, gift, and related products during a given period. Consumer orders are individual units delivered during the period that originated in the U.S. and Canada, primarily through the www.ftd.com, www.proflowers.com, www.berries.com, and www.personalcreations.com websites, associated mobile sites and applications, the 1-800-SEND-FTD telephone number and various other telephone numbers; and in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland, primarily through the www.interflora.co.uk, www.flyingflowers.co.uk, and www.interflora.ie websites, associated mobile sites and applications, and various telephone numbers. The number of consumer orders is not adjusted for non-delivered orders that are refunded on or after the scheduled delivery date. Orders originating with a florist or other retail location for delivery to consumers are not included as part of this number.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\n (a) The impact of foreign currency reflects the impact of the change in the foreign currency exchange rate from the prior period to the current period. We calculate the impact by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period.  We present certain results from our International segment on a constant currency basis. Constant currency information permits the comparison of results between periods as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. Our International segment operates principally in the U.K. We calculate constant currency by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period.\nProvide Commerce segment revenues decreased $53.6 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by a 9% decrease in consumer order volume combined with a 1% decrease in average order value. The revenue decline was largely due to a 17% decline in the ProFlowers revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The Gourmet Foods business reported a 2% decrease in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Partially offsetting the decrease in revenues, the Personal Creations business reported 8% growth in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015. Both ProFlowers and Gourmet Foods revenues were negatively impacted by the Sunday timing of the Valentine's Day holiday period during 2016, which worsened from the Saturday timing in 2015. ProFlowers was also impacted by an overall decline in revenues due to lower investment in customer acquisition marketing, which reduced order volume during 2016.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nConsolidated Cost of Revenues\nIn calculating the fair value of the reporting units, we used a combination of the market approach and the income approach valuation methodologies. The income approach was used primarily, as we believe that a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. Under the market approach we used the guideline company method, which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select reasonably similar companies based on business description, revenue size, markets served and profitability. The key assumptions used in the income approach discounted cash flow valuation model included discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections, and terminal growth rates. The discount rate utilized is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in a similar business. Considering industry and company specific historical data and internal forecasts and projections, management developed growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. In determining the terminal growth rates, we considered GDP growth, consumer price inflation and the long term growth prospects of each reporting unit. The discount rate, growth rates, royalty rates, cash flow projections and terminal growth rates are also significant estimates used in the determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nThe degree to which our assets are leveraged and the terms of our debt could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital, as well as the terms at which such capital might be offered to us. We currently expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months, including interest payment obligations, quarterly amortization payments, and mandatory prepayments, if any, under the Credit Agreement.\nFlorist Segment Revenues\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a tax benefit of $5.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $88.3 million, compared to a tax benefit of $1.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the impairment of goodwill is not tax deductible, and therefore, there is no tax benefit recorded on the charges. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the effective tax rate increased primarily due to the higher pre-tax loss and lower non-deductible expenses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nConsolidated general and administrative expenses increased $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $37.2 million of general and administrative expenses associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment, excluding depreciation and transaction-related costs. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2015, depreciation expense increased $9.3 million primarily due to assets acquired in the Acquisition. Further, personnel-related costs, excluding those directly related to the Provide Commerce segment, increased $7.9 million, primarily due to increased stock-based compensation. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in transaction-related costs of $5.7 million due to a majority of the transaction costs related to the Acquisition being recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries) were $3.1 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2015, than the year ended December 31, 2014. Consolidated general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was 10% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 12% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThrough our Consumer segment, we are a leading direct marketer of floral and gift products for consumers, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Our Consumer segment operates primarily through the www.ftd.com website, associated mobile sites, and the 1-800-SEND-FTD telephone number. Through our Provide Commerce segment, we are a leading direct marketer of floral and gift products for consumers, including food gifts, personalized gifts, and other gifting products, primarily in the U.S. Our Provide Commerce segment operates primarily through our www.proflowers.com, www.berries.com, www.personalcreations.com, www.proplants.com, and www.gifts.com websites, associated mobile sites and applications, and various telephone numbers. Through our Florist segment, we are a leading provider of products and services to our floral network members, including services that enable our floral network members to send, receive, and deliver floral orders. Floral network members include traditional retail florists, as well as other non-florist retail locations, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Our Florist segment also provides products and services to other companies in need of floral and gifting solutions. Our International segment consists of Interflora, which operates primarily in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. Interflora is a premier direct marketer of floral and non-floral gift products, including bears, chocolates, wine, and tailored food products for consumers and operates primarily through the www.interflora.co.uk, www.flyingflowers.co.uk, www.flowersdirect.co.uk, and www.interflora.ie websites, associated mobile sites and applications, and various telephone numbers. Interflora also provides products and services to floral network members, funeral directors, independent gift shops, other retailers, and to other companies in need of floral and gifting solutions.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of FTD Companies, Inc.'s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (together with FTD Companies, Inc., the U.S. Loan Parties\u201d). In addition, the obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the U.S. Loan Parties, including a pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock of certain direct subsidiaries of the U.S. Loan Parties (except with respect to foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries whose assets consist primarily of foreign subsidiary equity interests, in which case such pledge is limited to 66% of the outstanding capital stock).\nThis MD&A is a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and provides additional information on our business, recent developments, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, cash flows, and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and the other sections of this Form 10-K.\nKEY BUSINESS METRICS\nWe present certain results from our International segment on a constant currency basis. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. Our International segment operates principally in the U.K. We calculate constant currency by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period. In addition, we have excluded intersegment revenues and expenses in the discussion below.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nFlorist segment operating income increased $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as the revenue increase of $3.2 million was largely offset by a $3.1 million increase in operating expenses. Cost of revenues increased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by the increase in sales of fresh flowers offset by declines in services revenues. In addition, sales and marketing expenses were $3.0 million higher, primarily due to $3.4 million of incremental costs associated with increased order-related revenues, which was partially offset by a $0.4 million reduction in personnel-related costs. Florist segment operating margin decreased to 28% for year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 29% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInternational segment revenues decreased $14.2 million, or 9%, (increased $4.5 million, or 3%, in constant currency), for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenues in constant currency was primarily due to an increase in average order value of 3%. Consumer order volume for the year ended December 31, 2016 was relatively consistent with that of the year ended December 31, 2015 as modest growth in everyday order volume was offset by the Sunday placement of the Valentine's Day holiday in 2016 compared to the Saturday placement in 2015.\nFlorist segment revenues increased $3.2 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Products revenues increased $3.2 million primarily due to an increase in sales of fresh flowers and technology systems. Services revenues were flat due to a $2.6 million decrease in subscription and other services revenues, offset by a $2.6 million increase in order-related revenues. Average revenues per member increased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther Commitments\nOn March 8, 2016, our board of directors authorized a new common stock repurchase program (the 2016 Repurchase Program\u201d) that allows us to repurchase up to $60 million of FTD common stock from time to time over a two-year period in both open market and privately negotiated transactions. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repurchased 0.6 million shares under the 2016 Repurchase Program at an average cost of $25.37. The Company has $44.8 million of availability under this program for future repurchases. The objective of the 2016 Repurchase Program is to offset the dilutive effect on earnings per share from stock-based compensation and allow for opportunistic stock purchases to return capital to shareholders.\nConsumer segment operating income decreased $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the decrease in revenues of $30.1 million, as previously described, partially offset by a $23.5 million decrease in operating expenses. Operating expenses were lower primarily due to a decrease in cost of revenues of $17.4 million, which was driven by reduced spending associated with lower order volume. Other operating expenses decreased $6.2 million primarily due to reduced spending associated with lower order volume, lower fixed costs in the customer service area, and lower technology and development costs. In addition, segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was lower compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the breakage adjustment. The consumer segment operating margin decreased to 10% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInternational Segment Revenues\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nFlorist Segment Operating Income\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management's estimate of their fair value. We account for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles, Goodwill and Other. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are reviewed for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would indicate it is more likely than not that the goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. Testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit excluding goodwill is compared to the net assets including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nThe determination of whether or not goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired involves a significant level of judgment and estimates in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe our analysis included sufficient tolerance for sensitivity in key assumptions. We believe the assumptions and rates used in our impairment assessments are reasonable, but they are judgmental, and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (1) forecasted order volumes and average order values, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics, and changes in consumer preferences; (2) marketing costs to generate orders; (3) product and fulfillment costs; (4) operational efficiency; and (5) equity valuations of peer companies.\n \nIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, sureties and insurance companies, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. We have entered into indemnification agreements with our current and former directors and certain of our officers and employees that require FTD, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. In addition, we have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers, directors, and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may, in certain circumstances, cover specified liabilities, including those arising from our obligation to indemnify our current and former directors, certain of our officers and employees, and certain former officers, directors, and employees of acquired companies.\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In accordance with ASC 740, we recognize, in our consolidated financial statements, the impact of our tax positions that are more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions. We recognize interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nAcquisitions\nSegment operating income. Our chief operating decision maker uses segment operating income to evaluate the performance of our business segments and to make decisions about allocating resources among segments. Segment operating income is operating income excluding depreciation, amortization, litigation and dispute settlement charges and gains, transaction-related costs, restructuring and other exit costs, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Stock-based compensation and general corporate expenses are not allocated to the segments. Segment operating income is prior to intersegment eliminations and excludes other income (expense), net. See Note 3- Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated operating income and consolidated income before income taxes.\nInterest expense was consistent for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The savings related to the lower level of debt principal balances were offset by slightly higher interest rates and amortization of the interest rate cap.\nWe currently expect to generate positive cash flows from operations at least for the next twelve months. We may use our existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund, among other things, working capital, stock repurchases, interest payment obligations, quarterly amortization payments and mandatory prepayments, if any, under the Credit Agreement, capital expenditures, and acquisitions.\nProbability of collection is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If it is determined that collectability is not reasonably assured, revenues are not recognized until collectability becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.\nNet cash used for investing activities decreased by $85.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to a $96.7 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, as the acquisition of Provide Commerce was completed in the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\nUNALLOCATED EXPENSES\nConsumer Segment Revenues\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFlorist Segment Operating Income\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nWe elected to perform the one-step quantitative impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets under ASC 350. Under the one-step quantitative impairment test, the fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are compared to their respective carrying amounts and, if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. The annual quantitative indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test resulted in the determination that the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts. Accordingly, we did not record any impairment charges related to our indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2016. Certain key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets were discount rates of 10.5% to 11% and average royalty rates of 2.5% to 3.7%.\nConsolidated sales and marketing expenses increased $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $136.0 million of sales and marketing expenses associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment and an increase of $3.0 million in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Florist segment. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $1.5 million (increase $0.1 million in constant currency) and $0.4 million in sales and marketing expenses associated with our International and Consumer segments, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $1.6 million favorable impact on sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 17% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nConsolidated cost of revenues increased $363.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated cost of revenues was primarily due to $368.4 million of costs associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment and a $0.2 million increase in costs associated with our Florist segment, offset by a $7.7 million decrease (increase $1.3 in constant currency) in costs associated with our International segment and a $2.1 million decrease in costs associated with our Consumer segment. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $9.0 million favorable impact on cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, depreciation expense increased $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Consolidated cost of revenues, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, remained consistent at 63% for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, our consolidated revenues, segment revenues, segment operating income, consumer orders, average order values, average revenues per member, and average currency exchange rates. Since the acquisition of Provide Commerce was completed on December 31, 2014, no results of operations were included for this segment for the year ended December 31 2014. \nInterest Expense, Net\nProvide Commerce Segment Revenues\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $85.0 million related to the Provide Commerce segment.\nFor information about recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to Note 1- Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, Accounting Policies, and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAs a result of the impairment of the ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods' goodwill, we assessed if there was any impairment of intangible or other long-term assets within the ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods' reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired.\nOVERVIEW\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nConsolidated Sales and Marketing\nIf we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could severely constrain or prevent us from, among other factors, developing new or enhancing existing services or products, acquiring other services, businesses, or technologies, or funding significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as impair our ability to service our debt obligations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage of stock owned by the then-current stockholders could be reduced. Furthermore, such equity or any debt securities that we issue might have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to holders of our common stock. In addition, trends in the securities and credit markets may restrict our ability to raise any such additional funds, at least in the near term.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $11.8 million, primarily related to senior management changes, including expenses for severance and related accelerated vesting of equity awards. In addition, we incurred restructuring charges related to the consolidation of certain office and distribution facilities for the Provide Commerce segment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $6.1 million, primarily related to the closure of the Provide Commerce developing businesses and certain distribution and call center locations.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS\nWe review a number of key business metrics to help us monitor our performance and trends affecting our segments and to develop forecasts and budgets. These key metrics include the following:\n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nConsolidated revenues increased $579.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily due to $583.3 million of revenues associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment, a $3.1 million increase in revenues from our Consumer segment, and a $3.2 million increase in revenues from our Florist segment, partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease ($3.5 million increase in constant currency) in revenues from our International segment. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenues by $13.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.1 million on pre-tax loss of $81.3 million, compared to a tax provision of $9.5 million on pre-tax income of $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the impairment of goodwill is not tax deductible, and therefore, there is no tax benefit recorded on the charge. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to book losses in the U.S. resulting from the goodwill impairment and the amortization of the intangibles acquired in the Acquisition.\nNet cash used for financing activities decreased by $54.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the repurchase of 0.6 million shares of common stock totaling $15.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $50.0 million of repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, repayments of $20.0 million of outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2016 were lower than net repayments of $40.0 million during 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also repurchased $2.3 million of our common stock related to withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units. We withhold shares to cover withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units and pay these taxes in cash. Proceeds of $2.2 million were received from the sale of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.\nConsumer Segment Revenues\n (a) Interest obligations were estimated using implied forward interest rates for 3-month LIBOR based on quoted market rates from the U.S. dollar-denominated interest-rate swap curve.  At December 31, 2016, we had liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $0.4 million, none of which is included in the table above, as we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments for long-term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions will occur.\nUnallocated expenses increased $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $11.8 million, primarily associated with senior management changes and related accelerated vesting of equity awards and the closure and consolidation of certain locations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred restructuring costs of $6.1 million related to the closure of certain Provide Commerce developing businesses and locations. Litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries) increased $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Partially offsetting these increases was a $3.0 million decrease in transaction-related costs and a decrease in personnel-related costs of $0.3 million.\nConsolidated revenues decreased $96.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenues was primarily due to a decrease of $53.6 million in revenues from our Provide Commerce segment, a $30.1 million decrease in revenues from our Consumer segment, and a $14.2 million decrease in revenues from our International segment (increase of $4.5 million in constant currency). Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenues by $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral\nConsolidated cost of revenues decreased $63.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated cost of revenues was primarily due a decrease of $33.4 million in costs associated with our Provide Commerce segment, a decrease of $17.4 million in costs associated with our Consumer segment, and a decrease of $10.1 million (increase of $2.8 million in constant currency) in costs associated with our International segment. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $12.8 million favorable impact on cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consolidated cost of revenues, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, remained constant at 63% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the fair value of each of the Consumer, Florist, International, and Personal Creations reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values. Therefore, each of these reporting units passed step one of the goodwill impairment test and their goodwill was not determined to be impaired. The ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods reporting unit, a significant portion of the Provide Commerce reporting segment, failed step one of the goodwill impairment test and, based on the second step of the assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $84.0 million related to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 6- Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nProducts revenues, less discounts and refunds, and the related cost of revenues are recognized when products are delivered to the customers. Shipping and service fees charged to customers are recognized at the time the related products revenues are recognized and are included in products revenues. Shipping and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues. Our consumer businesses generally recognize revenues on a gross basis because we bear the risks and rewards associated with the revenue-generating activities by (i) acting as a principal in the transaction; (ii) establishing prices; (iii) being responsible for fulfillment of the order by the floral network members and third-party suppliers; (iv) taking the risk of loss for collection, delivery and returns; and (v) marketing the products and services.\nThe Company incurs certain expenses which are not allocated to its four reportable segments.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nInternational Segment Operating Income\nThe term loan is subject to amortization payments of $5 million per quarter and customary mandatory prepayments under certain conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company made scheduled payments of $20 million under the term loan. The outstanding balance of the term loan and all amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due upon maturity in September 2019. At December 31, 2016, the remaining borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement, which was reduced by $2.4 million in outstanding letters of credit, was $227.6 million.\nOur ability to repurchase our common stock may be limited under our Investor Rights Agreement with Liberty, which provides that Liberty's ownership in the Company is capped at 40.0% of our common stock outstanding beginning January 1, 2017, subject to certain exceptions, including with respect to third-party tender offers. Liberty's ownership in FTD was 37.4% at December 31, 2016.\nAs a result of the Acquisition, our operating and reportable segments changed to include a fourth segment, Provide Commerce. Accordingly, beginning December 31, 2014, our operating and reportable segments consist of Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International. However, as the Acquisition was completed on December 31, 2014, no results of operations of Provide Commerce were included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. For additional information about our reportable segments refer to MD&A and Note 3- Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Sales and Marketing\nFlorist segment operating income increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the revenue increase of $1.1 million and a $1.6 million decrease in the cost of revenues. The cost of revenues decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in sales of fresh flowers and continued cost efficiencies realized across the business. General and administrative expenses increased $1.6 million driven largely by an increase in bad debt expense primarily related to one member and was partially offset by lower personnel costs. Florist segment operating margin increased to 29% for year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 28% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe have revised the previously reported consolidated financial statements and related metrics for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 for certain errors that were not material in any of the years revised. See Note 17-Immaterial Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements in the Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\n (a) Segment revenues are prior to intersegment eliminations. See Note 3- Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment revenues to consolidated revenues. \nFor additional information about our reportable segments refer to Note 3- Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, selected historical consolidated statements of operations data. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions,\u201d Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d and Contractual Obligations, Other Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,\u201d included in this Item 7, and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \nOn February 27, 2014, our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program (the 2014 Repurchase Program\u201d) that allows us to repurchase up to $50 million of FTD common stock from time to time over a two-year period in both open market and privately negotiated transactions. No purchases were made under the 2014 Repurchase Program prior to 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had repurchased 1.8 million shares under the 2014 Repurchase Program at an average cost per share of $27.31, fully utilizing the $50 million authorization.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $5.4 million. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income/(loss) adjusted for non-cash items including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, deferred taxes, stock-based compensation, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was due to a higher net loss of $3.0 million, a decrease of $11.0 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments to vendors and lower accrued compensation during 2016, a $6.2 million decrease in accounts receivable, net, and a decrease of $4.4 million in non-cash items. The change in non-cash items was primarily related to decreases in deferred tax assets, gains on life insurance contracts, goodwill impairment, and depreciation and amortization, which were partially offset by increases in stock-based compensation due to accelerated vesting from senior management changes and the provision for doubtful accounts receivable. The decreases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $10.8 million increase in income taxes receivable and a $7.3 million increase in other liabilities. Changes in working capital can cause variation in our cash flows provided by operating activities due to seasonality, timing, and other factors.\nPROVIDE COMMERCE SEGMENT\nInterest expense increased $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increases were due to higher debt principal balances outstanding, associated with the incremental borrowing for the Acquisition, as well as higher interest rates and increased amortization of both the interest rate cap and deferred financing fees.\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business or a group of businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management. An operating segment is made up of one or more reporting units. The Company reports its business operations in four operating and reportable segments: Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International. Each of the Consumer, Florist, and International segments is a reporting unit. The Provide Commerce segment is comprised of two reporting units, ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods and Personal Creations. ProFlowers and Gourmet Foods businesses have similar margins and share operations and business team structure, among other similarities. Therefore these businesses meet the aggregation criteria, and as such, we have aggregated these two businesses into one reporting unit. We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment for these five reporting units. We elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nContractual Obligations\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nOn September 19, 2014, FTD Companies, Inc. entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Interflora British Unit, certain wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of FTD Companies, Inc. party thereto as guarantors, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint lead arrangers and book managers, and Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent for the lenders, which provided for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of outstanding revolving loans and also provided for a revolving loan advance (the Acquisition Advance\u201d) to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition purchase price. On December 31, 2014, we borrowed $120 million under the Acquisition Advance to fund the cash portion of the Acquisition purchase price.\nAt December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nAverage order value. We monitor the average value for consumer orders delivered in a given period, which we refer to as the average order value. Average order value represents the average amount received for consumer orders delivered during a period. The average order value of consumer orders within our Consumer, Provide Commerce, and International segments is tracked in their local currency, the U.S. Dollar ( USD\u201d) for both the Consumer and Provide Commerce segments and the British Pound ( GBP\u201d) for the International segment. The local currency amounts received for the International segment are then translated into USD at the average currency exchange rate for the period. Average order value includes merchandise revenues and shipping or service fees paid by the consumer less discounts and refunds (net of refund-related fees charged to floral network members).\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nInterest Expense, Net\nReportable Segments\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the intangible assets acquired in the Acquisition.\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and investigations. The Company records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates at least quarterly, developments in its legal matters that could affect the assessment of the probability of loss or the amount of liability, and makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company may be unable to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss due to various reasons, including, among others: (i) if the damages sought are indeterminate, (ii) if the proceedings are in early stages, (iii) if there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals, motions or settlements, (iv) if there are significant factual issues to be determined or resolved, and (v) if there are novel or unsettled legal theories presented. In such instances, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss, if any. We continually assess the potential liability related to such pending matters. Legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control. As such, there can be no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFlorist Segment Revenues\nAcquisition of Provide Commerce\nServices revenues related to orders sent through the floral network are variable based on either the number of orders or on the value of orders and are recognized in the period in which the orders are delivered. Membership and other subscription-based fees are recognized monthly as earned, on a month-to-month basis.\nPrior to the Acquisition, the Company reported its business operations in three reportable segments: Consumer, Florist, and International. As a result of the Acquisition, the Company began reporting its business in four reportable segments: Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International. Segment operating income is operating income excluding depreciation, amortization, litigation and dispute settlement charges or gains, transaction-related costs, restructuring and other exit costs, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Stock-based compensation and general corporate expenses are not allocated to the segments. Segment operating income is prior to intersegment eliminations and excludes other income, net.\nInternational segment revenues decreased $9.6 million, or 5%, (increased $3.5 million, or 2%, in constant currency), for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues in constant currency was primarily due to an increase in average order value of 2%. In addition, revenues increased in Interflora's florist business, driven by sales of wholesale products and increases in member fee revenues. Consumer order volume decreased 1%, primarily related to declines in the Valentine's Day and U.K. Mother's Day holiday periods, offset in part by overall growth in order volume outside of these holiday periods. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Saturday placement of the Valentine's Day holiday had a negative impact on revenues as expected.\nOn December 31, 2014, we acquired from a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive Corporation ( Liberty\u201d) all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Provide Commerce, Inc. ( Provide Commerce\u201d), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty, for a purchase price consisting of (i) cash consideration of $106.6 million, excluding acquired cash on hand of $38.1 million and a post-closing working capital adjustment of $9.9 million, and (ii) 10.2 million shares of FTD common stock (the Acquisition\u201d). At the closing of the Acquisition, these shares represented approximately 35% of the issued and outstanding shares of FTD common stock. In April 2015, FTD made a payment to Liberty in full satisfaction of the post-closing working capital adjustment. Upon the closing of the Acquisition, Provide Commerce became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FTD.\nConsumer segment operating income increased $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as revenue increased $3.1 million, as previously described, coupled with a $2.4 million decrease in operating expenses. Operating expenses were lower primarily due to decreases in cost of revenues of $2.1 million. The decrease in costs of revenues was driven by lower consumer orders as well as product and shipping cost savings. Further, segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 improved due to the breakage adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015 as noted above. The consumer segment operating margin increased to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 10% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe results of operations for Provide Commerce for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are presented below. The Acquisition was completed as of December 31, 2014. Therefore, no results for the year ended December 31, 2014 are included in our analysis. \nIncome Taxes\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.\nConsolidated General and Administrative\nNet cash used for financing activities was $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $114.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in net cash used for/provided by financing activities was primarily due to net repayments of $40.0 million of outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, we paid $50.0 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares of our common stock under the 2014 Repurchase Program and $2.6 million related to withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2015. Proceeds of $1.6 million were received from the sale of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. During the year ended December 31, 2014, under the Credit Agreement, we entered into a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of outstanding revolving loans. In addition, we borrowed $120 million under the Acquisition Advance, as provided for in the Credit Agreement, to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition purchase price. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid $3.9 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Agreement as well as $2.4 million related to withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $34.9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was due to a $101.7 million decrease in net income and a $10.8 million change in operating assets and liabilities which was more than offset by an increase of $147.4 million in non-cash items, primarily related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and depreciation and amortization. Changes in working capital can cause variation in our cash flows provided by operating activities due to seasonality, timing, and other factors.\nConsolidated general and administrative expenses decreased $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs of $6.5 million, which included a decrease in headcount, incentive compensation expense, and stock-based compensation. In addition, transaction-related costs also decreased $2.9 million, facility costs decreased $1.0 million, and technology costs decreased $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Legal costs, including litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries), also decreased $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These decreases were partially offset by increases in bad debt expense of $1.8 million and depreciation expense of $0.6 million. Consolidated general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was stable at 10% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $84.0 million related to the Provide Commerce segment compared to a goodwill impairment charge of $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nUnallocated expenses increased $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $6.1 million, primarily associated with the closure of certain Provide Commerce developing businesses and locations. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $0.2 million of restructuring costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, personnel-related costs increased $8.8 million, primarily due to stock-based compensation increases of $5.6 million. In addition, costs related to audit and other professional fees and insurance increased $2.1 million. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in transaction-related costs of $5.7 million and in litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries) of $3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe segment results included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 3-Segment Information to the Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is also presented on this basis.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $6.1 million, primarily related to the closure of the Provide Commerce developing businesses certain distribution and call center locations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $0.2 million, primarily related to the closure of various U.K. garden center concession stands.\nConsolidated Revenues\nWe had $2.4 million of commitments under letters of credit at December 31, 2016 which were scheduled to expire within one year. Standby letters of credit are maintained by FTD to secure credit card processing activity and additional letters of credit are maintained related to inventory purchases, insurance policies and lease obligations.\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $23.1 million to $81.0 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $57.9 million at December 31, 2015. Our summary cash flows for the periods presented were as follows (in thousands): \nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions that affect a number of reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following accounting policies, and estimates and assumptions made by management thereunder, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates and assumptions require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment and may be based on matters the effects of which are inherently uncertain.\nUnallocated expenses include various corporate costs, such as executive management, corporate finance, legal, and certain human resources costs. In addition, unallocated expenses include stock-based compensation for all eligible Company employees, restructuring and other exit costs, transaction-related costs, and litigation and dispute settlement charges and gains.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the asset group to be tested for recoverability. We are also required to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, and remaining economic lives of assets.\nCertain key assumptions used in determining the fair value for the Company's reporting units were as follows: \nConsolidated Revenues\nContractual obligations at December 31, 2016 were as follows (in thousands): \nAverage revenues per member. We monitor average revenues per member for our floral network members in the Florist segment. Average revenues per member represents the average revenues earned from a member of our floral network during a period. Revenues include services revenues and products revenues but exclude revenues from sales to non-members. Floral network members include our retail florists and other non-florist retail locations who offer floral and gifting solutions. Average revenues per member is calculated by dividing Florist segment revenues for the period, excluding sales to non-members, by the average number of floral network members for the period.\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS\nCredit Agreement\nConsumer segment revenues slightly increased $3.1 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The Consumer segment recognized breakage revenue of $4.1 million during the third quarter of 2015 as noted above. Segment revenues improved as average order value increased 2% primarily driven by consumers selecting higher value offerings, our sympathy business, which typically carries higher average order values, and other merchandising improvements. Revenue increases were partially offset by the consumer order volume decrease of 2%, primarily related to declines during the Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and Christmas holiday periods. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Saturday placement of the Valentine's Day holiday had a negative impact on revenues.\nThe interest rates applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement are based on either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% per annum to 2.50% per annum, or a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% per annum to 1.50% per annum, calculated according to the Company's net leverage ratio. At December 31, 2016, the base rate margin was 0.75% per annum and the LIBOR margin was 1.75% per annum. In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% per annum to 0.40% per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The stated interest rates (based on LIBOR) at December 31, 2016 under the term loan and the revolving credit facility were 2.75% and 2.52%, respectively. The effective interest rates at December 31, 2016 under the term loan and the revolving credit facility were 3.46% and 3.06%, respectively. The commitment fee rate at December 31, 2016 was 0.25%. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, affirmative covenants, and negative covenants, that, among other things, require the Company to maintain compliance with a maximum net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and impose restrictions and limitations on, among other things, investments, dividends, share repurchases, and asset sales, and the Company's ability to incur additional debt and additional liens. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2016.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nConsolidated Cost of Revenues\nCONSUMER SEGMENT \nConsumer Segment Operating Income\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nProvide Commerce Segment Operating Income\nInternational Segment Revenues\n \nFTD Companies, Inc.

Net cash used for investing activities decreased due to cash paid related to the Provide Commerce acquisition in 2015 combined with an increase in life insurance proceeds as compared to 2015. We currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for 2017 will be approximately $28 million. The actual amount of future capital expenditures may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, potential future acquisitions and new business initiatives, which are difficult to predict and which could change significantly over time. Additionally, technological advances may require us to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology in order to replace aging or technologically obsolete equipment.\nConsolidated sales and marketing expenses decreased $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a decrease of $12.5 million in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Provide Commerce segment, a decrease of $4.5 million related to our Consumer segment, and a decrease of $3.1 million (decrease of $0.9 million in constant currency) associated with our International segment. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $2.2 million favorable impact on sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was 20% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nProvide Commerce segment operating income decreased $1.3 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenues decreased $53.6 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of $52.3 million. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower cost of revenues associated with the lower order volume, partially offset by higher shipping costs. Lower marketing and selling costs and personnel-related costs also reduced operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. Further, segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 benefited from the second quarter 2015 actions associated with the restructuring of the Gifts.com business and the closure of the Kalla business as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Provide Commerce segment operating margin increased to 8% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 7% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInternational segment operating income increased by $0.7 million (increased $3.0 million, or 16%, in constant currency) for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenues decreased $14.2 million (increased $4.5 million in constant currency) which was offset by a decrease in operating expenses of $15.0 million (increased $1.5 million in constant currency). Cost of revenues decreased $10.1 million (increased $2.8 million in constant currency). In constant currency, the increase in cost of revenues related to an increase in average order value. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $3.1 million ($0.9 million in constant currency) related to lower brand and direct marketing costs during 2016. General and administrative expenses decreased $1.8 million (decreased $0.4 million, or 3%, in constant currency). The decrease in constant currency was driven by a decrease in legal expenses partially offset by an increase in technology and personnel-related costs. International segment operating margin increased to 13% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nWe account for finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management's estimate of their fair values. We evaluate the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, for impairment when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may indicate that an asset is impaired include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, a change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, shifts in technology, significant negative industry or economic trends, changes in our operating model or strategy, and competitive forces. In determining if an impairment exists, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets' carrying amounts and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the respective fair values of the assets. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to fifteen years. Our identifiable intangible assets were acquired primarily in connection with business combinations.\nWe apply the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605\u201d), which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. ASC 605 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and no significant company obligations remain, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues exclude sales taxes.\nConsolidated General and Administrative\nRevenue Recognition\nConsumer segment revenues decreased $30.1 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by a 10% decrease in order volume, partially offset by a 1% increase in average order value. In 2016, consumer order volume was negatively impacted by the Sunday timing of the Valentine's Day holiday, which worsened from the Saturday placement of the holiday in 2015. During 2016, we elected to shift certain group buying placements to the Provide Commerce segment and also reduce the number of partners due to changes in some partners' marketing strategies. Both of these changes had an impact on revenues in these programs for 2016. In addition, revenue was lower for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to $4.1 million of breakage revenue which was recognized in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of our determination, based on a change in circumstances, that there was no longer a requirement to remit to relevant jurisdictions, under unclaimed property laws, the value of certain gift cards and vouchers which are not expected to be redeemed ( breakage\u201d). Breakage revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 was not significant.\nFlorist segment revenues increased $1.1 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Services revenues increased $1.8 million due to a $1.0 million increase in subscription and other services revenues and an $0.8 million increase in order-related revenues. Products revenues decreased $0.7 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of fresh flowers. Average revenues per member increased 7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nPrior to the Acquisition, we reported our business operations in three reportable segments: Consumer, Florist, and International. As a result of the Acquisition, which was completed on December 31, 2014, we began reporting our business in four reportable segments: Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International.\n\nItems Affecting Comparability of Financial Results\nLegal Contingencies\nFLORIST SEGMENT \nConsumer Segment Operating Income\nInternational segment operating income decreased slightly by $0.2 million (increased $1.3 million, or 7%, in constant currency) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues decreased $9.6 million (increased $3.5 million in constant currency) which was offset in part by a decrease in operating expenses of $9.4 million (increased $2.2 million in constant currency). Cost of revenues decreased $7.7 million (increased $1.4 million in constant currency). In constant currency, the increase in cost of revenues related to an increase in average order value as well as costs associated with increased wholesale revenues. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $1.5 million (flat in constant currency) related to lower consumer order volume and closure of the U.K. garden center concession stands in 2014, partially offset by investments related to improving customer service and the customer experience. International segment operating margin was 11% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nConsumer orders. We monitor the number of consumer orders for floral, gift, and related products during a given period. Consumer orders are individual units delivered during the period that originated in the U.S. and Canada, primarily through the www.ftd.com, www.proflowers.com, www.berries.com, and www.personalcreations.com websites, associated mobile sites and applications, the 1-800-SEND-FTD telephone number and various other telephone numbers; and in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland, primarily through the www.interflora.co.uk, www.flyingflowers.co.uk, and www.interflora.ie websites, associated mobile sites and applications, and various telephone numbers. The number of consumer orders is not adjusted for non-delivered orders that are refunded on or after the scheduled delivery date. Orders originating with a florist or other retail location for delivery to consumers are not included as part of this number.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\n (a) The impact of foreign currency reflects the impact of the change in the foreign currency exchange rate from the prior period to the current period. We calculate the impact by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period.  We present certain results from our International segment on a constant currency basis. Constant currency information permits the comparison of results between periods as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. Our International segment operates principally in the U.K. We calculate constant currency by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period.\nProvide Commerce segment revenues decreased $53.6 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by a 9% decrease in consumer order volume combined with a 1% decrease in average order value. The revenue decline was largely due to a 17% decline in the ProFlowers revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The Gourmet Foods business reported a 2% decrease in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Partially offsetting the decrease in revenues, the Personal Creations business reported 8% growth in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015. Both ProFlowers and Gourmet Foods revenues were negatively impacted by the Sunday timing of the Valentine's Day holiday period during 2016, which worsened from the Saturday timing in 2015. ProFlowers was also impacted by an overall decline in revenues due to lower investment in customer acquisition marketing, which reduced order volume during 2016.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nConsolidated Cost of Revenues\nIn calculating the fair value of the reporting units, we used a combination of the market approach and the income approach valuation methodologies. The income approach was used primarily, as we believe that a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. Under the market approach we used the guideline company method, which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select reasonably similar companies based on business description, revenue size, markets served and profitability. The key assumptions used in the income approach discounted cash flow valuation model included discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections, and terminal growth rates. The discount rate utilized is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in a similar business. Considering industry and company specific historical data and internal forecasts and projections, management developed growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. In determining the terminal growth rates, we considered GDP growth, consumer price inflation and the long term growth prospects of each reporting unit. The discount rate, growth rates, royalty rates, cash flow projections and terminal growth rates are also significant estimates used in the determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nThe degree to which our assets are leveraged and the terms of our debt could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital, as well as the terms at which such capital might be offered to us. We currently expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months, including interest payment obligations, quarterly amortization payments, and mandatory prepayments, if any, under the Credit Agreement.\nFlorist Segment Revenues\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a tax benefit of $5.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $88.3 million, compared to a tax benefit of $1.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the impairment of goodwill is not tax deductible, and therefore, there is no tax benefit recorded on the charges. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the effective tax rate increased primarily due to the higher pre-tax loss and lower non-deductible expenses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nConsolidated general and administrative expenses increased $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $37.2 million of general and administrative expenses associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment, excluding depreciation and transaction-related costs. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2015, depreciation expense increased $9.3 million primarily due to assets acquired in the Acquisition. Further, personnel-related costs, excluding those directly related to the Provide Commerce segment, increased $7.9 million, primarily due to increased stock-based compensation. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in transaction-related costs of $5.7 million due to a majority of the transaction costs related to the Acquisition being recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries) were $3.1 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2015, than the year ended December 31, 2014. Consolidated general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was 10% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 12% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThrough our Consumer segment, we are a leading direct marketer of floral and gift products for consumers, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Our Consumer segment operates primarily through the www.ftd.com website, associated mobile sites, and the 1-800-SEND-FTD telephone number. Through our Provide Commerce segment, we are a leading direct marketer of floral and gift products for consumers, including food gifts, personalized gifts, and other gifting products, primarily in the U.S. Our Provide Commerce segment operates primarily through our www.proflowers.com, www.berries.com, www.personalcreations.com, www.proplants.com, and www.gifts.com websites, associated mobile sites and applications, and various telephone numbers. Through our Florist segment, we are a leading provider of products and services to our floral network members, including services that enable our floral network members to send, receive, and deliver floral orders. Floral network members include traditional retail florists, as well as other non-florist retail locations, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Our Florist segment also provides products and services to other companies in need of floral and gifting solutions. Our International segment consists of Interflora, which operates primarily in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. Interflora is a premier direct marketer of floral and non-floral gift products, including bears, chocolates, wine, and tailored food products for consumers and operates primarily through the www.interflora.co.uk, www.flyingflowers.co.uk, www.flowersdirect.co.uk, and www.interflora.ie websites, associated mobile sites and applications, and various telephone numbers. Interflora also provides products and services to floral network members, funeral directors, independent gift shops, other retailers, and to other companies in need of floral and gifting solutions.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of FTD Companies, Inc.'s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (together with FTD Companies, Inc., the U.S. Loan Parties\u201d). In addition, the obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the U.S. Loan Parties, including a pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock of certain direct subsidiaries of the U.S. Loan Parties (except with respect to foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries whose assets consist primarily of foreign subsidiary equity interests, in which case such pledge is limited to 66% of the outstanding capital stock).\nThis MD&A is a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and provides additional information on our business, recent developments, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, cash flows, and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and the other sections of this Form 10-K.\nKEY BUSINESS METRICS\nWe present certain results from our International segment on a constant currency basis. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. Our International segment operates principally in the U.K. We calculate constant currency by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period. In addition, we have excluded intersegment revenues and expenses in the discussion below.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nFlorist segment operating income increased $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as the revenue increase of $3.2 million was largely offset by a $3.1 million increase in operating expenses. Cost of revenues increased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by the increase in sales of fresh flowers offset by declines in services revenues. In addition, sales and marketing expenses were $3.0 million higher, primarily due to $3.4 million of incremental costs associated with increased order-related revenues, which was partially offset by a $0.4 million reduction in personnel-related costs. Florist segment operating margin decreased to 28% for year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 29% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInternational segment revenues decreased $14.2 million, or 9%, (increased $4.5 million, or 3%, in constant currency), for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenues in constant currency was primarily due to an increase in average order value of 3%. Consumer order volume for the year ended December 31, 2016 was relatively consistent with that of the year ended December 31, 2015 as modest growth in everyday order volume was offset by the Sunday placement of the Valentine's Day holiday in 2016 compared to the Saturday placement in 2015.\nFlorist segment revenues increased $3.2 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Products revenues increased $3.2 million primarily due to an increase in sales of fresh flowers and technology systems. Services revenues were flat due to a $2.6 million decrease in subscription and other services revenues, offset by a $2.6 million increase in order-related revenues. Average revenues per member increased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther Commitments\nOn March 8, 2016, our board of directors authorized a new common stock repurchase program (the 2016 Repurchase Program\u201d) that allows us to repurchase up to $60 million of FTD common stock from time to time over a two-year period in both open market and privately negotiated transactions. At December 31, 2016, the Company had repurchased 0.6 million shares under the 2016 Repurchase Program at an average cost of $25.37. The Company has $44.8 million of availability under this program for future repurchases. The objective of the 2016 Repurchase Program is to offset the dilutive effect on earnings per share from stock-based compensation and allow for opportunistic stock purchases to return capital to shareholders.\nConsumer segment operating income decreased $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the decrease in revenues of $30.1 million, as previously described, partially offset by a $23.5 million decrease in operating expenses. Operating expenses were lower primarily due to a decrease in cost of revenues of $17.4 million, which was driven by reduced spending associated with lower order volume. Other operating expenses decreased $6.2 million primarily due to reduced spending associated with lower order volume, lower fixed costs in the customer service area, and lower technology and development costs. In addition, segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was lower compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the breakage adjustment. The consumer segment operating margin decreased to 10% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInternational Segment Revenues\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nFlorist Segment Operating Income\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management's estimate of their fair value. We account for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles, Goodwill and Other. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are reviewed for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would indicate it is more likely than not that the goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. Testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit excluding goodwill is compared to the net assets including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nThe determination of whether or not goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired involves a significant level of judgment and estimates in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe our analysis included sufficient tolerance for sensitivity in key assumptions. We believe the assumptions and rates used in our impairment assessments are reasonable, but they are judgmental, and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (1) forecasted order volumes and average order values, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics, and changes in consumer preferences; (2) marketing costs to generate orders; (3) product and fulfillment costs; (4) operational efficiency; and (5) equity valuations of peer companies.\n \nIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, sureties and insurance companies, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. We have entered into indemnification agreements with our current and former directors and certain of our officers and employees that require FTD, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. In addition, we have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers, directors, and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may, in certain circumstances, cover specified liabilities, including those arising from our obligation to indemnify our current and former directors, certain of our officers and employees, and certain former officers, directors, and employees of acquired companies.\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In accordance with ASC 740, we recognize, in our consolidated financial statements, the impact of our tax positions that are more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions. We recognize interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nAcquisitions\nSegment operating income. Our chief operating decision maker uses segment operating income to evaluate the performance of our business segments and to make decisions about allocating resources among segments. Segment operating income is operating income excluding depreciation, amortization, litigation and dispute settlement charges and gains, transaction-related costs, restructuring and other exit costs, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Stock-based compensation and general corporate expenses are not allocated to the segments. Segment operating income is prior to intersegment eliminations and excludes other income (expense), net. See Note 3- Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated operating income and consolidated income before income taxes.\nInterest expense was consistent for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The savings related to the lower level of debt principal balances were offset by slightly higher interest rates and amortization of the interest rate cap.\nWe currently expect to generate positive cash flows from operations at least for the next twelve months. We may use our existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund, among other things, working capital, stock repurchases, interest payment obligations, quarterly amortization payments and mandatory prepayments, if any, under the Credit Agreement, capital expenditures, and acquisitions.\nProbability of collection is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If it is determined that collectability is not reasonably assured, revenues are not recognized until collectability becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.\nNet cash used for investing activities decreased by $85.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to a $96.7 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, as the acquisition of Provide Commerce was completed in the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\nUNALLOCATED EXPENSES\nConsumer Segment Revenues\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFlorist Segment Operating Income\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nWe elected to perform the one-step quantitative impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets under ASC 350. Under the one-step quantitative impairment test, the fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are compared to their respective carrying amounts and, if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. The annual quantitative indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test resulted in the determination that the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts. Accordingly, we did not record any impairment charges related to our indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2016. Certain key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets were discount rates of 10.5% to 11% and average royalty rates of 2.5% to 3.7%.\nConsolidated sales and marketing expenses increased $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $136.0 million of sales and marketing expenses associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment and an increase of $3.0 million in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Florist segment. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $1.5 million (increase $0.1 million in constant currency) and $0.4 million in sales and marketing expenses associated with our International and Consumer segments, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $1.6 million favorable impact on sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 17% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nConsolidated cost of revenues increased $363.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated cost of revenues was primarily due to $368.4 million of costs associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment and a $0.2 million increase in costs associated with our Florist segment, offset by a $7.7 million decrease (increase $1.3 in constant currency) in costs associated with our International segment and a $2.1 million decrease in costs associated with our Consumer segment. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $9.0 million favorable impact on cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, depreciation expense increased $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Consolidated cost of revenues, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, remained consistent at 63% for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, our consolidated revenues, segment revenues, segment operating income, consumer orders, average order values, average revenues per member, and average currency exchange rates. Since the acquisition of Provide Commerce was completed on December 31, 2014, no results of operations were included for this segment for the year ended December 31 2014. \nInterest Expense, Net\nProvide Commerce Segment Revenues\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $85.0 million related to the Provide Commerce segment.\nFor information about recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to Note 1- Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, Accounting Policies, and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAs a result of the impairment of the ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods' goodwill, we assessed if there was any impairment of intangible or other long-term assets within the ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods' reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired.\nOVERVIEW\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nConsolidated Sales and Marketing\nIf we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could severely constrain or prevent us from, among other factors, developing new or enhancing existing services or products, acquiring other services, businesses, or technologies, or funding significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as impair our ability to service our debt obligations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage of stock owned by the then-current stockholders could be reduced. Furthermore, such equity or any debt securities that we issue might have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to holders of our common stock. In addition, trends in the securities and credit markets may restrict our ability to raise any such additional funds, at least in the near term.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $11.8 million, primarily related to senior management changes, including expenses for severance and related accelerated vesting of equity awards. In addition, we incurred restructuring charges related to the consolidation of certain office and distribution facilities for the Provide Commerce segment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $6.1 million, primarily related to the closure of the Provide Commerce developing businesses and certain distribution and call center locations.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS\nWe review a number of key business metrics to help us monitor our performance and trends affecting our segments and to develop forecasts and budgets. These key metrics include the following:\n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nConsolidated revenues increased $579.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily due to $583.3 million of revenues associated with the addition of our Provide Commerce segment, a $3.1 million increase in revenues from our Consumer segment, and a $3.2 million increase in revenues from our Florist segment, partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease ($3.5 million increase in constant currency) in revenues from our International segment. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenues by $13.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.1 million on pre-tax loss of $81.3 million, compared to a tax provision of $9.5 million on pre-tax income of $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the impairment of goodwill is not tax deductible, and therefore, there is no tax benefit recorded on the charge. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to book losses in the U.S. resulting from the goodwill impairment and the amortization of the intangibles acquired in the Acquisition.\nNet cash used for financing activities decreased by $54.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the repurchase of 0.6 million shares of common stock totaling $15.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $50.0 million of repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, repayments of $20.0 million of outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2016 were lower than net repayments of $40.0 million during 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also repurchased $2.3 million of our common stock related to withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units. We withhold shares to cover withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units and pay these taxes in cash. Proceeds of $2.2 million were received from the sale of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.\nConsumer Segment Revenues\n (a) Interest obligations were estimated using implied forward interest rates for 3-month LIBOR based on quoted market rates from the U.S. dollar-denominated interest-rate swap curve.  At December 31, 2016, we had liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $0.4 million, none of which is included in the table above, as we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments for long-term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions will occur.\nUnallocated expenses increased $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $11.8 million, primarily associated with senior management changes and related accelerated vesting of equity awards and the closure and consolidation of certain locations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred restructuring costs of $6.1 million related to the closure of certain Provide Commerce developing businesses and locations. Litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries) increased $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Partially offsetting these increases was a $3.0 million decrease in transaction-related costs and a decrease in personnel-related costs of $0.3 million.\nConsolidated revenues decreased $96.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenues was primarily due to a decrease of $53.6 million in revenues from our Provide Commerce segment, a $30.1 million decrease in revenues from our Consumer segment, and a $14.2 million decrease in revenues from our International segment (increase of $4.5 million in constant currency). Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenues by $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral\nConsolidated cost of revenues decreased $63.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated cost of revenues was primarily due a decrease of $33.4 million in costs associated with our Provide Commerce segment, a decrease of $17.4 million in costs associated with our Consumer segment, and a decrease of $10.1 million (increase of $2.8 million in constant currency) in costs associated with our International segment. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $12.8 million favorable impact on cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consolidated cost of revenues, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, remained constant at 63% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the fair value of each of the Consumer, Florist, International, and Personal Creations reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values. Therefore, each of these reporting units passed step one of the goodwill impairment test and their goodwill was not determined to be impaired. The ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods reporting unit, a significant portion of the Provide Commerce reporting segment, failed step one of the goodwill impairment test and, based on the second step of the assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $84.0 million related to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 6- Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nProducts revenues, less discounts and refunds, and the related cost of revenues are recognized when products are delivered to the customers. Shipping and service fees charged to customers are recognized at the time the related products revenues are recognized and are included in products revenues. Shipping and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues. Our consumer businesses generally recognize revenues on a gross basis because we bear the risks and rewards associated with the revenue-generating activities by (i) acting as a principal in the transaction; (ii) establishing prices; (iii) being responsible for fulfillment of the order by the floral network members and third-party suppliers; (iv) taking the risk of loss for collection, delivery and returns; and (v) marketing the products and services.\nThe Company incurs certain expenses which are not allocated to its four reportable segments.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nInternational Segment Operating Income\nThe term loan is subject to amortization payments of $5 million per quarter and customary mandatory prepayments under certain conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company made scheduled payments of $20 million under the term loan. The outstanding balance of the term loan and all amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due upon maturity in September 2019. At December 31, 2016, the remaining borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement, which was reduced by $2.4 million in outstanding letters of credit, was $227.6 million.\nOur ability to repurchase our common stock may be limited under our Investor Rights Agreement with Liberty, which provides that Liberty's ownership in the Company is capped at 40.0% of our common stock outstanding beginning January 1, 2017, subject to certain exceptions, including with respect to third-party tender offers. Liberty's ownership in FTD was 37.4% at December 31, 2016.\nAs a result of the Acquisition, our operating and reportable segments changed to include a fourth segment, Provide Commerce. Accordingly, beginning December 31, 2014, our operating and reportable segments consist of Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International. However, as the Acquisition was completed on December 31, 2014, no results of operations of Provide Commerce were included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. For additional information about our reportable segments refer to MD&A and Note 3- Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Sales and Marketing\nFlorist segment operating income increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the revenue increase of $1.1 million and a $1.6 million decrease in the cost of revenues. The cost of revenues decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in sales of fresh flowers and continued cost efficiencies realized across the business. General and administrative expenses increased $1.6 million driven largely by an increase in bad debt expense primarily related to one member and was partially offset by lower personnel costs. Florist segment operating margin increased to 29% for year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 28% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe have revised the previously reported consolidated financial statements and related metrics for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 for certain errors that were not material in any of the years revised. See Note 17-Immaterial Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements in the Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\n (a) Segment revenues are prior to intersegment eliminations. See Note 3- Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment revenues to consolidated revenues. \nFor additional information about our reportable segments refer to Note 3- Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, selected historical consolidated statements of operations data. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions,\u201d Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d and Contractual Obligations, Other Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,\u201d included in this Item 7, and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \nOn February 27, 2014, our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program (the 2014 Repurchase Program\u201d) that allows us to repurchase up to $50 million of FTD common stock from time to time over a two-year period in both open market and privately negotiated transactions. No purchases were made under the 2014 Repurchase Program prior to 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had repurchased 1.8 million shares under the 2014 Repurchase Program at an average cost per share of $27.31, fully utilizing the $50 million authorization.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $5.4 million. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income/(loss) adjusted for non-cash items including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, deferred taxes, stock-based compensation, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was due to a higher net loss of $3.0 million, a decrease of $11.0 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments to vendors and lower accrued compensation during 2016, a $6.2 million decrease in accounts receivable, net, and a decrease of $4.4 million in non-cash items. The change in non-cash items was primarily related to decreases in deferred tax assets, gains on life insurance contracts, goodwill impairment, and depreciation and amortization, which were partially offset by increases in stock-based compensation due to accelerated vesting from senior management changes and the provision for doubtful accounts receivable. The decreases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $10.8 million increase in income taxes receivable and a $7.3 million increase in other liabilities. Changes in working capital can cause variation in our cash flows provided by operating activities due to seasonality, timing, and other factors.\nPROVIDE COMMERCE SEGMENT\nInterest expense increased $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increases were due to higher debt principal balances outstanding, associated with the incremental borrowing for the Acquisition, as well as higher interest rates and increased amortization of both the interest rate cap and deferred financing fees.\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business or a group of businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management. An operating segment is made up of one or more reporting units. The Company reports its business operations in four operating and reportable segments: Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International. Each of the Consumer, Florist, and International segments is a reporting unit. The Provide Commerce segment is comprised of two reporting units, ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods and Personal Creations. ProFlowers and Gourmet Foods businesses have similar margins and share operations and business team structure, among other similarities. Therefore these businesses meet the aggregation criteria, and as such, we have aggregated these two businesses into one reporting unit. We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment for these five reporting units. We elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nContractual Obligations\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nOn September 19, 2014, FTD Companies, Inc. entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Interflora British Unit, certain wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of FTD Companies, Inc. party thereto as guarantors, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint lead arrangers and book managers, and Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent for the lenders, which provided for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of outstanding revolving loans and also provided for a revolving loan advance (the Acquisition Advance\u201d) to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition purchase price. On December 31, 2014, we borrowed $120 million under the Acquisition Advance to fund the cash portion of the Acquisition purchase price.\nAt December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nAverage order value. We monitor the average value for consumer orders delivered in a given period, which we refer to as the average order value. Average order value represents the average amount received for consumer orders delivered during a period. The average order value of consumer orders within our Consumer, Provide Commerce, and International segments is tracked in their local currency, the U.S. Dollar ( USD\u201d) for both the Consumer and Provide Commerce segments and the British Pound ( GBP\u201d) for the International segment. The local currency amounts received for the International segment are then translated into USD at the average currency exchange rate for the period. Average order value includes merchandise revenues and shipping or service fees paid by the consumer less discounts and refunds (net of refund-related fees charged to floral network members).\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nInterest Expense, Net\nReportable Segments\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the intangible assets acquired in the Acquisition.\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and investigations. The Company records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates at least quarterly, developments in its legal matters that could affect the assessment of the probability of loss or the amount of liability, and makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company may be unable to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss due to various reasons, including, among others: (i) if the damages sought are indeterminate, (ii) if the proceedings are in early stages, (iii) if there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals, motions or settlements, (iv) if there are significant factual issues to be determined or resolved, and (v) if there are novel or unsettled legal theories presented. In such instances, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss, if any. We continually assess the potential liability related to such pending matters. Legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control. As such, there can be no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFlorist Segment Revenues\nAcquisition of Provide Commerce\nServices revenues related to orders sent through the floral network are variable based on either the number of orders or on the value of orders and are recognized in the period in which the orders are delivered. Membership and other subscription-based fees are recognized monthly as earned, on a month-to-month basis.\nPrior to the Acquisition, the Company reported its business operations in three reportable segments: Consumer, Florist, and International. As a result of the Acquisition, the Company began reporting its business in four reportable segments: Consumer, Provide Commerce, Florist, and International. Segment operating income is operating income excluding depreciation, amortization, litigation and dispute settlement charges or gains, transaction-related costs, restructuring and other exit costs, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Stock-based compensation and general corporate expenses are not allocated to the segments. Segment operating income is prior to intersegment eliminations and excludes other income, net.\nInternational segment revenues decreased $9.6 million, or 5%, (increased $3.5 million, or 2%, in constant currency), for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenues in constant currency was primarily due to an increase in average order value of 2%. In addition, revenues increased in Interflora's florist business, driven by sales of wholesale products and increases in member fee revenues. Consumer order volume decreased 1%, primarily related to declines in the Valentine's Day and U.K. Mother's Day holiday periods, offset in part by overall growth in order volume outside of these holiday periods. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Saturday placement of the Valentine's Day holiday had a negative impact on revenues as expected.\nOn December 31, 2014, we acquired from a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive Corporation ( Liberty\u201d) all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Provide Commerce, Inc. ( Provide Commerce\u201d), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty, for a purchase price consisting of (i) cash consideration of $106.6 million, excluding acquired cash on hand of $38.1 million and a post-closing working capital adjustment of $9.9 million, and (ii) 10.2 million shares of FTD common stock (the Acquisition\u201d). At the closing of the Acquisition, these shares represented approximately 35% of the issued and outstanding shares of FTD common stock. In April 2015, FTD made a payment to Liberty in full satisfaction of the post-closing working capital adjustment. Upon the closing of the Acquisition, Provide Commerce became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FTD.\nConsumer segment operating income increased $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as revenue increased $3.1 million, as previously described, coupled with a $2.4 million decrease in operating expenses. Operating expenses were lower primarily due to decreases in cost of revenues of $2.1 million. The decrease in costs of revenues was driven by lower consumer orders as well as product and shipping cost savings. Further, segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 improved due to the breakage adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015 as noted above. The consumer segment operating margin increased to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 10% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe results of operations for Provide Commerce for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are presented below. The Acquisition was completed as of December 31, 2014. Therefore, no results for the year ended December 31, 2014 are included in our analysis. \nIncome Taxes\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.\nConsolidated General and Administrative\nNet cash used for financing activities was $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $114.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in net cash used for/provided by financing activities was primarily due to net repayments of $40.0 million of outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, we paid $50.0 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares of our common stock under the 2014 Repurchase Program and $2.6 million related to withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2015. Proceeds of $1.6 million were received from the sale of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. During the year ended December 31, 2014, under the Credit Agreement, we entered into a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of outstanding revolving loans. In addition, we borrowed $120 million under the Acquisition Advance, as provided for in the Credit Agreement, to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition purchase price. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid $3.9 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Agreement as well as $2.4 million related to withholding taxes on vested restricted stock units.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $34.9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was due to a $101.7 million decrease in net income and a $10.8 million change in operating assets and liabilities which was more than offset by an increase of $147.4 million in non-cash items, primarily related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and depreciation and amortization. Changes in working capital can cause variation in our cash flows provided by operating activities due to seasonality, timing, and other factors.\nConsolidated general and administrative expenses decreased $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in consolidated general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs of $6.5 million, which included a decrease in headcount, incentive compensation expense, and stock-based compensation. In addition, transaction-related costs also decreased $2.9 million, facility costs decreased $1.0 million, and technology costs decreased $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Legal costs, including litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries), also decreased $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These decreases were partially offset by increases in bad debt expense of $1.8 million and depreciation expense of $0.6 million. Consolidated general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, was stable at 10% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $84.0 million related to the Provide Commerce segment compared to a goodwill impairment charge of $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nUnallocated expenses increased $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $6.1 million, primarily associated with the closure of certain Provide Commerce developing businesses and locations. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $0.2 million of restructuring costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, personnel-related costs increased $8.8 million, primarily due to stock-based compensation increases of $5.6 million. In addition, costs related to audit and other professional fees and insurance increased $2.1 million. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in transaction-related costs of $5.7 million and in litigation and dispute settlement charges (net of insurance recoveries) of $3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe segment results included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 3-Segment Information to the Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is also presented on this basis.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $6.1 million, primarily related to the closure of the Provide Commerce developing businesses certain distribution and call center locations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred restructuring and other exit costs of $0.2 million, primarily related to the closure of various U.K. garden center concession stands.\nConsolidated Revenues\nWe had $2.4 million of commitments under letters of credit at December 31, 2016 which were scheduled to expire within one year. Standby letters of credit are maintained by FTD to secure credit card processing activity and additional letters of credit are maintained related to inventory purchases, insurance policies and lease obligations.\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $23.1 million to $81.0 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $57.9 million at December 31, 2015. Our summary cash flows for the periods presented were as follows (in thousands): \nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions that affect a number of reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following accounting policies, and estimates and assumptions made by management thereunder, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates and assumptions require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment and may be based on matters the effects of which are inherently uncertain.\nUnallocated expenses include various corporate costs, such as executive management, corporate finance, legal, and certain human resources costs. In addition, unallocated expenses include stock-based compensation for all eligible Company employees, restructuring and other exit costs, transaction-related costs, and litigation and dispute settlement charges and gains.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the asset group to be tested for recoverability. We are also required to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, and remaining economic lives of assets.\nCertain key assumptions used in determining the fair value for the Company's reporting units were as follows: \nConsolidated Revenues\nContractual obligations at December 31, 2016 were as follows (in thousands): \nAverage revenues per member. We monitor average revenues per member for our floral network members in the Florist segment. Average revenues per member represents the average revenues earned from a member of our floral network during a period. Revenues include services revenues and products revenues but exclude revenues from sales to non-members. Floral network members include our retail florists and other non-florist retail locations who offer floral and gifting solutions. Average revenues per member is calculated by dividing Florist segment revenues for the period, excluding sales to non-members, by the average number of floral network members for the period.\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS\nCredit Agreement\nConsumer segment revenues slightly increased $3.1 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The Consumer segment recognized breakage revenue of $4.1 million during the third quarter of 2015 as noted above. Segment revenues improved as average order value increased 2% primarily driven by consumers selecting higher value offerings, our sympathy business, which typically carries higher average order values, and other merchandising improvements. Revenue increases were partially offset by the consumer order volume decrease of 2%, primarily related to declines during the Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and Christmas holiday periods. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Saturday placement of the Valentine's Day holiday had a negative impact on revenues.\nThe interest rates applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement are based on either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% per annum to 2.50% per annum, or a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% per annum to 1.50% per annum, calculated according to the Company's net leverage ratio. At December 31, 2016, the base rate margin was 0.75% per annum and the LIBOR margin was 1.75% per annum. In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% per annum to 0.40% per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The stated interest rates (based on LIBOR) at December 31, 2016 under the term loan and the revolving credit facility were 2.75% and 2.52%, respectively. The effective interest rates at December 31, 2016 under the term loan and the revolving credit facility were 3.46% and 3.06%, respectively. The commitment fee rate at December 31, 2016 was 0.25%. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, affirmative covenants, and negative covenants, that, among other things, require the Company to maintain compliance with a maximum net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and impose restrictions and limitations on, among other things, investments, dividends, share repurchases, and asset sales, and the Company's ability to incur additional debt and additional liens. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2016.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nConsolidated Cost of Revenues\nCONSUMER SEGMENT \nConsumer Segment Operating Income\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nProvide Commerce Segment Operating Income\nInternational Segment Revenues\n \nFTD Companies, Inc.

Florist, and International. The Provide Commerce segment was added after the acquisition of Provide Commerce in 2014. \n\n- In 2016, consolidated revenues decreased by $96.3 million compared to 2015, primarily due to decreases in the Provide Commerce, Consumer, and International segments. This was partially offset by a slight increase in the Florist segment.\n\n- Net loss in 2016 was $83.2 million compared to a net loss of $80.1 million in 2015. The increased loss was primarily due to lower revenues and a goodwill impairment charge of $84 million related to the ProFlowers/Gourmet Foods reporting unit. \n\n- In 2016, the Company incurred restructuring costs of $11.8 million related to senior management changes and consolidation of facilities. Additional costs included accelerated vesting of equity awards.\n\n- Operating cash flows decreased by $5.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower net income and changes in working capital.\n\n- In 2016, the Company repurchased $15.2 million of common stock under its share repurchase program, compared to $50 million in 2015. Debt repayments were also lower in 2016.\n\n- Goodwill impairment charges of $84 million and $85 million were recorded in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the Provide Commerce segment. \n\n- The report provides details on revenues, operating income, and metrics for each of the four business segments."}
