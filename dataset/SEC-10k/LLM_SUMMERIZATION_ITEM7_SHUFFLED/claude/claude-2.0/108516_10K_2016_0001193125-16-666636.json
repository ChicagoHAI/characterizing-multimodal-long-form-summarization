Such forward-looking statements are based, in whole or in part, on management's beliefs, estimates, assumptions and currently available information. For a more detailed discussion of what constitutes a forward-looking statement and of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, please refer to the \u201cSafe Harbor Statement\u201d in the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and \u201cPart I - Item 1A. - Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntroduction\nWorthington Industries, Inc. is a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Ohio (individually, the \u201cRegistrant\u201d or \u201cWorthington Industries\u201d or, collectively with the subsidiaries of Worthington Industries, Inc., \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cWorthington\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). Founded in 1955, Worthington is primarily a diversified metals manufacturing company, focused on value-added steel processing and manufactured metal products. Our manufactured metal products include: pressure cylinders for liquefied petroleum gas (\u201cLPG\u201d), compressed natural gas (\u201cCNG\u201d), oxygen, refrigerant and other industrial gas storage; hand torches and filled hand torch cylinders; propane-filled camping cylinders; helium-filled balloon kits; steel and fiberglass tanks and processing equipment primarily for the oil and gas industry; cryogenic pressure vessels for liquefied natural gas (\u201cLNG\u201d) and other gas storage applications; engineered cabs and operator stations and cab components; and, through joint ventures, suspension grid systems for concealed and lay-in panel ceilings; laser welded blanks; light gauge steel framing for commercial and residential construction; and current and past model automotive service stampings. Our number one goal is to increase shareholder value, which we seek to accomplish by optimizing existing operations, developing and commercializing new products and applications, and pursuing strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.\nAs of May 31, 2016, excluding our joint ventures, we operated 31 manufacturing facilities worldwide, principally in three operating segments, which correspond with our reportable business segments: Steel Processing, Pressure Cylinders and Engineered Cabs. Our remaining operating segments, which do not meet the applicable aggregation criteria or quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure, are combined and reported in the \u201cOther\u201d category. These include Construction Services and Worthington Energy Innovations (\u201cWEI\u201d). The Company is in the process of exiting the businesses within Construction Services.\nWe also held equity positions in 12 active joint ventures, which operated 51 manufacturing facilities worldwide, as of May 31, 2016. Six of these joint ventures are consolidated with the equity owned by the other joint venture member(s) shown as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets, and the other joint venture member(s)' portion of net earnings and other comprehensive income shown as net earnings or comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, respectively. The remaining six of these joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\nOverview\nPerformance was steady during fiscal 2016 despite challenging market conditions resulting from lower average steel and oil prices. A higher spread between average selling prices and material cost and improved operations in the industrial and consumer products businesses in Pressure Cylinders helped to offset the impact of inventory holding losses in Steel Processing and lower volume in the Oil & Gas Equipment business within Pressure Cylinders. Demand remained steady in most of our key end markets, with the exception of the oil and gas equipment and agricultural end markets.\nEquity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates (\u201cequity income\u201d) was up 31% in fiscal 2016 to $115.0 million on higher contributions from all of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Strong automotive and construction markets and lower steel costs have benefited these businesses. We received distributions of $86.5 million from our unconsolidated affiliates during fiscal 2016.\nRecent Business Developments\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> On December 7, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the global CryoScience business of Taylor Wharton, including a manufacturing facility in Theodore, Alabama, for $30.6 million.

As a result, WSP's results have been consolidated within the financial results of Steel Processing since that date, with the minority member's portion of earnings eliminated within earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest. In the periods prior to March 1, 2016, WSP's results had been accounted for under the equity method. As required by the applicable accounting guidance, a pre-tax gain of $6.9 million was recognized for the difference between the fair value of the Company's previously-held ownership interest in WSP and its carrying value at the acquisition date. The gain was recorded in miscellaneous income, below operating income. The ownership percentages in WSP remained unchanged at 51% Worthington and 49% U.S. Steel.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> On June 29, 2016, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, an increase of $0.01 per share from the previous quarterly rate.

The breakdown of our net sales by end market for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 is illustrated in the following chart:\nThe automotive industry is one of the largest consumers of flat-rolled steel, and thus the largest end market for our Steel Processing operating segment. Approximately 65% of the net sales of our Steel Processing operating segment are to the automotive market. North American vehicle production, primarily by FCA US, Ford and General Motors (the \u201cDetroit Three automakers\u201d), has a considerable impact on the activity within this operating segment. The majority of the net sales of three of our unconsolidated joint ventures are also to the automotive end market.\nApproximately 10% of the net sales of our Steel Processing operating segment, 52% of the net sales of our Engineered Cabs operating segment and substantially all of the net sales of our Construction Services operating segment are to the construction market. The construction market is also the predominant end market for two of our unconsolidated joint ventures: WAVE and ClarkDietrich. While the market price of steel significantly impacts these businesses, there are other key indicators that are meaningful in analyzing construction market demand, including U.S. gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d), the Dodge Index of construction contracts and, in the case of ClarkDietrich, trends in the relative price of framing lumber and steel.\nSubstantially all of the net sales of our Pressure Cylinders operating segment, and approximately 25% and 48% of the net sales of our Steel Processing and Engineered Cabs operating segments, respectively, are to other markets such as consumer products, industrial, lawn and garden, agriculture, oil and gas equipment, heavy truck, mining, forestry and appliance. Given the many different products that make up these net sales and the wide variety of end markets, it is very difficult to detail the key market indicators that drive this portion of our business. However, we believe that the trend in U.S. GDP growth is a good economic indicator for analyzing these operating segments.\nWe use the following information to monitor our costs and demand in our major end markets:\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 vs.\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 vs.\n2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. GDP (% growth year-over-year)1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-1.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hot-Rolled Steel ($ per ton)2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>149 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>60 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Detroit Three Auto Build (000's vehicles)3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> No. America Auto Build (000's vehicles)3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>731 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Zinc ($ per pound)4\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural Gas ($ per mcf)5\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.08 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>1.32 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>0.48 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> On-Highway Diesel Fuel Prices ($ per gallon)6\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>0.98 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>0.53 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Crude Oil - WTI ($ per barrel)6\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73.16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>30.49 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>27.33 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 2015/2014 figures based on revised actuals 2 CRU Hot-Rolled Index; period average 3 IHS Global 4 LME Zinc; period average 5 NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas; period average 6 Energy Information Administration; period average\nU.S. GDP growth rate trends are generally indicative of the strength in demand and, in many cases, pricing for our products. A year-over-year increase in U.S. GDP growth rates is indicative of a stronger economy, which generally increases demand and pricing for our products. Conversely, decreasing U.S. GDP growth rates generally indicate a weaker economy. Changes in U.S. GDP growth rates can also signal changes in conversion costs related to production and in selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expense.\nThe market price of hot-rolled steel is one of the most significant factors impacting our selling prices and operating results. When steel prices fall, we typically have higher-priced material flowing through cost of goods sold, while selling prices compress to what the market will bear, negatively impacting our results. On the other hand, in a rising price environment, our results are generally favorably impacted, as lower-priced material purchased in previous periods flows through cost of goods sold, while our selling prices increase at a faster pace to cover current replacement costs.\nThe following table presents the average quarterly market price per ton of hot-rolled steel during fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014:\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars per ton 1) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1st Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>627 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2nd Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>651 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3rd Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>669 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4th Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>655 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annual Avg.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>651 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 CRU Hot-Rolled Index\nNo single customer contributed more than 10% of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2016. While our automotive business is largely driven by the production schedules of the Detroit Three automakers, our customer base is much broader and includes other domestic manufacturers and many of their suppliers. During fiscal 2016, vehicle production for the Detroit Three automakers was up 3%. North American vehicle production as a whole also increased 3%.\nCertain other commodities, such as zinc, natural gas and diesel fuel, represent a significant portion of our cost of goods sold, both directly through our plant operations and indirectly through transportation and freight expense.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nConsolidated Operations\nThe following

These resources include cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and unused lines of credit. We also believe we have adequate access to the financial markets to allow us to be in a position to sell long-term debt or equity securities. However, uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets may impact our ability to access capital and the terms under which we can do so.\nOperating activities\nOur business is cyclical and cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate during the year and from year to year due to economic and industry conditions. We rely on cash and short-term borrowings to meet cyclical increases in working capital needs. These needs generally rise during periods of increased economic activity or increasing raw material prices due to higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable. During economic slowdowns, or periods of decreasing raw material costs, working capital needs generally decrease as a result of the reduction of inventories and accounts receivable.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $413.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $214.4 million in fiscal 2015. The $198.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by declining working capital levels as a result of lower average steel prices and higher earnings.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used by investing activities was $127.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $203.1 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease of $76.1 million was driven primarily by lower acquisition activity in the current year. During fiscal 2016, we spent a combined $34.2 million, net of cash acquired, for the net assets of the CryoScience business of Taylor Wharton and the net assets of NetBraze, LLC. Comparatively, during fiscal 2015, we spent a combined $105.3 million, net of cash acquired, for the net assets of Rome Strip Steel, Midstream Equipment Fabrication, LLC and James Russell Engineering Works, Inc. and our 79.59% interest in dHybrid Systems, LLC. We also made capital expenditures of $97.0 million and received $9.8 million in proceeds from asset sales during fiscal 2016.\nCapital expenditures reflect cash used for investment in property, plant and equipment and are presented below by reportable business segment (this information excludes cash flows related to acquisition and divestiture activity):\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nMay 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Steel Processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pressure Cylinders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Engineered Cabs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Capital Expenditures\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Capital expenditures were $97.0 million in fiscal 2016. Significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 included $19.4 million to expand capacity at TWB, our consolidated laser blanking joint venture, and $10.6 million of costs associated with the renovation of the Company's corporate headquarters, which was purchased in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 also included $4.1 million of capital outlays associated with the construction of a new cryogenics manufacturing facility in Turkey.\nInvestment activities are largely discretionary and future investment activities could be reduced significantly or eliminated as economic conditions warrant. We assess acquisition opportunities as they arise, and such opportunities may require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that any such opportunities will arise, that any such acquisitions will be consummated or that any needed additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when required.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used by financing activities was $233.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $170.3 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2016, we paid $99.8 million to repurchase 3,500,000 of our common shares, reduced short-term borrowings by $85.8 million, and paid dividends of $47.2 million on our common shares.\nLong-term debt - Our senior unsecured long-term debt is rated \u201cinvestment grade\u201d by both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. We typically use the net proceeds from long-term debt for acquisitions, refinancing of outstanding debt, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. As of May 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our long-term financial debt covenants. Our long-term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions.\nOn September 26, 2014, our consolidated joint venture in Turkey, Worthington Aritas, executed a five-year term loan denominated in Euros. As of May 31, 2016, we had borrowed $28.4 million against the facility. The facility bears interest at a variable rate based on EURIBOR. The applicable variable rate was 1.500% at May 31, 2016. On October 15, 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on 60% of the borrowings outstanding under this facility at 2.015% starting on December 26, 2014 through September 26, 2019. Borrowings against the facility are being used for the construction of a new cryogenics manufacturing facility in Turkey.\nShort-term borrowings - Our short-term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions. We were in compliance with our short-term financial debt covenants at May 31, 2016.\nShort-term borrowings at May 31, 2016, consisted of an aggregate of $2.6 million outstanding under various credit facilities maintained by our consolidated joint venture, Worthington Aritas.\nWe maintain a $500.0 million multi-year revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with a group of lenders that matures in April 2020. Borrowings under the Credit Facility typically have maturities of less than one year and given that our intention has been to repay them within a year, they have been classified as short-term borrowings within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. However, we can also extend the term of amounts borrowed by renewing these borrowings for the term of the Credit Facility. We have the option to borrow at rates equal to an applicable margin over the LIBOR, Prime or Fed Funds rates. The applicable margin is determined by our credit rating. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at May 31, 2016.\nWe maintain a $100.0 million revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility (the \u201cAR Facility\u201d) that expires in January 2018 and was available throughout fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the AR Facility, certain of our subsidiaries sell their accounts receivable without recourse, on a revolving basis, to Worthington Receivables Corporation (\u201cWRC\u201d), a wholly-owned, consolidated, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary. In turn, WRC may sell without recourse, on a revolving basis, up to $100.0 million of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multi-seller, asset-backed commercial paper conduit (the \u201cConduit\u201d). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of A1/P1 commercial paper. We retain an undivided interest in this pool and are subject to risk of loss based on the collectability of the receivables from this retained interest. Because the amount eligible to be sold excludes receivables more than 90 days past due, receivables offset by an allowance for doubtful accounts due to bankruptcy or other cause, concentrations over certain limits with specific customers and certain reserve amounts, we believe additional risk of loss is minimal. The book value of the retained portion of the pool of accounts receivable approximates fair value. As of May 31, 2016, no undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable had been sold.\nWe also had letters of credit totaling $16.4 million outstanding as of May 31, 2016. These letters of credit have been issued to third-party service providers and had no amounts drawn against them at May 31, 2016.\nCommon shares - We declared dividends at a quarterly rate of $0.19 per common share for each quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $0.18 per common share for each quarter of fiscal 2015. Dividends paid on our common shares totaled $47.2 million and $46.4 million, respectively, during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.\nOn June 29, 2011, the Board of Worthington Industries, Inc. authorized the repurchase of up to 10,000,000 of our outstanding common shares of which none remained available for repurchase at May 31, 2016. During fiscal 2015, 1,722,332 common shares were repurchased under this authorization.\nOn June 25, 2014, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10,000,000 of our outstanding common shares. An aggregate of 3,500,000 and 2,453,855 common shares were repurchased under this authorization during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. At May 31, 2016, 4,046,145 common shares remained available for repurchase under this authorization.\nThe common shares available for repurchase under the current authorization may be purchased from time to time, with consideration given to the market price of the common shares, the nature of other investment opportunities, cash flows from operations, general economic conditions and other relevant considerations. Repurchases may be made on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.\nDividend Policy\nWe currently have no material contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. Dividends are declared at the discretion of the Board. The Board reviews the dividend quarterly and establishes the dividend rate based upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, current and projected cash flows, business prospects and other relevant factors. While we have paid a dividend every quarter since becoming a public company in 1968, there is no guarantee that payments will continue in the future.\nContractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of May 31, 2016. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2-3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>581.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>208.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Royalty obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>846.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>485.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Interest expense on long-term debt is computed by using the fixed rates of interest on the debt, including impacts of the related interest rate hedge. Royalty obligations relate to a trademark license agreement executed in connection with the acquisition of Coleman Cylinders in fiscal 2012. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits of $2.8 million, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the periods of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities and have not included this amount in the contractual cash obligations table above.\nThe following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of May 31, 2016. These commercial commitments are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet.\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Commitment Expiration by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2-3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Guarantees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total commercial commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. However, as of May 31, 2016, we were party to an operating lease for an aircraft in which we have guaranteed a residual value at the termination of the lease. The maximum obligation under the terms of this guarantee was approximately $10.5 million at May 31, 2016. Based on current facts and circumstances, we have estimated the likelihood of payment pursuant to this guarantee, and determined that the fair value of our obligation based on the likely outcome is not material.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, amended accounting guidance was issued that replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. Subsequently, additional guidance was issued on several areas including guidance intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation of principal versus agent considerations and clarifications on the identification of performance obligations and implementation of guidance related to licensing. The amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are in the process of evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. The amended guidance permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the amended guidance on our ongoing financial reporting.\nIn February 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued that revised consolidation requirements in order to provide financial statement users with a more useful presentation of an entity's economic and operational results. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adopton is permitted, and the amendments may be applied using either a retrospective or modified retrospective approach. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that such costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability itself. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. Retrospective application to prior periods is required. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIn July 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued regarding the measurement of inventory. The amended guidance requires that inventory accounted for under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, where net realizable value represents the estimated selling price of inventory in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amended guidance has no impact on inventory accounted for under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or retail inventory methods. The amended guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn September 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued regarding adjustments to provisional amounts reported in conjunction with a business combination. The amended guidance requires that an acquirer in a business combination recognize adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendment also requires that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Additionally, the amendment requires the acquirer to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amended guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn November 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amended guidance requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred income tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period, and the change may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company elected to early adopt this amended accounting guidance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore prior periods have not been restated.\nIn February 2016, amended accounting guidance was issued that replaces most existing lease accounting guidance under U.S. GAAP. Among other changes, the amended guidance requires that lease assets and liabilities be recognized on the balance sheet by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the change is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. We are in the process of evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations, and we have not determined the effect of the amended guidance on our ongoing financial reporting.\nIn March 2016, amended accounting guidance was issued regarding derivatives instruments designated as hedging instruments. The amended guidance clarifies that a change in the counterparty to such a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the change may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn March 2016, amended accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for share-based payments. The amended guidance impacts several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, forfeitures, statutory withholding requirements, and classification in the statement of cash flows. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this amended accounting guidance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The impact resulting from the adoption of this amended guidance is summarized below.\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Income Tax Accounting - The amended accounting guidance requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized as an income tax benefit or expense on a prospective basis in the period of adoption. The adoption of this provision of the amended accounting guidance resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits of $3.2 million in income tax expense, rather than in paid-in capital, during fiscal 2016. As the adoption was on a prospective basis, prior periods have not been restated.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Forfeitures - The Company has elected to continue to estimate the number of awards expected to vest, as permitted by the amended accounting guidance, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Statement of Cash Flows Presentation - The amended accounting guidance requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Previously, excess tax benefits were presented as a cash inflow from financing activities and cash outflow from operating activities. The Company has elected to present these changes on a prospective basis and therefore prior periods have not been adjusted to conform with the current presentation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In June 2016, amended accounting guidance was issued related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The amended guidance changes the impairment model for most financial assets to require measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are in the process of evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations, and we have not determined the effect of the amended guidance on our ongoing financial reporting.\nEnvironmental\nWe do not believe that compliance with environmental laws has or will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, future results of operations or financial position or competitive position.\nInflation\nThe effects of inflation on our operations were not significant during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to our valuation of receivables, inventories, intangible assets, accrued liabilities, income and other tax accruals and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. These results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect our significant judgments and uncertainties that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Although actual results historically have not deviated significantly from those determined using our estimates, as discussed below, our financial position or results of operations could be materially different if we were to report under different conditions or to use different assumptions in the application of such policies. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us, as these are the primary areas where financial information is subject to our estimates, assumptions and judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition: We recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss provided evidence of an arrangement exists, pricing is fixed and determinable and the ability to collect is probable. In circumstances where the collection of payment is not probable at the time of shipment, we defer recognition of revenue until payment is collected. We provide for returns and allowances based on historical experience and current customer activities.\nReceivables: In order to ensure that our receivables are properly valued, we utilize two contra-receivable accounts: returns and allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts. Returns and allowances are used to record estimates of returns or other allowances resulting from quality, delivery, discounts or other issues affecting the value of receivables. This account is estimated based on historical trends and current market conditions, with the offset to net sales.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is used to record the estimated risk of loss related to the customers' inability to pay. This allowance is maintained at a level that we consider appropriate based on factors that affect collectability, such as the financial health of our customers, historical trends of charge-offs and recoveries and current economic and market conditions. As we monitor our receivables, we identify customers that may have payment problems, and we adjust the allowance accordingly, with the offset to SG&A expense. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when recovery is considered remote.\nWe review our receivables on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are properly valued and collectible. Based on this review, we believe our related reserves are appropriate. The reserve for doubtful accounts increased approximately $1.5 million during fiscal 2016 to $4.6 million.\nWhile we believe our allowances are adequate, changes in economic conditions, the financial health of customers and bankruptcy settlements could impact our future earnings. If the economic environment and market conditions deteriorate, particularly in the automotive and construction end markets where our exposure is greatest, additional reserves may be required.\nInventory Valuation: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method for all inventories. This assessment requires the use of significant estimates to determine replacement cost, cost to complete, normal profit margin and the ultimate selling price of the inventory. No lower of cost or market adjustment was recorded in fiscal 2016. Due to a decline in steel prices in fiscal 2015, the replacement cost of our inventory was lower than what was reflected in our records at May 31, 2015. Accordingly, we recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of $1.7 million at May 31, 2015 to reflect this lower value. The entire amount related to our Steel Processing operating segment and was recorded in cost of goods sold. We believe our inventories were valued appropriately as of May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015.\nImpairment of Definite-Lived Long-Lived Assets: We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Impairment\ntesting involves a comparison of the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group to its respective carrying amount. If the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment, if any, to be recognized. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds fair value.\nFiscal 2016: Due to the decline in oil prices and resulting reduced demand for products, management determined that an impairment indicator was present for the long-lived assets in the Oil & Gas Equipment business within Pressure Cylinders. The Company had tested the five asset groups in its Oil & Gas Equipment business for impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and again in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In each of these tests, the Company's estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows for each asset group indicated that the carrying amounts were expected to be recovered as of those measurement dates.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the continued decline of oil prices further reduced the demand for Oil & Gas Equipment products, causing a significant decrease in the long-term cash flow projections of that business. Based on these revised cash flow projections, the Company determined that long-lived assets of two of the facilities with a combined carrying amount of $59.9 million were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of $36.9 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $23.0 million. Fair value was based on expected future cash flows using Level 3 inputs under Accounting Standard Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 820. The cash flows are those expected to be generated by market participants, discounted at an appropriate rate for the risks inherent in those cash flow projections, or 13%. Because of deteriorating market conditions (i.e., rising interest rates and declining marketplace demand), it is possible that our estimate of discounted cash flows may change resulting in the need to adjust our determination of fair value.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2016, management finalized its plan to close the Engineered Cabs facility in Florence, South Carolina and transfer the majority of the business to the Engineered Cabs facility in Greeneville, Tennessee. Under the plan, certain machinery and equipment was transferred to the Greeneville facility to support higher volume requirements. Management reevaluated the recoverability of the remaining assets and determined that long-lived assets with a carrying value of $4.1 million were impaired. As a result, these long-lived assets were written down to their estimated fair value of $1.1 million resulting in an impairment charge of $3.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company ceased production at the Florence facility on September 30, 2015.\nFiscal 2015: During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we determined that indicators of impairment were present with regard to intangible assets related to our CNG fuel systems joint venture, dHybrid. Recoverability of the identified asset group was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sum of these undiscounted future cash flows was less than the net book value of the asset group. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the intangible assets were written down to their fair value, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.3 million.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company concluded that an interim impairment test of the goodwill of its Engineered Cabs reporting unit was necessary. Prior to conducting the goodwill impairment test, the Company first evaluated the other long-lived assets of the Engineered Cabs reporting unit for recoverability. Recoverability was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sums of the undiscounted future cash flows for the customer relationship intangible asset and the property, plant and equipment of the Florence, South Carolina facility were less than their respective carrying values. As a result, these assets were written down to their respective fair values, resulting in impairment charges of $22.4 million for the customer relationship intangible asset and $14.3 million for the property, plant and equipment of the Florence asset group during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As noted above, an additional impairment charge related to the Florence asset group was later recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2015, management committed to a plan to sell the assets of the Advanced Component Technologies, Inc. business within Engineered Cabs. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the net assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.4 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company completed the sale of these assets and recognized a gain of $332,000.\nAlso during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we determined that indicators of impairment were present at the Company's aluminum high-pressure cylinder business in New Albany, Mississippi, and at the Company's military construction business due to current and projected operating losses. Recoverability of the identified asset groups was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows was less than the net book value of the asset groups. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the net assets were written down to their fair values, resulting in impairment charges of $3.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company committed to a plan to sell its 60% ownership interest in Worthington Nitin Cylinders, a consolidated joint venture in India, and PSM, a stainless steel business. Accordingly, at May 31, 2014, the net assets of these businesses were recorded as assets held for sale at the lower of their fair values or net book values, less selling costs. During the first half of fiscal 2015, changes in facts and circumstances related to these businesses indicated that the Company needed to reassess the fair value of these assets. As a result, additional impairment charges of $6.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, were recorded.\nImpairment of Indefinite-Lived Long-Lived Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may be present. Application of goodwill impairment testing involves judgment, including but not limited to, the identification of reporting units and estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. With the exception of Pressure Cylinders, we test goodwill at the operating segment level as we have determined that the characteristics of the reporting units within each operating segment are similar and allow for their aggregation in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. For our Pressure Cylinders operating segment, the Oil & Gas Equipment business has been treated as a separate reporting unit since the second quarter of fiscal 2016.\nThe goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of each reporting unit, determined using discounted cash flows, to each reporting unit's respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is indicated. The amount of the impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to its estimated fair value, with the difference representing the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of earnings. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nAs a result of the impairment of the Oil & Gas Equipment assets noted above, the Company also performed an impairment review of the goodwill of the Pressure Cylinders reporting unit during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company first assessed the reporting unit structure and determined that it was no longer appropriate to aggregate the Oil & Gas Equipment component with the rest of Pressure Cylinders for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. This determination was driven by changes in the economic characteristics of the Oil & Gas Equipment business as a result of sustained low oil prices, which now indicate that the risk profile and prospects for growth and profitability of the Oil & Gas Equipment component are no\nlonger similar to the other components of our Pressure Cylinders businesses. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the Company allocated a portion of Pressure Cylinders goodwill totaling $26.0 million to the Oil & Gas Equipment reporting unit using a relative fair value approach. A subsequent comparison of the fair values of the Oil & Gas Equipment and the Pressure Cylinders reporting units, determined using discounted cash flows, to their respective carrying values indicated that a step 2 calculation to quantify a potential impairment was not required. The key assumptions that drive the fair value calculations are projected cash flows and the discount rate. Prior to the allocation of goodwill, the Company tested the goodwill of the old Pressure Cylinders reporting unit for impairment and determined that fair value exceeded carrying value by a significant amount.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company concluded that an interim impairment test of the goodwill of its Engineered Cabs reporting unit was necessary. This conclusion was based on certain indicators of impairment, including the decision to close the Company's unprofitable Engineered Cabs facility in Florence, South Carolina, and significant downward revisions to forecasted cash flows as a result of continued weakness in the mining and agricultural end markets and higher than expected manufacturing costs.\nPrior to conducting the goodwill impairment test, the Company first evaluated the other long-lived assets of the Engineered Cabs reporting unit for recoverability. Recoverability was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows for both the customer relationship intangible asset and the property, plant and equipment of the Florence facility were less than their respective carrying values. As a result, these assets were written down to their respective fair values, resulting in impairment charges of $22.4 million for the customer relationship intangible asset and $14.3 million for the property, plant and equipment of the Florence asset group during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.\nIn addition to the above, the Company also determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim goodwill analysis of the Engineered Cabs reporting unit. A comparison of the fair value of the Engineered Cabs operating segment, determined using discounted cash flows, to its carrying value indicated potential goodwill impairment. After a subsequent review of the fair value of the net assets of Engineered Cabs, it was determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was $0 and, as a result, the entire $44.9 million goodwill balance was written off during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.\nWe performed our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value; therefore, no additional impairment charges were recognized.\nAccounting for Derivatives and Other Contracts at Fair Value: We use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign currency and interest rates. Fair values for these contracts are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different assumptions could affect the estimated fair values.\nStock-Based Compensation: All share-based awards, including those to employees and non-employee directors, are recorded as expense in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant.\nIncome Taxes: In accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance, we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some, or a portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion of such deferred income tax assets will not be realized.\nIn accordance with accounting literature related to uncertainty in income taxes, tax benefits from uncertain tax positions that are recognized in the financial statements are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe have reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by taxing authorities. It is our policy to record these in income tax expense. While we believe the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are appropriate, we have established the tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge our positions. The tax reserves are analyzed periodically, and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserves, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, and release of administrative guidance or court decisions affecting a particular tax issue.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves: We are largely self-insured with respect to workers' compensation, general and automobile liability, property damage, employee medical claims and other potential losses. In order to reduce risk and better manage our overall loss exposure, we purchase stop-loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts. We maintain reserves for the estimated cost to settle open claims, which includes estimates of legal costs expected to be incurred, as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on actuarial valuations that take into consideration the historical average claim volume, the average cost for settled claims, current trends in claim costs, changes in our business and workforce, general economic factors and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimated reserves for these liabilities could be affected if future occurrences and claims differ from assumptions used and historical trends. Facility consolidations, a focus on safety initiatives and an emphasis on property loss prevention and product quality have resulted in an improvement in our loss history and the related assumptions used to analyze many of the current self-insurance reserves. We will continue to review these reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review is warranted.\nThe critical accounting policies discussed herein are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP, with a lesser need for our judgment in their application. There are also areas in which our judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result.", "item_7_truncated": " \u2022 Operating income increased $3.2 million from fiscal 2014.

The amended guidance requires that an acquirer in a business combination recognize adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendment also requires that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Additionally, the amendment requires the acquirer to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amended guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\n Capital expenditures were $97.0 million in fiscal 2016. Significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 included $19.4 million to expand capacity at TWB, our consolidated laser blanking joint venture, and $10.6 million of costs associated with the renovation of the Company's corporate headquarters, which was purchased in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 also included $4.1 million of capital outlays associated with the construction of a new cryogenics manufacturing facility in Turkey.\nFinancing activities\nThe goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of each reporting unit, determined using discounted cash flows, to each reporting unit's respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is indicated. The amount of the impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to its estimated fair value, with the difference representing the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of earnings. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended May 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nNet sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nNet sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase/\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring and other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(97.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-50.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-13.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(70.7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe common shares available for repurchase under the current authorization may be purchased from time to time, with consideration given to the market price of the common shares, the nature of other investment opportunities, cash flows from operations, general economic conditions and other relevant considerations.

following information to monitor our costs and demand in our major end markets:\nDuring fiscal 2016, we generated $413.3 million in cash from operating activities, spent $34.2 million on acquisitions and invested $97.0 million in property, plant and equipment. Additionally, we repurchased 3,500,000 of our common shares for $99.8 million, repaid $85.8 million in short-term borrowings and paid $47.2 million of dividends. The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows for each period shown:\nThe following table presents consolidated operating results for the periods indicated:\nFiscal 2016: Due to the decline in oil prices and resulting reduced demand for products, management determined that an impairment indicator was present for the long-lived assets in the Oil & Gas Equipment business within Pressure Cylinders. The Company had tested the five asset groups in its Oil & Gas Equipment business for impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and again in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In each of these tests, the Company's estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows for each asset group indicated that the carrying amounts were expected to be recovered as of those measurement dates.\nStock-Based Compensation: All share-based awards, including those to employees and non-employee directors, are recorded as expense in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company concluded that an interim impairment test of the goodwill of its Engineered Cabs reporting unit was necessary. This conclusion was based on certain indicators of impairment, including the decision to close the Company's unprofitable Engineered Cabs facility in Florence, South Carolina, and significant downward revisions to forecasted cash flows as a result of continued weakness in the mining and agricultural end markets and higher than expected manufacturing costs.\n \u2022 SG&A expense increased $1.5 million over fiscal 2015 driven by higher profit sharing and bonus expense and the impact of acquisitions. \nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nMay 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Steel Processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pressure Cylinders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Engineered Cabs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Capital Expenditures\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effects of inflation on our operations were not significant during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amended guidance requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred income tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period, and the change may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company elected to early adopt this amended accounting guidance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore prior periods have not been restated.\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

accounting guidance requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized as an income tax benefit or expense on a prospective basis in the period of adoption. The adoption of this provision of the amended accounting guidance resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits of $3.2 million in income tax expense, rather than in paid-in capital, during fiscal 2016. As the adoption was on a prospective basis, prior periods have not been restated. \n \u2022 On December 7, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the global CryoScience business of Taylor Wharton, including a manufacturing facility in Theodore, Alabama, for $30.6 million. The asset purchase was made pursuant to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of Taylor Wharton. The acquired net assets became part of the Pressure Cylinders operating segment upon closing. \nSelected statements contained in this \u201cItem 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The amended guidance impacts several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, forfeitures, statutory withholding requirements, and classification in the statement of cash flows. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this amended accounting guidance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The impact resulting from the adoption of this amended guidance is summarized below.\nPressure Cylinders\n \u2022 Equity income decreased $4.0 million from fiscal 2014 to $87.5 million. The decline was due to lower equity income at Serviacero as a result of lower steel prices ($4.0 million) and lower equity income at ClarkDietrich on lower volumes ($4.1 million), partially offset by increases at WAVE ($3.5 million) and ArtiFlex ($3.4 million). We received $78.3 million in cash distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates during fiscal 2015. All joint ventures posted positive results, led by WAVE and ArtiFlex, which contributed $70.6 million and $7.2 million of equity income, respectively.

</tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Operating income decreased $10.3 million from fiscal 2014. Gross margin declined $17.2 million as a result of lower spreads between average selling prices and material cost due to the declining price of steel. SG&A expense declined $6.3 million as a result of lower profit sharing and bonus expense and a decrease in depreciation expense partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Operating income in the current year included an impairment charge of $3.1 million compared to $7.1 million in the prior year. Impairment charges in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 related to the Company's stainless steel business, PSM. Operating income in fiscal 2014 was favorably impacted by a net restructuring gain of $3.4 million, which consisted of a $4.8 million gain on the sale of the Company's Integrated Terminals warehouse facility in Detroit, Michigan, offset by $1.4 million of severance costs accrued in connection with the closure of the Company's Baltimore steel facility. \nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended May 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nNet sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nNet sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase/\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring and other expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-20.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-19.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nAs of May 31, 2016, excluding our joint ventures, we operated 31 manufacturing facilities worldwide, principally in three operating segments, which correspond with our reportable business segments: Steel Processing, Pressure Cylinders and Engineered Cabs.

The decrease was driven by a decline in both the Construction Services business, which the Company is in the process of exiting, and the WEI business. \nIn addition to the above, the Company also determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim goodwill analysis of the Engineered Cabs reporting unit. A comparison of the fair value of the Engineered Cabs operating segment, determined using discounted cash flows, to its carrying value indicated potential goodwill impairment. After a subsequent review of the fair value of the net assets of Engineered Cabs, it was determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was $0 and, as a result, the entire $44.9 million goodwill balance was written off during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.\nCommon shares - We declared dividends at a quarterly rate of $0.19 per common share for each quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $0.18 per common share for each quarter of fiscal 2015. Dividends paid on our common shares totaled $47.2 million and $46.4 million, respectively, during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is used to record the estimated risk of loss related to the customers' inability to pay. This allowance is maintained at a level that we consider appropriate based on factors that affect collectability, such as the financial health of our customers, historical trends of charge-offs and recoveries and current economic and market conditions. As we monitor our receivables, we identify customers that may have payment problems, and we adjust the allowance accordingly, with the offset to SG&A expense. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when recovery is considered remote.\nlonger similar to the other components of our Pressure Cylinders businesses. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the Company allocated a portion of Pressure Cylinders goodwill totaling $26.0 million to the Oil & Gas Equipment reporting unit using a relative fair value approach. A subsequent comparison of the fair values of the Oil & Gas Equipment and the Pressure Cylinders reporting units, determined using discounted cash flows, to their respective carrying values indicated that a step 2 calculation to quantify a potential impairment was not required. The key assumptions that drive the fair value calculations are projected cash flows and the discount rate. Prior to the allocation of goodwill, the Company tested the goodwill of the old Pressure Cylinders reporting unit for impairment and determined that fair value exceeded carrying value by a significant amount.\n \u2022 Equity income increased $27.5 million over fiscal 2015 to $115.0 million. The equity portion of income from WAVE, ClarkDietrich, ArtiFlex and Serviacero exceeded the prior year period by $12.1 million, $11.7 million, $3.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The equity portion of income from ClarkDietrich includes a $4.5 million net legal settlement gain related to successful disparagement litigation against several competitors in an industry trade association. We received distributions of $86.5 million from our unconsolidated affiliates during fiscal 2016. For additional financial information regarding our unconsolidated affiliates, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note B - Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n \u2022 Net sales decreased $71.1 million from fiscal 2015 due to declines in market demand in most lines of business combined with the impact of the January 2015 sale of the assets of Advanced Component Technologies, Inc. and the September 2015 closure of the Florence, South Carolina facility. \n long-lived assets in Engineered Cabs. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note C - Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOur business is cyclical and cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate during the year and from year to year due to economic and industry conditions. We rely on cash and short-term borrowings to meet cyclical increases in working capital needs. These needs generally rise during periods of increased economic activity or increasing raw material prices due to higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable. During economic slowdowns, or periods of decreasing raw material costs, working capital needs generally decrease as a result of the reduction of inventories and accounts receivable.\nContractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\n \u2022 Interest expense of $35.8 million was $9.1 million higher than the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to the impact of higher average debt levels and higher average interest rates resulting from an increase in the usage of long-term debt versus short-term debt. For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note G - Debt and Receivables Securitization\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the continued decline of oil prices further reduced the demand for Oil & Gas Equipment products, causing a significant decrease in the long-term cash flow projections of that business. Based on these revised cash flow projections, the Company determined that long-lived assets of two of the facilities with a combined carrying amount of $59.9 million were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of $36.9 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $23.0 million. Fair value was based on expected future cash flows using Level 3 inputs under Accounting Standard Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 820. The cash flows are those expected to be generated by market participants, discounted at an appropriate rate for the risks inherent in those cash flow projections, or 13%. Because of deteriorating market conditions (i.e., rising interest rates and declining marketplace demand), it is possible that our estimate of discounted cash flows may change resulting in the need to adjust our determination of fair value.\n \u2022 Operating loss decreased $77.9 million from fiscal 2015 due primarily to lower impairment and restructuring charges. Excluding the impact of impairment and restructuring charges, the operating loss was $0.9 million lower than fiscal 2015 as a result of lower SG&A expense, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. Fiscal 2016 impairment charges consisted of $3.0 million related to the closure of the Florence, South Carolina facility. Impairment charges in the prior year consisted of $44.9 million for the full write off of goodwill and $39.0 million for other long-lived assets. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note C - Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Other\nOverview\nWe have reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by taxing authorities. It is our policy to record these in income tax expense. While we believe the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are appropriate, we have established the tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge our positions. The tax reserves are analyzed periodically, and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserves, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, and release of administrative guidance or court decisions affecting a particular tax issue.\nInvestment activities are largely discretionary and future investment activities could be reduced significantly or eliminated as economic conditions warrant. We assess acquisition opportunities as they arise, and such opportunities may require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that any such opportunities will arise, that any such acquisitions will be consummated or that any needed additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when required.\nWhile we believe our allowances are adequate, changes in economic conditions, the financial health of customers and bankruptcy settlements could impact our future earnings. If the economic environment and market conditions deteriorate, particularly in the automotive and construction end markets where our exposure is greatest, additional reserves may be required.\n\nMarket & Industry Overview\nOn September 26, 2014, our consolidated joint venture in Turkey, Worthington Aritas, executed a five-year term loan denominated in Euros. As of May 31, 2016, we had borrowed $28.4 million against the facility. The facility bears interest at a variable rate based on EURIBOR. The applicable variable rate was 1.500% at May 31, 2016. On October 15, 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on 60% of the borrowings outstanding under this facility at 2.015% starting on December 26, 2014 through September 26, 2019. Borrowings against the facility are being used for the construction of a new cryogenics manufacturing facility in Turkey.\nOn June 25, 2014, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10,000,000 of our outstanding common shares. An aggregate of 3,500,000 and 2,453,855 common shares were repurchased under this authorization during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. At May 31, 2016, 4,046,145 common shares remained available for repurchase under this authorization.\n \u2022 Net sales increased $209.6 million over fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by the impact of acquisitions ($109.9 million), higher volumes from existing operations ($60.5 million) and higher average selling prices due to product mix ($39.2 million). Excluding the impact of TWB, the mix of direct versus toll tons processed was unchanged from fiscal 2014 at 56% to 44%. \nSegment Operations\n \u2022 Gross margin decreased $10.9 million from fiscal 2015 on lower volume partially offset by an improved pricing spread in Steel Processing and lower manufacturing expenses across many of our businesses. \n \u2022 As of March 1, 2016, the Company reached an agreement with United States Steel Corporation (\u201cU.S. Steel\u201d), its partner in the Worthington Specialty Processing (\u201cWSP\u201d) joint venture, whereby the Company appoints a majority of the WSP Board of Directors, giving the Company effective control over the operations of WSP. As a result, WSP's results have been consolidated within the financial results of Steel Processing since that date, with the minority member's portion of earnings eliminated within earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest. In the periods prior to March 1, 2016, WSP's results had been accounted for under the equity method. As required by the applicable accounting guidance, a pre-tax gain of $6.9 million was recognized for the difference between the fair value of the Company's previously-held ownership interest in WSP and its carrying value at the acquisition date. The gain was recorded in miscellaneous income, below operating income. The ownership percentages in WSP remained unchanged at 51% Worthington and 49% U.S. Steel. \nIn March 2016, amended accounting guidance was issued regarding derivatives instruments designated as hedging instruments. The amended guidance clarifies that a change in the counterparty to such a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the change may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\n \u2022 SG&A expense decreased $4.5 million from fiscal 2014 driven by lower profit sharing and bonus expense partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. In addition, the prior year period included a net pre-tax gain of $4.0 million for the favorable settlement of a legal dispute. \n \u2022 Net sales decreased $156.5 million from fiscal 2015 on lower volume, particularly in the Oil & Gas Equipment business where volumes decreased 64%. Volumes in the current fiscal year were also negatively impacted by the May 2015 disposition of our high-pressure cylinders business in Mississippi, which generated sales of $26.8 million in the prior year. \nInventory Valuation: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method for all inventories. This assessment requires the use of significant estimates to determine replacement cost, cost to complete, normal profit margin and the ultimate selling price of the inventory. No lower of cost or market adjustment was recorded in fiscal 2016. Due to a decline in steel prices in fiscal 2015, the replacement cost of our inventory was lower than what was reflected in our records at May 31, 2015. Accordingly, we recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of $1.7 million at May 31, 2015 to reflect this lower value. The entire amount related to our Steel Processing operating segment and was recorded in cost of goods sold. We believe our inventories were valued appropriately as of May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015.\n \u2022 Net sales decreased $302.0 million from fiscal 2015 as lower average steel prices led to lower average selling prices, reducing net sales by approximately $260.5 million. The remaining decrease in net sales was due to the closure of the Company's stainless steel business, PSM, in the current year, partially offset by contributions from recent acquisitions. The mix of direct versus toll tons processed was 58% to 42% compared to 59% to 41% in fiscal 2015. \nIntroduction\n \u2022 Income tax expense decreased $31.5 million from fiscal 2014 on lower earnings and an approximately $5.3 million benefit related to foreign tax credits, offset partially by favorable tax adjustments recorded in the prior year including $7.1 million associated with the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in TWB, $2.3 million associated with the write off of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, and $2.2 million of research and development credits.  Fiscal 2015 income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate attributable to controlling interest of 25.1% vs. 27.5% in fiscal 2014. The 25.1% rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of benefits from the qualified production activities deduction and the benefit related to foreign tax credits, offset partially by state and local income taxes. For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note L - Income Taxes\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to our valuation of receivables, inventories, intangible assets, accrued liabilities, income and other tax accruals and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe\nIn July 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued regarding the measurement of inventory. The amended guidance requires that inventory accounted for under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, where net realizable value represents the estimated selling price of inventory in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amended guidance has no impact on inventory accounted for under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or retail inventory methods. The amended guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe also held equity positions in 12 active joint ventures, which operated 51 manufacturing facilities worldwide, as of May 31, 2016. Six of these joint ventures are consolidated with the equity owned by the other joint venture member(s) shown as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets, and the other joint venture member(s)' portion of net earnings and other comprehensive income shown as net earnings or comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, respectively. The remaining six of these joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n \u2022 On January 15, 2016, the Company acquired the net assets of NetBraze, LLC, a manufacturer of brazing alloys, silver brazing filler metals, solders and fluxes, for $3.4 million. The acquired net assets became part of the Pressure Cylinders operating segment upon closing. \n1 2015/2014 figures based on revised actuals 2 CRU Hot-Rolled Index; period average 3 IHS Global 4 LME Zinc; period average 5 NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas; period average 6 Energy Information Administration; period average\n related to the Company's 60%-owned consolidated joint venture in India, $3.2 million related to the Company's aluminum high-pressure cylinder business in New Albany, Mississippi, and $2.3 million for the partial impairment of intangible assets related to our dHybrid joint venture. Impairment charges in the prior year consisted primarily of $19.0 million related to the Company's 60%-owned consolidated joint venture in India and $11.6 million related to the write off of certain trade name intangible assets as a result of a re-branding initiative. Restructuring expense of $6.4 million consisted primarily of employee severance related to workforce reductions in our Oil & Gas Equipment businesses ($2.2 million) and a net loss on the sale of the Company's aluminum high-pressure cylinder business in New Albany, Mississippi ($3.3 million). \n \u2022 Operating loss decreased $2.8 million from fiscal 2014. The improvement resulted from lower losses within Construction Services partially offset by impairment charges of $1.2 million related to the military construction business.  Liquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 During fiscal 2016, we repurchased a total of 3,500,000 common shares for $99.8 million at an average price of $28.53. \nWe maintain a $500.0 million multi-year revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with a group of lenders that matures in April 2020. Borrowings under the Credit Facility typically have maturities of less than one year and given that our intention has been to repay them within a year, they have been classified as short-term borrowings within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. However, we can also extend the term of amounts borrowed by renewing these borrowings for the term of the Credit Facility. We have the option to borrow at rates equal to an applicable margin over the LIBOR, Prime or Fed Funds rates. The applicable margin is determined by our credit rating. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at May 31, 2016.\n \u2022 Forfeitures - The Company has elected to continue to estimate the number of awards expected to vest, as permitted by the amended accounting guidance, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur. \nThe critical accounting policies discussed herein are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP, with a lesser need for our judgment in their application. There are also areas in which our judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves: We are largely self-insured with respect to workers' compensation, general and automobile liability, property damage, employee medical claims and other potential losses. In order to reduce risk and better manage our overall loss exposure, we purchase stop-loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts. We maintain reserves for the estimated cost to settle open claims, which includes estimates of legal costs expected to be incurred, as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on actuarial valuations that take into consideration the historical average claim volume, the average cost for settled claims, current trends in claim costs, changes in our business and workforce, general economic factors and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimated reserves for these liabilities could be affected if future occurrences and claims differ from assumptions used and historical trends. Facility consolidations, a focus on safety initiatives and an emphasis on property loss prevention and product quality have resulted in an improvement in our loss history and the related assumptions used to analyze many of the current self-insurance reserves. We will continue to review these reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review is warranted.\nThe market price of hot-rolled steel is one of the most significant factors impacting our selling prices and operating results. When steel prices fall, we typically have higher-priced material flowing through cost of goods sold, while selling prices compress to what the market will bear, negatively impacting our results. On the other hand, in a rising price environment, our results are generally favorably impacted, as lower-priced material purchased in previous periods flows through cost of goods sold, while our selling prices increase at a faster pace to cover current replacement costs.\nSubstantially all of the net sales of our Pressure Cylinders operating segment, and approximately 25% and 48% of the net sales of our Steel Processing and Engineered Cabs operating segments, respectively, are to other markets such as consumer products, industrial, lawn and garden, agriculture, oil and gas equipment, heavy truck, mining, forestry and appliance. Given the many different products that make up these net sales and the wide variety of end markets, it is very difficult to detail the key market indicators that drive this portion of our business. However, we believe that the trend in U.S. GDP growth is a good economic indicator for analyzing these operating segments.\nApproximately 10% of the net sales of our Steel Processing operating segment, 52% of the net sales of our Engineered Cabs operating segment and substantially all of the net sales of our Construction Services operating segment are to the construction market. The construction market is also the predominant end market for two of our unconsolidated joint ventures: WAVE and ClarkDietrich. While the market price of steel significantly impacts these businesses, there are other key indicators that are meaningful in analyzing construction market demand, including U.S. gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d), the Dodge Index of construction contracts and, in the case of ClarkDietrich, trends in the relative price of framing lumber and steel.\nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Pressure Cylinders operating segment for the periods indicated:\nThe automotive industry is one of the largest consumers of flat-rolled steel, and thus the largest end market for our Steel Processing operating segment. Approximately 65% of the net sales of our Steel Processing operating segment are to the automotive market. North American vehicle production, primarily by FCA US, Ford and General Motors (the \u201cDetroit Three automakers\u201d), has a considerable impact on the activity within this operating segment. The majority of the net sales of three of our unconsolidated joint ventures are also to the automotive end market.\nSteel Processing\nInvesting activities\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Engineered Cabs operating segment for the periods indicated:\n We believe we have access to adequate resources to meet our needs for normal operating costs, capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividend payments and working capital for our existing businesses. These resources include cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and unused lines of credit. We also believe we have adequate access to the financial markets to allow us to be in a position to sell long-term debt or equity securities. However, uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets may impact our ability to access capital and the terms under which we can do so.\nIn April 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that such costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability itself. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. Retrospective application to prior periods is required. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nWorthington Industries, Inc. is a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Ohio (individually, the \u201cRegistrant\u201d or \u201cWorthington Industries\u201d or, collectively with the subsidiaries of Worthington Industries, Inc., \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cWorthington\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). Founded in 1955, Worthington is primarily a diversified metals manufacturing company, focused on value-added steel processing and manufactured metal products. Our manufactured metal products include: pressure cylinders for liquefied petroleum gas (\u201cLPG\u201d), compressed natural gas (\u201cCNG\u201d), oxygen, refrigerant and other industrial gas storage; hand torches and filled hand torch cylinders; propane-filled camping cylinders; helium-filled balloon kits; steel and fiberglass tanks and processing equipment primarily for the oil and gas industry; cryogenic pressure vessels for liquefied natural gas (\u201cLNG\u201d) and other gas storage applications; engineered cabs and operator stations and cab components; and, through joint ventures, suspension grid systems for concealed and lay-in panel ceilings; laser welded blanks; light gauge steel framing for commercial and residential construction; and current and past model automotive service stampings. Our number one goal is to increase shareholder value, which we seek to accomplish by optimizing existing operations, developing and commercializing new products and applications, and pursuing strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company committed to a plan to sell its 60% ownership interest in Worthington Nitin Cylinders, a consolidated joint venture in India, and PSM, a stainless steel business. Accordingly, at May 31, 2014, the net assets of these businesses were recorded as assets held for sale at the lower of their fair values or net book values, less selling costs. During the first half of fiscal 2015, changes in facts and circumstances related to these businesses indicated that the Company needed to reassess the fair value of these assets. As a result, additional impairment charges of $6.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, were recorded.\n\n Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nShort-term borrowings at May 31, 2016, consisted of an aggregate of $2.6 million outstanding under various credit facilities maintained by our consolidated joint venture, Worthington Aritas.\nResults of Operations\nCertain other commodities, such as zinc, natural gas and diesel fuel, represent a significant portion of our cost of goods sold, both directly through our plant operations and indirectly through transportation and freight expense.\nWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. However, as of May 31, 2016, we were party to an operating lease for an aircraft in which we have guaranteed a residual value at the termination of the lease. The maximum obligation under the terms of this guarantee was approximately $10.5 million at May 31, 2016. Based on current facts and circumstances, we have estimated the likelihood of payment pursuant to this guarantee, and determined that the fair value of our obligation based on the likely outcome is not material.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company concluded that an interim impairment test of the goodwill of its Engineered Cabs reporting unit was necessary. Prior to conducting the goodwill impairment test, the Company first evaluated the other long-lived assets of the Engineered Cabs reporting unit for recoverability. Recoverability was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sums of the undiscounted future cash flows for the customer relationship intangible asset and the property, plant and equipment of the Florence, South Carolina facility were less than their respective carrying values. As a result, these assets were written down to their respective fair values, resulting in impairment charges of $22.4 million for the customer relationship intangible asset and $14.3 million for the property, plant and equipment of the Florence asset group during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As noted above, an additional impairment charge related to the Florence asset group was later recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nWe currently have no material contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. Dividends are declared at the discretion of the Board. The Board reviews the dividend quarterly and establishes the dividend rate based upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, current and projected cash flows, business prospects and other relevant factors. While we have paid a dividend every quarter since becoming a public company in 1968, there is no guarantee that payments will continue in the future.\n \u2022 Miscellaneous income increased $10.5 million over fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily the result of a $6.9 million pre-tax gain related to the consolidation of WSP. The gain represents the difference between the fair value of the Company's previously-held ownership interest in WSP and its carrying value at the acquisition date. For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note O - Acquisitions\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Steel Processing operating segment for the periods indicated:\nImpairment of Indefinite-Lived Long-Lived Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may be present. Application of goodwill impairment testing involves judgment, including but not limited to, the identification of reporting units and estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. With the exception of Pressure Cylinders, we test goodwill at the operating segment level as we have determined that the characteristics of the reporting units within each operating segment are similar and allow for their aggregation in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. For our Pressure Cylinders operating segment, the Oil & Gas Equipment business has been treated as a separate reporting unit since the second quarter of fiscal 2016.\n \u2022 Net sales decreased $564.5 million from fiscal 2015. The decrease was driven by lower average selling prices in Steel Processing due to the market price of steel and by lower volume in Pressure Cylinders and Engineered Cabs, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. \nU.S. GDP growth rate trends are generally indicative of the strength in demand and, in many cases, pricing for our products. A year-over-year increase in U.S. GDP growth rates is indicative of a stronger economy, which generally increases demand and pricing for our products. Conversely, decreasing U.S. GDP growth rates generally indicate a weaker economy. Changes in U.S. GDP growth rates can also signal changes in conversion costs related to production and in selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expense.\nIn February 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued that revised consolidation requirements in order to provide financial statement users with a more useful presentation of an entity's economic and operational results. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adopton is permitted, and the amendments may be applied using either a retrospective or modified retrospective approach. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\n \u2022 Interest expense of $31.7 million was $4.1 million lower than the prior fiscal year. The decrease was driven by lower average debt levels as a result of a decrease in working capital requirements due to the lower average market price of steel. For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note G - Debt and Receivables Securitization\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nPressure Cylinders\nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Engineered Cabs operating segment for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 Net sales increased $257.8 million over fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by the impact of acquisitions ($185.6 million) and higher volumes from existing operations ($123.7 million), partially offset by lower average selling prices ($51.5 million). \nCapital expenditures reflect cash used for investment in property, plant and equipment and are presented below by reportable business segment (this information excludes cash flows related to acquisition and divestiture activity):\nInflation\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2016, management finalized its plan to close the Engineered Cabs facility in Florence, South Carolina and transfer the majority of the business to the Engineered Cabs facility in Greeneville, Tennessee. Under the plan, certain machinery and equipment was transferred to the Greeneville facility to support higher volume requirements. Management reevaluated the recoverability of the remaining assets and determined that long-lived assets with a carrying value of $4.1 million were impaired. As a result, these long-lived assets were written down to their estimated fair value of $1.1 million resulting in an impairment charge of $3.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company ceased production at the Florence facility on September 30, 2015.\nNo single customer contributed more than 10% of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2016. While our automotive business is largely driven by the production schedules of the Detroit Three automakers, our customer base is much broader and includes other domestic manufacturers and many of their suppliers. During fiscal 2016, vehicle production for the Detroit Three automakers was up 3%. North American vehicle production as a whole also increased 3%.\nThe Other category includes the Construction Services and WEI operating segments, which do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure. Certain income and expense items not allocated to our operating segments are also included in the Other category. The following table presents a summary of operating results for the Other category for the periods indicated:\nRecent Business Developments\n \u2022 Impairment charges of $100.1 million consisted primarily of $83.9 million related to Engineered Cabs, including $44.9 million for the full write off of goodwill. Impairment charges in the comparable prior year period consisted primarily of $30.7 million related to the write off of certain trade name intangible assets as a result of a re-branding initiative and $19.0 million related to the Company's 60%-owned consolidated joint venture in India. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note C - Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nWe performed our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value; therefore, no additional impairment charges were recognized.\nItem 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of May 31, 2016. These commercial commitments are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet.\nOperating activities\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2015, management committed to a plan to sell the assets of the Advanced Component Technologies, Inc. business within Engineered Cabs. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the net assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.4 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company completed the sale of these assets and recognized a gain of $332,000.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSteel Processing\nAs a result of the impairment of the Oil & Gas Equipment assets noted above, the Company also performed an impairment review of the goodwill of the Pressure Cylinders reporting unit during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company first assessed the reporting unit structure and determined that it was no longer appropriate to aggregate the Oil & Gas Equipment component with the rest of Pressure Cylinders for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. This determination was driven by changes in the economic characteristics of the Oil & Gas Equipment business as a result of sustained low oil prices, which now indicate that the risk profile and prospects for growth and profitability of the Oil & Gas Equipment component are no\n \u2022 Income tax increased $33.2 million over fiscal 2015 due to higher earnings and an approximately $5.3 million benefit related to foreign tax credits recorded in the prior year, partially offset by a $3.2 million tax benefit representing excess tax benefits from share-based payment awards recorded in income tax expense resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance as described in \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Standards\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Fiscal 2016 income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate attributable to controlling interest of 29.1% vs. 25.1% in fiscal 2015. The 29.1% rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower tax rates on foreign income, benefits from the qualified production activities deduction, and the adoption of the new accounting guidance described above with respect to share-based payment awards, offset partially by state and local income taxes. For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note L - Income Taxes\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental\nIn February 2016, amended accounting guidance was issued that replaces most existing lease accounting guidance under U.S. GAAP. Among other changes, the amended guidance requires that lease assets and liabilities be recognized on the balance sheet by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the change is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. We are in the process of evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations, and we have not determined the effect of the amended guidance on our ongoing financial reporting.\nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Steel Processing operating segment for the periods indicated:\n Fiscal 2016 net earnings attributable to controlling interest increased $66.9 million over fiscal 2015. Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nPrior to conducting the goodwill impairment test, the Company first evaluated the other long-lived assets of the Engineered Cabs reporting unit for recoverability. Recoverability was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows for both the customer relationship intangible asset and the property, plant and equipment of the Florence facility were less than their respective carrying values. As a result, these assets were written down to their respective fair values, resulting in impairment charges of $22.4 million for the customer relationship intangible asset and $14.3 million for the property, plant and equipment of the Florence asset group during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.\nEquity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates (\u201cequity income\u201d) was up 31% in fiscal 2016 to $115.0 million on higher contributions from all of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Strong automotive and construction markets and lower steel costs have benefited these businesses. We received distributions of $86.5 million from our unconsolidated affiliates during fiscal 2016.\nWe review our receivables on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are properly valued and collectible. Based on this review, we believe our related reserves are appropriate. The reserve for doubtful accounts increased approximately $1.5 million during fiscal 2016 to $4.6 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $413.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $214.4 million in fiscal 2015. The $198.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by declining working capital levels as a result of lower average steel prices and higher earnings.\nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Pressure Cylinders operating segment for the periods indicated:\nAccounting for Derivatives and Other Contracts at Fair Value: We use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign currency and interest rates. Fair values for these contracts are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different assumptions could affect the estimated fair values.\nDividend Policy\nOn June 29, 2011, the Board of Worthington Industries, Inc. authorized the repurchase of up to 10,000,000 of our outstanding common shares of which none remained available for repurchase at May 31, 2016. During fiscal 2015, 1,722,332 common shares were repurchased under this authorization.\n \u2022 Net sales increased $73.0 million over fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by recent acquisitions ($81.3 million) and an increase in Oil & Gas Equipment sales, partially offset by lower industrial products volume and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on European sales. \n Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\n \u2022 Operating income increased $3.3 million over fiscal 2015. The increase was driven by an improved pricing spread and lower inventory holding losses. Higher SG&A expense, driven by the impact of acquisitions and higher profit sharing and bonus expense, combined with current period restructuring activities partially offset the overall increase in operating income. Restructuring and other expense in the current period consisted primarily of costs related to the closure of PSM ($7.0 million), which were partially offset by a net gain related to the disposal of the remaining fixed assets of our legacy Baltimore steel processing facility ($3.0 million). The $3.1 million impairment charge in the prior year period related to the closure of the PSM facility. \n \u2022 Net sales decreased $17.3 million from fiscal 2014. The decrease was driven by declines in both the Construction Services and WEI businesses. \nto be reasonable under the circumstances. These results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect our significant judgments and uncertainties that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Although actual results historically have not deviated significantly from those determined using our estimates, as discussed below, our financial position or results of operations could be materially different if we were to report under different conditions or to use different assumptions in the application of such policies. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us, as these are the primary areas where financial information is subject to our estimates, assumptions and judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents the average quarterly market price per ton of hot-rolled steel during fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014:\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of May 31, 2016. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n \u2022 Restructuring and other expense of $7.2 million consisted of $7.0 million in net restructuring charges related to the ongoing closure of the Company's stainless steel business, Precision Specialty Metals, Inc. (\u201cPSM\u201d), $1.8 million of employee severance related to workforce reduction in Oil & Gas Equipment and $3.2 million of facility exit costs related to the closure of the Florence, South Carolina facility in Engineered Cabs. A net gain of $6.9 million on asset disposals partially offset the impact of these items. The net gain was related primarily to the disposal of the remaining fixed assets of our legacy Baltimore steel processing facility ($3.0 million), the sale of the Worthington Nitin Cylinders joint venture in India ($1.9 million), and the sale of real estate in our legacy metal framing business ($1.5 million). For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note D - Restructuring and Other Expense\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nFiscal 2015: During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we determined that indicators of impairment were present with regard to intangible assets related to our CNG fuel systems joint venture, dHybrid. Recoverability of the identified asset group was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sum of these undiscounted future cash flows was less than the net book value of the asset group. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the intangible assets were written down to their fair value, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.3 million.\ntesting involves a comparison of the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group to its respective carrying amount. If the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment, if any, to be recognized. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds fair value.\nLong-term debt - Our senior unsecured long-term debt is rated \u201cinvestment grade\u201d by both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. We typically use the net proceeds from long-term debt for acquisitions, refinancing of outstanding debt, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. As of May 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our long-term financial debt covenants. Our long-term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions.\n \u2022 Statement of Cash Flows Presentation - The amended accounting guidance requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Previously, excess tax benefits were presented as a cash inflow from financing activities and cash outflow from operating activities. The Company has elected to present these changes on a prospective basis and therefore prior periods have not been adjusted to conform with the current presentation.  In June 2016, amended accounting guidance was issued related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The amended guidance changes the impairment model for most financial assets to require measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are in the process of evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations, and we have not determined the effect of the amended guidance on our ongoing financial reporting.\n * Mississippi, an industrial gas facility, was sold in May 2015. It has been identified separately so as not to distort the Industrial Products comparisons as the products previously produced at the Mississippi facility have been discontinued.  Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nShort-term borrowings - Our short-term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions. We were in compliance with our short-term financial debt covenants at May 31, 2016.\nWe maintain a $100.0 million revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility (the \u201cAR Facility\u201d) that expires in January 2018 and was available throughout fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the AR Facility, certain of our subsidiaries sell their accounts receivable without recourse, on a revolving basis, to Worthington Receivables Corporation (\u201cWRC\u201d), a wholly-owned, consolidated, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary. In turn, WRC may sell without recourse, on a revolving basis, up to $100.0 million of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multi-seller, asset-backed commercial paper conduit (the \u201cConduit\u201d). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of A1/P1 commercial paper. We retain an undivided interest in this pool and are subject to risk of loss based on the collectability of the receivables from this retained interest. Because the amount eligible to be sold excludes receivables more than 90 days past due, receivables offset by an allowance for doubtful accounts due to bankruptcy or other cause, concentrations over certain limits with specific customers and certain reserve amounts, we believe additional risk of loss is minimal. The book value of the retained portion of the pool of accounts receivable approximates fair value. As of May 31, 2016, no undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable had been sold.\n \u2022 Impairment charges of $26.0 million in fiscal 2016 consisted of $23.0 million related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets in our Oil & Gas Equipment business and $3.0 million related to the September 30, 2015 closure of the Engineered Cabs facility in Florence, South Carolina. Impairment charges in the prior year related primarily to the impairment of goodwill and other \nWe do not believe that compliance with environmental laws has or will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, future results of operations or financial position or competitive position.\nAlso during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we determined that indicators of impairment were present at the Company's aluminum high-pressure cylinder business in New Albany, Mississippi, and at the Company's military construction business due to current and projected operating losses. Recoverability of the identified asset groups was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows was less than the net book value of the asset groups. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the net assets were written down to their fair values, resulting in impairment charges of $3.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\n \u2022 Operating income of $1.0 million represents a $10.0 million improvement from the $9.0 million operating loss recognized in fiscal 2015. The improvement resulted from lower losses within Construction Services, which the Company is exiting, and a net gain within restructuring and other income related to the sale of real estate in our legacy metal framing business.  Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nConsolidated Operations\nNet cash used by financing activities was $233.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $170.3 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2016, we paid $99.8 million to repurchase 3,500,000 of our common shares, reduced short-term borrowings by $85.8 million, and paid dividends of $47.2 million on our common shares.\n\nIn May 2014, amended accounting guidance was issued that replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. Subsequently, additional guidance was issued on several areas including guidance intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation of principal versus agent considerations and clarifications on the identification of performance obligations and implementation of guidance related to licensing. The amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are in the process of evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. The amended guidance permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the amended guidance on our ongoing financial reporting.\n1 CRU Hot-Rolled Index\nRevenue Recognition: We recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss provided evidence of an arrangement exists, pricing is fixed and determinable and the ability to collect is probable. In circumstances where the collection of payment is not probable at the time of shipment, we defer recognition of revenue until payment is collected. We provide for returns and allowances based on historical experience and current customer activities.\n \u2022 Restructuring expense of $6.5 million consisted primarily of employee severance related to workforce reductions in our Oil & Gas Equipment businesses ($2.2 million) and a net loss on the sale of the Company's aluminum high-pressure cylinder business in New Albany, Mississippi ($3.3 million). For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note D - Restructuring and Other Expense\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nEngineered Cabs\n Interest expense on long-term debt is computed by using the fixed rates of interest on the debt, including impacts of the related interest rate hedge. Royalty obligations relate to a trademark license agreement executed in connection with the acquisition of Coleman Cylinders in fiscal 2012. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits of $2.8 million, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the periods of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities and have not included this amount in the contractual cash obligations table above.\n \u2022 Operating income decreased $29.8 million from fiscal 2015 as declines in the Oil & Gas Equipment business more than offset improvements in the Industrial Products and Consumer Products businesses resulting from lower commodity input prices and lower overall manufacturing costs. Impairment charges in the current period related to the partial write-off of certain long-lived assets in the Oil & Gas Equipment business. \nNet cash used by investing activities was $127.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $203.1 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease of $76.1 million was driven primarily by lower acquisition activity in the current year. During fiscal 2016, we spent a combined $34.2 million, net of cash acquired, for the net assets of the CryoScience business of Taylor Wharton and the net assets of NetBraze, LLC. Comparatively, during fiscal 2015, we spent a combined $105.3 million, net of cash acquired, for the net assets of Rome Strip Steel, Midstream Equipment Fabrication, LLC and James Russell Engineering Works, Inc. and our 79.59% interest in dHybrid Systems, LLC. We also made capital expenditures of $97.0 million and received $9.8 million in proceeds from asset sales during fiscal 2016.\n \u2022 Gross margin decreased $29.0 million from fiscal 2014. The decrease was driven by declines in the oil and gas equipment and industrial products end markets in Pressure Cylinders, inventory holding losses in Steel Processing and higher manufacturing expenses, partially offset by contributions from recent acquisitions. \nThe following table presents consolidated operating results for the periods indicated:\nEngineered Cabs\n \u2022 Net sales decreased $7.5 million from fiscal 2014. The decrease was driven by lower tooling revenue from startup programs and the January 2015 sale of the assets of Advanced Component Technologies, Inc. \nImpairment of Definite-Lived Long-Lived Assets: We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Impairment\nSegment Operations\nIncome Taxes: In accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance, we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some, or a portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion of such deferred income tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Other category includes the Construction Services and WEI operating segments, which do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure. Certain income and expense items not allocated to our operating segments are also included in the Other category, including costs associated with our captive insurance company. The following table presents a summary of operating results for the Other category for the periods indicated:\n * Mississippi, an industrial gas facility, was sold in May 2015. It has been identified separately so as not to distort the Industrial Products comparisons as the products previously produced at the Mississippi facility have been discontinued.  Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nReceivables: In order to ensure that our receivables are properly valued, we utilize two contra-receivable accounts: returns and allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts. Returns and allowances are used to record estimates of returns or other allowances resulting from quality, delivery, discounts or other issues affecting the value of receivables. This account is estimated based on historical trends and current market conditions, with the offset to net sales.", "item_7_text": " \u2022 Operating income increased $3.2 million from fiscal 2014. Gross margin increased $5.3 million on contributions from recent acquisitions partially offset by high manufacturing costs in certain Oil & Gas Equipment locations and lower volume in industrial products. SG&A expense increased $15.1 million due to the impact of acquisitions and the favorable prior year impact of a $4.0 million net pre-tax litigation gain. Fiscal 2015 impairment charges of $11.9 million consisted of $6.4 million \n Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nOther\n Fiscal 2015 net earnings attributable to controlling interest decreased $74.5 million from fiscal 2014. Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nPerformance was steady during fiscal 2016 despite challenging market conditions resulting from lower average steel and oil prices. A higher spread between average selling prices and material cost and improved operations in the industrial and consumer products businesses in Pressure Cylinders helped to offset the impact of inventory holding losses in Steel Processing and lower volume in the Oil & Gas Equipment business within Pressure Cylinders. Demand remained steady in most of our key end markets, with the exception of the oil and gas equipment and agricultural end markets.\nIn September 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued regarding adjustments to provisional amounts reported in conjunction with a business combination. The amended guidance requires that an acquirer in a business combination recognize adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendment also requires that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Additionally, the amendment requires the acquirer to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amended guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\n Capital expenditures were $97.0 million in fiscal 2016. Significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 included $19.4 million to expand capacity at TWB, our consolidated laser blanking joint venture, and $10.6 million of costs associated with the renovation of the Company's corporate headquarters, which was purchased in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 also included $4.1 million of capital outlays associated with the construction of a new cryogenics manufacturing facility in Turkey.\nFinancing activities\nThe goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of each reporting unit, determined using discounted cash flows, to each reporting unit's respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is indicated. The amount of the impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to its estimated fair value, with the difference representing the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of earnings. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nThe common shares available for repurchase under the current authorization may be purchased from time to time, with consideration given to the market price of the common shares, the nature of other investment opportunities, cash flows from operations, general economic conditions and other relevant considerations. Repurchases may be made on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.\nNet sales and operating highlights were as follows:\n \u2022 Operating loss increased $70.7 million over fiscal 2014 on higher impairment charges, which were up $64.8 million. Excluding the impact of impairment charges, operating loss increased $6.0 million largely due to lower average selling prices and higher operating costs at the facility in Florence, South Carolina. Fiscal 2015 impairment charges consisted of $44.9 million for the full write off of goodwill and $39.0 million for other long-lived assets. Impairment charges in the prior year consisted of $19.1 million related to the write off of certain trade name intangible assets in connection with a re-branding initiative. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note C - Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe use the following information to monitor our costs and demand in our major end markets:\nDuring fiscal 2016, we generated $413.3 million in cash from operating activities, spent $34.2 million on acquisitions and invested $97.0 million in property, plant and equipment. Additionally, we repurchased 3,500,000 of our common shares for $99.8 million, repaid $85.8 million in short-term borrowings and paid $47.2 million of dividends. The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows for each period shown:\nThe following table presents consolidated operating results for the periods indicated:\nFiscal 2016: Due to the decline in oil prices and resulting reduced demand for products, management determined that an impairment indicator was present for the long-lived assets in the Oil & Gas Equipment business within Pressure Cylinders. The Company had tested the five asset groups in its Oil & Gas Equipment business for impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and again in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In each of these tests, the Company's estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows for each asset group indicated that the carrying amounts were expected to be recovered as of those measurement dates.\nStock-Based Compensation: All share-based awards, including those to employees and non-employee directors, are recorded as expense in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company concluded that an interim impairment test of the goodwill of its Engineered Cabs reporting unit was necessary. This conclusion was based on certain indicators of impairment, including the decision to close the Company's unprofitable Engineered Cabs facility in Florence, South Carolina, and significant downward revisions to forecasted cash flows as a result of continued weakness in the mining and agricultural end markets and higher than expected manufacturing costs.\n \u2022 SG&A expense increased $1.5 million over fiscal 2015 driven by higher profit sharing and bonus expense and the impact of acquisitions. \nThe effects of inflation on our operations were not significant during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amended guidance requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred income tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period, and the change may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company elected to early adopt this amended accounting guidance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore prior periods have not been restated.\nConsolidated Operations\n \u2022 Income Tax Accounting - The amended accounting guidance requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized as an income tax benefit or expense on a prospective basis in the period of adoption. The adoption of this provision of the amended accounting guidance resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits of $3.2 million in income tax expense, rather than in paid-in capital, during fiscal 2016. As the adoption was on a prospective basis, prior periods have not been restated. \n \u2022 On December 7, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the global CryoScience business of Taylor Wharton, including a manufacturing facility in Theodore, Alabama, for $30.6 million. The asset purchase was made pursuant to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of Taylor Wharton. The acquired net assets became part of the Pressure Cylinders operating segment upon closing. \nSelected statements contained in this \u201cItem 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based, in whole or in part, on management's beliefs, estimates, assumptions and currently available information. For a more detailed discussion of what constitutes a forward-looking statement and of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, please refer to the \u201cSafe Harbor Statement\u201d in the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and \u201cPart I - Item 1A. - Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nIn March 2016, amended accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for share-based payments. The amended guidance impacts several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, forfeitures, statutory withholding requirements, and classification in the statement of cash flows. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this amended accounting guidance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The impact resulting from the adoption of this amended guidance is summarized below.\nPressure Cylinders\n \u2022 Equity income decreased $4.0 million from fiscal 2014 to $87.5 million. The decline was due to lower equity income at Serviacero as a result of lower steel prices ($4.0 million) and lower equity income at ClarkDietrich on lower volumes ($4.1 million), partially offset by increases at WAVE ($3.5 million) and ArtiFlex ($3.4 million). We received $78.3 million in cash distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates during fiscal 2015. All joint ventures posted positive results, led by WAVE and ArtiFlex, which contributed $70.6 million and $7.2 million of equity income, respectively. For additional financial information regarding our unconsolidated affiliates, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note B - Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nWe also had letters of credit totaling $16.4 million outstanding as of May 31, 2016. These letters of credit have been issued to third-party service providers and had no amounts drawn against them at May 31, 2016.\nIn accordance with accounting literature related to uncertainty in income taxes, tax benefits from uncertain tax positions that are recognized in the financial statements are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\n \u2022 On June 29, 2016, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, an increase of $0.01 per share from the previous quarterly rate. The dividend is payable on September 29, 2016 to shareholders of record on September 15, 2016. \n \u2022 Operating income decreased $10.3 million from fiscal 2014. Gross margin declined $17.2 million as a result of lower spreads between average selling prices and material cost due to the declining price of steel. SG&A expense declined $6.3 million as a result of lower profit sharing and bonus expense and a decrease in depreciation expense partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Operating income in the current year included an impairment charge of $3.1 million compared to $7.1 million in the prior year. Impairment charges in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 related to the Company's stainless steel business, PSM. Operating income in fiscal 2014 was favorably impacted by a net restructuring gain of $3.4 million, which consisted of a $4.8 million gain on the sale of the Company's Integrated Terminals warehouse facility in Detroit, Michigan, offset by $1.4 million of severance costs accrued in connection with the closure of the Company's Baltimore steel facility. \n Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nAs of May 31, 2016, excluding our joint ventures, we operated 31 manufacturing facilities worldwide, principally in three operating segments, which correspond with our reportable business segments: Steel Processing, Pressure Cylinders and Engineered Cabs. Our remaining operating segments, which do not meet the applicable aggregation criteria or quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure, are combined and reported in the \u201cOther\u201d category. These include Construction Services and Worthington Energy Innovations (\u201cWEI\u201d). The Company is in the process of exiting the businesses within Construction Services.\nWe sell our products and services to a diverse customer base and a broad range of end markets. The breakdown of our net sales by end market for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 is illustrated in the following chart:\n \u2022 Net sales decreased $34.9 million from fiscal 2015. The decrease was driven by a decline in both the Construction Services business, which the Company is in the process of exiting, and the WEI business. \nIn addition to the above, the Company also determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim goodwill analysis of the Engineered Cabs reporting unit. A comparison of the fair value of the Engineered Cabs operating segment, determined using discounted cash flows, to its carrying value indicated potential goodwill impairment. After a subsequent review of the fair value of the net assets of Engineered Cabs, it was determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was $0 and, as a result, the entire $44.9 million goodwill balance was written off during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.\nCommon shares - We declared dividends at a quarterly rate of $0.19 per common share for each quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $0.18 per common share for each quarter of fiscal 2015. Dividends paid on our common shares totaled $47.2 million and $46.4 million, respectively, during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is used to record the estimated risk of loss related to the customers' inability to pay. This allowance is maintained at a level that we consider appropriate based on factors that affect collectability, such as the financial health of our customers, historical trends of charge-offs and recoveries and current economic and market conditions. As we monitor our receivables, we identify customers that may have payment problems, and we adjust the allowance accordingly, with the offset to SG&A expense. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when recovery is considered remote.\nlonger similar to the other components of our Pressure Cylinders businesses. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the Company allocated a portion of Pressure Cylinders goodwill totaling $26.0 million to the Oil & Gas Equipment reporting unit using a relative fair value approach. A subsequent comparison of the fair values of the Oil & Gas Equipment and the Pressure Cylinders reporting units, determined using discounted cash flows, to their respective carrying values indicated that a step 2 calculation to quantify a potential impairment was not required. The key assumptions that drive the fair value calculations are projected cash flows and the discount rate. Prior to the allocation of goodwill, the Company tested the goodwill of the old Pressure Cylinders reporting unit for impairment and determined that fair value exceeded carrying value by a significant amount.\n \u2022 Equity income increased $27.5 million over fiscal 2015 to $115.0 million. The equity portion of income from WAVE, ClarkDietrich, ArtiFlex and Serviacero exceeded the prior year period by $12.1 million, $11.7 million, $3.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The equity portion of income from ClarkDietrich includes a $4.5 million net legal settlement gain related to successful disparagement litigation against several competitors in an industry trade association. We received distributions of $86.5 million from our unconsolidated affiliates during fiscal 2016. For additional financial information regarding our unconsolidated affiliates, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note B - Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n \u2022 Net sales decreased $71.1 million from fiscal 2015 due to declines in market demand in most lines of business combined with the impact of the January 2015 sale of the assets of Advanced Component Technologies, Inc. and the September 2015 closure of the Florence, South Carolina facility. \n long-lived assets in Engineered Cabs. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note C - Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOur business is cyclical and cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate during the year and from year to year due to economic and industry conditions. We rely on cash and short-term borrowings to meet cyclical increases in working capital needs. These needs generally rise during periods of increased economic activity or increasing raw material prices due to higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable. During economic slowdowns, or periods of decreasing raw material costs, working capital needs generally decrease as a result of the reduction of inventories and accounts receivable.\nContractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\n \u2022 Interest expense of $35.8 million was $9.1 million higher than the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to the impact of higher average debt levels and higher average interest rates resulting from an increase in the usage of long-term debt versus short-term debt. For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note G - Debt and Receivables Securitization\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the continued decline of oil prices further reduced the demand for Oil & Gas Equipment products, causing a significant decrease in the long-term cash flow projections of that business. Based on these revised cash flow projections, the Company determined that long-lived assets of two of the facilities with a combined carrying amount of $59.9 million were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of $36.9 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $23.0 million. Fair value was based on expected future cash flows using Level 3 inputs under Accounting Standard Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 820. The cash flows are those expected to be generated by market participants, discounted at an appropriate rate for the risks inherent in those cash flow projections, or 13%. Because of deteriorating market conditions (i.e., rising interest rates and declining marketplace demand), it is possible that our estimate of discounted cash flows may change resulting in the need to adjust our determination of fair value.\n \u2022 Operating loss decreased $77.9 million from fiscal 2015 due primarily to lower impairment and restructuring charges. Excluding the impact of impairment and restructuring charges, the operating loss was $0.9 million lower than fiscal 2015 as a result of lower SG&A expense, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. Fiscal 2016 impairment charges consisted of $3.0 million related to the closure of the Florence, South Carolina facility. Impairment charges in the prior year consisted of $44.9 million for the full write off of goodwill and $39.0 million for other long-lived assets. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note C - Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Other\nOverview\nWe have reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by taxing authorities. It is our policy to record these in income tax expense. While we believe the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are appropriate, we have established the tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge our positions. The tax reserves are analyzed periodically, and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserves, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, and release of administrative guidance or court decisions affecting a particular tax issue.\nInvestment activities are largely discretionary and future investment activities could be reduced significantly or eliminated as economic conditions warrant. We assess acquisition opportunities as they arise, and such opportunities may require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that any such opportunities will arise, that any such acquisitions will be consummated or that any needed additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when required.\nWhile we believe our allowances are adequate, changes in economic conditions, the financial health of customers and bankruptcy settlements could impact our future earnings. If the economic environment and market conditions deteriorate, particularly in the automotive and construction end markets where our exposure is greatest, additional reserves may be required.\n\nMarket & Industry Overview\nOn September 26, 2014, our consolidated joint venture in Turkey, Worthington Aritas, executed a five-year term loan denominated in Euros. As of May 31, 2016, we had borrowed $28.4 million against the facility. The facility bears interest at a variable rate based on EURIBOR. The applicable variable rate was 1.500% at May 31, 2016. On October 15, 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on 60% of the borrowings outstanding under this facility at 2.015% starting on December 26, 2014 through September 26, 2019. Borrowings against the facility are being used for the construction of a new cryogenics manufacturing facility in Turkey.\nOn June 25, 2014, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10,000,000 of our outstanding common shares. An aggregate of 3,500,000 and 2,453,855 common shares were repurchased under this authorization during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. At May 31, 2016, 4,046,145 common shares remained available for repurchase under this authorization.\n \u2022 Net sales increased $209.6 million over fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by the impact of acquisitions ($109.9 million), higher volumes from existing operations ($60.5 million) and higher average selling prices due to product mix ($39.2 million). Excluding the impact of TWB, the mix of direct versus toll tons processed was unchanged from fiscal 2014 at 56% to 44%. \nSegment Operations\n \u2022 Gross margin decreased $10.9 million from fiscal 2015 on lower volume partially offset by an improved pricing spread in Steel Processing and lower manufacturing expenses across many of our businesses. \n \u2022 As of March 1, 2016, the Company reached an agreement with United States Steel Corporation (\u201cU.S. Steel\u201d), its partner in the Worthington Specialty Processing (\u201cWSP\u201d) joint venture, whereby the Company appoints a majority of the WSP Board of Directors, giving the Company effective control over the operations of WSP. As a result, WSP's results have been consolidated within the financial results of Steel Processing since that date, with the minority member's portion of earnings eliminated within earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest. In the periods prior to March 1, 2016, WSP's results had been accounted for under the equity method. As required by the applicable accounting guidance, a pre-tax gain of $6.9 million was recognized for the difference between the fair value of the Company's previously-held ownership interest in WSP and its carrying value at the acquisition date. The gain was recorded in miscellaneous income, below operating income. The ownership percentages in WSP remained unchanged at 51% Worthington and 49% U.S. Steel. \nIn March 2016, amended accounting guidance was issued regarding derivatives instruments designated as hedging instruments. The amended guidance clarifies that a change in the counterparty to such a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the change may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\n \u2022 SG&A expense decreased $4.5 million from fiscal 2014 driven by lower profit sharing and bonus expense partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. In addition, the prior year period included a net pre-tax gain of $4.0 million for the favorable settlement of a legal dispute. \n \u2022 Net sales decreased $156.5 million from fiscal 2015 on lower volume, particularly in the Oil & Gas Equipment business where volumes decreased 64%. Volumes in the current fiscal year were also negatively impacted by the May 2015 disposition of our high-pressure cylinders business in Mississippi, which generated sales of $26.8 million in the prior year. \nInventory Valuation: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method for all inventories. This assessment requires the use of significant estimates to determine replacement cost, cost to complete, normal profit margin and the ultimate selling price of the inventory. No lower of cost or market adjustment was recorded in fiscal 2016. Due to a decline in steel prices in fiscal 2015, the replacement cost of our inventory was lower than what was reflected in our records at May 31, 2015. Accordingly, we recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of $1.7 million at May 31, 2015 to reflect this lower value. The entire amount related to our Steel Processing operating segment and was recorded in cost of goods sold. We believe our inventories were valued appropriately as of May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015.\n \u2022 Net sales decreased $302.0 million from fiscal 2015 as lower average steel prices led to lower average selling prices, reducing net sales by approximately $260.5 million. The remaining decrease in net sales was due to the closure of the Company's stainless steel business, PSM, in the current year, partially offset by contributions from recent acquisitions. The mix of direct versus toll tons processed was 58% to 42% compared to 59% to 41% in fiscal 2015. \nIntroduction\n \u2022 Income tax expense decreased $31.5 million from fiscal 2014 on lower earnings and an approximately $5.3 million benefit related to foreign tax credits, offset partially by favorable tax adjustments recorded in the prior year including $7.1 million associated with the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in TWB, $2.3 million associated with the write off of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, and $2.2 million of research and development credits.  Fiscal 2015 income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate attributable to controlling interest of 25.1% vs. 27.5% in fiscal 2014. The 25.1% rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of benefits from the qualified production activities deduction and the benefit related to foreign tax credits, offset partially by state and local income taxes. For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note L - Income Taxes\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to our valuation of receivables, inventories, intangible assets, accrued liabilities, income and other tax accruals and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe\nIn July 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued regarding the measurement of inventory. The amended guidance requires that inventory accounted for under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, where net realizable value represents the estimated selling price of inventory in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amended guidance has no impact on inventory accounted for under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or retail inventory methods. The amended guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe also held equity positions in 12 active joint ventures, which operated 51 manufacturing facilities worldwide, as of May 31, 2016. Six of these joint ventures are consolidated with the equity owned by the other joint venture member(s) shown as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets, and the other joint venture member(s)' portion of net earnings and other comprehensive income shown as net earnings or comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, respectively. The remaining six of these joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n \u2022 On January 15, 2016, the Company acquired the net assets of NetBraze, LLC, a manufacturer of brazing alloys, silver brazing filler metals, solders and fluxes, for $3.4 million. The acquired net assets became part of the Pressure Cylinders operating segment upon closing. \n1 2015/2014 figures based on revised actuals 2 CRU Hot-Rolled Index; period average 3 IHS Global 4 LME Zinc; period average 5 NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas; period average 6 Energy Information Administration; period average\n related to the Company's 60%-owned consolidated joint venture in India, $3.2 million related to the Company's aluminum high-pressure cylinder business in New Albany, Mississippi, and $2.3 million for the partial impairment of intangible assets related to our dHybrid joint venture. Impairment charges in the prior year consisted primarily of $19.0 million related to the Company's 60%-owned consolidated joint venture in India and $11.6 million related to the write off of certain trade name intangible assets as a result of a re-branding initiative. Restructuring expense of $6.4 million consisted primarily of employee severance related to workforce reductions in our Oil & Gas Equipment businesses ($2.2 million) and a net loss on the sale of the Company's aluminum high-pressure cylinder business in New Albany, Mississippi ($3.3 million). \n \u2022 Operating loss decreased $2.8 million from fiscal 2014. The improvement resulted from lower losses within Construction Services partially offset by impairment charges of $1.2 million related to the military construction business.  Liquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 During fiscal 2016, we repurchased a total of 3,500,000 common shares for $99.8 million at an average price of $28.53. \nWe maintain a $500.0 million multi-year revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with a group of lenders that matures in April 2020. Borrowings under the Credit Facility typically have maturities of less than one year and given that our intention has been to repay them within a year, they have been classified as short-term borrowings within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. However, we can also extend the term of amounts borrowed by renewing these borrowings for the term of the Credit Facility. We have the option to borrow at rates equal to an applicable margin over the LIBOR, Prime or Fed Funds rates. The applicable margin is determined by our credit rating. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at May 31, 2016.\n \u2022 Forfeitures - The Company has elected to continue to estimate the number of awards expected to vest, as permitted by the amended accounting guidance, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur. \nThe critical accounting policies discussed herein are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP, with a lesser need for our judgment in their application. There are also areas in which our judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves: We are largely self-insured with respect to workers' compensation, general and automobile liability, property damage, employee medical claims and other potential losses. In order to reduce risk and better manage our overall loss exposure, we purchase stop-loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts. We maintain reserves for the estimated cost to settle open claims, which includes estimates of legal costs expected to be incurred, as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on actuarial valuations that take into consideration the historical average claim volume, the average cost for settled claims, current trends in claim costs, changes in our business and workforce, general economic factors and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimated reserves for these liabilities could be affected if future occurrences and claims differ from assumptions used and historical trends. Facility consolidations, a focus on safety initiatives and an emphasis on property loss prevention and product quality have resulted in an improvement in our loss history and the related assumptions used to analyze many of the current self-insurance reserves. We will continue to review these reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review is warranted.\nThe market price of hot-rolled steel is one of the most significant factors impacting our selling prices and operating results. When steel prices fall, we typically have higher-priced material flowing through cost of goods sold, while selling prices compress to what the market will bear, negatively impacting our results. On the other hand, in a rising price environment, our results are generally favorably impacted, as lower-priced material purchased in previous periods flows through cost of goods sold, while our selling prices increase at a faster pace to cover current replacement costs.\nSubstantially all of the net sales of our Pressure Cylinders operating segment, and approximately 25% and 48% of the net sales of our Steel Processing and Engineered Cabs operating segments, respectively, are to other markets such as consumer products, industrial, lawn and garden, agriculture, oil and gas equipment, heavy truck, mining, forestry and appliance. Given the many different products that make up these net sales and the wide variety of end markets, it is very difficult to detail the key market indicators that drive this portion of our business. However, we believe that the trend in U.S. GDP growth is a good economic indicator for analyzing these operating segments.\nApproximately 10% of the net sales of our Steel Processing operating segment, 52% of the net sales of our Engineered Cabs operating segment and substantially all of the net sales of our Construction Services operating segment are to the construction market. The construction market is also the predominant end market for two of our unconsolidated joint ventures: WAVE and ClarkDietrich. While the market price of steel significantly impacts these businesses, there are other key indicators that are meaningful in analyzing construction market demand, including U.S. gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d), the Dodge Index of construction contracts and, in the case of ClarkDietrich, trends in the relative price of framing lumber and steel.\nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Pressure Cylinders operating segment for the periods indicated:\nThe automotive industry is one of the largest consumers of flat-rolled steel, and thus the largest end market for our Steel Processing operating segment. Approximately 65% of the net sales of our Steel Processing operating segment are to the automotive market. North American vehicle production, primarily by FCA US, Ford and General Motors (the \u201cDetroit Three automakers\u201d), has a considerable impact on the activity within this operating segment. The majority of the net sales of three of our unconsolidated joint ventures are also to the automotive end market.\nSteel Processing\nInvesting activities\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Engineered Cabs operating segment for the periods indicated:\n We believe we have access to adequate resources to meet our needs for normal operating costs, capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividend payments and working capital for our existing businesses. These resources include cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and unused lines of credit. We also believe we have adequate access to the financial markets to allow us to be in a position to sell long-term debt or equity securities. However, uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets may impact our ability to access capital and the terms under which we can do so.\nIn April 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that such costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability itself. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. Retrospective application to prior periods is required. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nWorthington Industries, Inc. is a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Ohio (individually, the \u201cRegistrant\u201d or \u201cWorthington Industries\u201d or, collectively with the subsidiaries of Worthington Industries, Inc., \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cWorthington\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). Founded in 1955, Worthington is primarily a diversified metals manufacturing company, focused on value-added steel processing and manufactured metal products. Our manufactured metal products include: pressure cylinders for liquefied petroleum gas (\u201cLPG\u201d), compressed natural gas (\u201cCNG\u201d), oxygen, refrigerant and other industrial gas storage; hand torches and filled hand torch cylinders; propane-filled camping cylinders; helium-filled balloon kits; steel and fiberglass tanks and processing equipment primarily for the oil and gas industry; cryogenic pressure vessels for liquefied natural gas (\u201cLNG\u201d) and other gas storage applications; engineered cabs and operator stations and cab components; and, through joint ventures, suspension grid systems for concealed and lay-in panel ceilings; laser welded blanks; light gauge steel framing for commercial and residential construction; and current and past model automotive service stampings. Our number one goal is to increase shareholder value, which we seek to accomplish by optimizing existing operations, developing and commercializing new products and applications, and pursuing strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company committed to a plan to sell its 60% ownership interest in Worthington Nitin Cylinders, a consolidated joint venture in India, and PSM, a stainless steel business. Accordingly, at May 31, 2014, the net assets of these businesses were recorded as assets held for sale at the lower of their fair values or net book values, less selling costs. During the first half of fiscal 2015, changes in facts and circumstances related to these businesses indicated that the Company needed to reassess the fair value of these assets. As a result, additional impairment charges of $6.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, were recorded.\n\n Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nShort-term borrowings at May 31, 2016, consisted of an aggregate of $2.6 million outstanding under various credit facilities maintained by our consolidated joint venture, Worthington Aritas.\nResults of Operations\nCertain other commodities, such as zinc, natural gas and diesel fuel, represent a significant portion of our cost of goods sold, both directly through our plant operations and indirectly through transportation and freight expense.\nWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. However, as of May 31, 2016, we were party to an operating lease for an aircraft in which we have guaranteed a residual value at the termination of the lease. The maximum obligation under the terms of this guarantee was approximately $10.5 million at May 31, 2016. Based on current facts and circumstances, we have estimated the likelihood of payment pursuant to this guarantee, and determined that the fair value of our obligation based on the likely outcome is not material.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company concluded that an interim impairment test of the goodwill of its Engineered Cabs reporting unit was necessary. Prior to conducting the goodwill impairment test, the Company first evaluated the other long-lived assets of the Engineered Cabs reporting unit for recoverability. Recoverability was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sums of the undiscounted future cash flows for the customer relationship intangible asset and the property, plant and equipment of the Florence, South Carolina facility were less than their respective carrying values. As a result, these assets were written down to their respective fair values, resulting in impairment charges of $22.4 million for the customer relationship intangible asset and $14.3 million for the property, plant and equipment of the Florence asset group during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As noted above, an additional impairment charge related to the Florence asset group was later recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nWe currently have no material contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. Dividends are declared at the discretion of the Board. The Board reviews the dividend quarterly and establishes the dividend rate based upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, current and projected cash flows, business prospects and other relevant factors. While we have paid a dividend every quarter since becoming a public company in 1968, there is no guarantee that payments will continue in the future.\n \u2022 Miscellaneous income increased $10.5 million over fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily the result of a $6.9 million pre-tax gain related to the consolidation of WSP. The gain represents the difference between the fair value of the Company's previously-held ownership interest in WSP and its carrying value at the acquisition date. For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note O - Acquisitions\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Steel Processing operating segment for the periods indicated:\nImpairment of Indefinite-Lived Long-Lived Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may be present. Application of goodwill impairment testing involves judgment, including but not limited to, the identification of reporting units and estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. With the exception of Pressure Cylinders, we test goodwill at the operating segment level as we have determined that the characteristics of the reporting units within each operating segment are similar and allow for their aggregation in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. For our Pressure Cylinders operating segment, the Oil & Gas Equipment business has been treated as a separate reporting unit since the second quarter of fiscal 2016.\n \u2022 Net sales decreased $564.5 million from fiscal 2015. The decrease was driven by lower average selling prices in Steel Processing due to the market price of steel and by lower volume in Pressure Cylinders and Engineered Cabs, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. \nU.S. GDP growth rate trends are generally indicative of the strength in demand and, in many cases, pricing for our products. A year-over-year increase in U.S. GDP growth rates is indicative of a stronger economy, which generally increases demand and pricing for our products. Conversely, decreasing U.S. GDP growth rates generally indicate a weaker economy. Changes in U.S. GDP growth rates can also signal changes in conversion costs related to production and in selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expense.\nIn February 2015, amended accounting guidance was issued that revised consolidation requirements in order to provide financial statement users with a more useful presentation of an entity's economic and operational results. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adopton is permitted, and the amendments may be applied using either a retrospective or modified retrospective approach. We do not expect the adoption of this amended accounting guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\n \u2022 Interest expense of $31.7 million was $4.1 million lower than the prior fiscal year. The decrease was driven by lower average debt levels as a result of a decrease in working capital requirements due to the lower average market price of steel. For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note G - Debt and Receivables Securitization\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nPressure Cylinders\nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Engineered Cabs operating segment for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 Net sales increased $257.8 million over fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by the impact of acquisitions ($185.6 million) and higher volumes from existing operations ($123.7 million), partially offset by lower average selling prices ($51.5 million). \nCapital expenditures reflect cash used for investment in property, plant and equipment and are presented below by reportable business segment (this information excludes cash flows related to acquisition and divestiture activity):\nInflation\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2016, management finalized its plan to close the Engineered Cabs facility in Florence, South Carolina and transfer the majority of the business to the Engineered Cabs facility in Greeneville, Tennessee. Under the plan, certain machinery and equipment was transferred to the Greeneville facility to support higher volume requirements. Management reevaluated the recoverability of the remaining assets and determined that long-lived assets with a carrying value of $4.1 million were impaired. As a result, these long-lived assets were written down to their estimated fair value of $1.1 million resulting in an impairment charge of $3.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company ceased production at the Florence facility on September 30, 2015.\nNo single customer contributed more than 10% of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2016. While our automotive business is largely driven by the production schedules of the Detroit Three automakers, our customer base is much broader and includes other domestic manufacturers and many of their suppliers. During fiscal 2016, vehicle production for the Detroit Three automakers was up 3%. North American vehicle production as a whole also increased 3%.\nThe Other category includes the Construction Services and WEI operating segments, which do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure. Certain income and expense items not allocated to our operating segments are also included in the Other category. The following table presents a summary of operating results for the Other category for the periods indicated:\nRecent Business Developments\n \u2022 Impairment charges of $100.1 million consisted primarily of $83.9 million related to Engineered Cabs, including $44.9 million for the full write off of goodwill. Impairment charges in the comparable prior year period consisted primarily of $30.7 million related to the write off of certain trade name intangible assets as a result of a re-branding initiative and $19.0 million related to the Company's 60%-owned consolidated joint venture in India. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note C - Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nWe performed our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value; therefore, no additional impairment charges were recognized.\nItem 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of May 31, 2016. These commercial commitments are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet.\nOperating activities\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2015, management committed to a plan to sell the assets of the Advanced Component Technologies, Inc. business within Engineered Cabs. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the net assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.4 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company completed the sale of these assets and recognized a gain of $332,000.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSteel Processing\nAs a result of the impairment of the Oil & Gas Equipment assets noted above, the Company also performed an impairment review of the goodwill of the Pressure Cylinders reporting unit during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company first assessed the reporting unit structure and determined that it was no longer appropriate to aggregate the Oil & Gas Equipment component with the rest of Pressure Cylinders for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. This determination was driven by changes in the economic characteristics of the Oil & Gas Equipment business as a result of sustained low oil prices, which now indicate that the risk profile and prospects for growth and profitability of the Oil & Gas Equipment component are no\n \u2022 Income tax increased $33.2 million over fiscal 2015 due to higher earnings and an approximately $5.3 million benefit related to foreign tax credits recorded in the prior year, partially offset by a $3.2 million tax benefit representing excess tax benefits from share-based payment awards recorded in income tax expense resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance as described in \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Standards\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Fiscal 2016 income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate attributable to controlling interest of 29.1% vs. 25.1% in fiscal 2015. The 29.1% rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower tax rates on foreign income, benefits from the qualified production activities deduction, and the adoption of the new accounting guidance described above with respect to share-based payment awards, offset partially by state and local income taxes. For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note L - Income Taxes\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental\nIn February 2016, amended accounting guidance was issued that replaces most existing lease accounting guidance under U.S. GAAP. Among other changes, the amended guidance requires that lease assets and liabilities be recognized on the balance sheet by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the change is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. We are in the process of evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations, and we have not determined the effect of the amended guidance on our ongoing financial reporting.\nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Steel Processing operating segment for the periods indicated:\n Fiscal 2016 net earnings attributable to controlling interest increased $66.9 million over fiscal 2015. Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nPrior to conducting the goodwill impairment test, the Company first evaluated the other long-lived assets of the Engineered Cabs reporting unit for recoverability. Recoverability was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows for both the customer relationship intangible asset and the property, plant and equipment of the Florence facility were less than their respective carrying values. As a result, these assets were written down to their respective fair values, resulting in impairment charges of $22.4 million for the customer relationship intangible asset and $14.3 million for the property, plant and equipment of the Florence asset group during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.\nEquity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates (\u201cequity income\u201d) was up 31% in fiscal 2016 to $115.0 million on higher contributions from all of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Strong automotive and construction markets and lower steel costs have benefited these businesses. We received distributions of $86.5 million from our unconsolidated affiliates during fiscal 2016.\nWe review our receivables on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are properly valued and collectible. Based on this review, we believe our related reserves are appropriate. The reserve for doubtful accounts increased approximately $1.5 million during fiscal 2016 to $4.6 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $413.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $214.4 million in fiscal 2015. The $198.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by declining working capital levels as a result of lower average steel prices and higher earnings.\nThe following table presents a summary of operating results for our Pressure Cylinders operating segment for the periods indicated:\nAccounting for Derivatives and Other Contracts at Fair Value: We use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign currency and interest rates. Fair values for these contracts are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different assumptions could affect the estimated fair values.\nDividend Policy\nOn June 29, 2011, the Board of Worthington Industries, Inc. authorized the repurchase of up to 10,000,000 of our outstanding common shares of which none remained available for repurchase at May 31, 2016. During fiscal 2015, 1,722,332 common shares were repurchased under this authorization.\n \u2022 Net sales increased $73.0 million over fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by recent acquisitions ($81.3 million) and an increase in Oil & Gas Equipment sales, partially offset by lower industrial products volume and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on European sales. \n Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\n \u2022 Operating income increased $3.3 million over fiscal 2015. The increase was driven by an improved pricing spread and lower inventory holding losses. Higher SG&A expense, driven by the impact of acquisitions and higher profit sharing and bonus expense, combined with current period restructuring activities partially offset the overall increase in operating income. Restructuring and other expense in the current period consisted primarily of costs related to the closure of PSM ($7.0 million), which were partially offset by a net gain related to the disposal of the remaining fixed assets of our legacy Baltimore steel processing facility ($3.0 million). The $3.1 million impairment charge in the prior year period related to the closure of the PSM facility. \n \u2022 Net sales decreased $17.3 million from fiscal 2014. The decrease was driven by declines in both the Construction Services and WEI businesses. \nto be reasonable under the circumstances. These results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect our significant judgments and uncertainties that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Although actual results historically have not deviated significantly from those determined using our estimates, as discussed below, our financial position or results of operations could be materially different if we were to report under different conditions or to use different assumptions in the application of such policies. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us, as these are the primary areas where financial information is subject to our estimates, assumptions and judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents the average quarterly market price per ton of hot-rolled steel during fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014:\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of May 31, 2016. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n \u2022 Restructuring and other expense of $7.2 million consisted of $7.0 million in net restructuring charges related to the ongoing closure of the Company's stainless steel business, Precision Specialty Metals, Inc. (\u201cPSM\u201d), $1.8 million of employee severance related to workforce reduction in Oil & Gas Equipment and $3.2 million of facility exit costs related to the closure of the Florence, South Carolina facility in Engineered Cabs. A net gain of $6.9 million on asset disposals partially offset the impact of these items. The net gain was related primarily to the disposal of the remaining fixed assets of our legacy Baltimore steel processing facility ($3.0 million), the sale of the Worthington Nitin Cylinders joint venture in India ($1.9 million), and the sale of real estate in our legacy metal framing business ($1.5 million). For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note D - Restructuring and Other Expense\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nFiscal 2015: During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we determined that indicators of impairment were present with regard to intangible assets related to our CNG fuel systems joint venture, dHybrid. Recoverability of the identified asset group was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sum of these undiscounted future cash flows was less than the net book value of the asset group. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the intangible assets were written down to their fair value, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.3 million.\ntesting involves a comparison of the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group to its respective carrying amount. If the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment, if any, to be recognized. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds fair value.\nLong-term debt - Our senior unsecured long-term debt is rated \u201cinvestment grade\u201d by both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. We typically use the net proceeds from long-term debt for acquisitions, refinancing of outstanding debt, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. As of May 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our long-term financial debt covenants. Our long-term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions.\n \u2022 Statement of Cash Flows Presentation - The amended accounting guidance requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Previously, excess tax benefits were presented as a cash inflow from financing activities and cash outflow from operating activities. The Company has elected to present these changes on a prospective basis and therefore prior periods have not been adjusted to conform with the current presentation.  In June 2016, amended accounting guidance was issued related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The amended guidance changes the impairment model for most financial assets to require measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are in the process of evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations, and we have not determined the effect of the amended guidance on our ongoing financial reporting.\n * Mississippi, an industrial gas facility, was sold in May 2015. It has been identified separately so as not to distort the Industrial Products comparisons as the products previously produced at the Mississippi facility have been discontinued.  Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nShort-term borrowings - Our short-term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions. We were in compliance with our short-term financial debt covenants at May 31, 2016.\nWe maintain a $100.0 million revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility (the \u201cAR Facility\u201d) that expires in January 2018 and was available throughout fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the AR Facility, certain of our subsidiaries sell their accounts receivable without recourse, on a revolving basis, to Worthington Receivables Corporation (\u201cWRC\u201d), a wholly-owned, consolidated, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary. In turn, WRC may sell without recourse, on a revolving basis, up to $100.0 million of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multi-seller, asset-backed commercial paper conduit (the \u201cConduit\u201d). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of A1/P1 commercial paper. We retain an undivided interest in this pool and are subject to risk of loss based on the collectability of the receivables from this retained interest. Because the amount eligible to be sold excludes receivables more than 90 days past due, receivables offset by an allowance for doubtful accounts due to bankruptcy or other cause, concentrations over certain limits with specific customers and certain reserve amounts, we believe additional risk of loss is minimal. The book value of the retained portion of the pool of accounts receivable approximates fair value. As of May 31, 2016, no undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable had been sold.\n \u2022 Impairment charges of $26.0 million in fiscal 2016 consisted of $23.0 million related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets in our Oil & Gas Equipment business and $3.0 million related to the September 30, 2015 closure of the Engineered Cabs facility in Florence, South Carolina. Impairment charges in the prior year related primarily to the impairment of goodwill and other \nWe do not believe that compliance with environmental laws has or will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, future results of operations or financial position or competitive position.\nAlso during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we determined that indicators of impairment were present at the Company's aluminum high-pressure cylinder business in New Albany, Mississippi, and at the Company's military construction business due to current and projected operating losses. Recoverability of the identified asset groups was tested using future cash flow projections based on management's long-range estimates of market conditions. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows was less than the net book value of the asset groups. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the net assets were written down to their fair values, resulting in impairment charges of $3.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\n \u2022 Operating income of $1.0 million represents a $10.0 million improvement from the $9.0 million operating loss recognized in fiscal 2015. The improvement resulted from lower losses within Construction Services, which the Company is exiting, and a net gain within restructuring and other income related to the sale of real estate in our legacy metal framing business.  Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nConsolidated Operations\nNet cash used by financing activities was $233.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $170.3 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2016, we paid $99.8 million to repurchase 3,500,000 of our common shares, reduced short-term borrowings by $85.8 million, and paid dividends of $47.2 million on our common shares.\n\nIn May 2014, amended accounting guidance was issued that replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. Subsequently, additional guidance was issued on several areas including guidance intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation of principal versus agent considerations and clarifications on the identification of performance obligations and implementation of guidance related to licensing. The amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are in the process of evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. The amended guidance permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the amended guidance on our ongoing financial reporting.\n1 CRU Hot-Rolled Index\nRevenue Recognition: We recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss provided evidence of an arrangement exists, pricing is fixed and determinable and the ability to collect is probable. In circumstances where the collection of payment is not probable at the time of shipment, we defer recognition of revenue until payment is collected. We provide for returns and allowances based on historical experience and current customer activities.\n \u2022 Restructuring expense of $6.5 million consisted primarily of employee severance related to workforce reductions in our Oil & Gas Equipment businesses ($2.2 million) and a net loss on the sale of the Company's aluminum high-pressure cylinder business in New Albany, Mississippi ($3.3 million). For additional information, refer to \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note D - Restructuring and Other Expense\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nEngineered Cabs\n Interest expense on long-term debt is computed by using the fixed rates of interest on the debt, including impacts of the related interest rate hedge. Royalty obligations relate to a trademark license agreement executed in connection with the acquisition of Coleman Cylinders in fiscal 2012. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits of $2.8 million, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the periods of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities and have not included this amount in the contractual cash obligations table above.\n \u2022 Operating income decreased $29.8 million from fiscal 2015 as declines in the Oil & Gas Equipment business more than offset improvements in the Industrial Products and Consumer Products businesses resulting from lower commodity input prices and lower overall manufacturing costs. Impairment charges in the current period related to the partial write-off of certain long-lived assets in the Oil & Gas Equipment business. \nNet cash used by investing activities was $127.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $203.1 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease of $76.1 million was driven primarily by lower acquisition activity in the current year. During fiscal 2016, we spent a combined $34.2 million, net of cash acquired, for the net assets of the CryoScience business of Taylor Wharton and the net assets of NetBraze, LLC. Comparatively, during fiscal 2015, we spent a combined $105.3 million, net of cash acquired, for the net assets of Rome Strip Steel, Midstream Equipment Fabrication, LLC and James Russell Engineering Works, Inc. and our 79.59% interest in dHybrid Systems, LLC. We also made capital expenditures of $97.0 million and received $9.8 million in proceeds from asset sales during fiscal 2016.\n \u2022 Gross margin decreased $29.0 million from fiscal 2014. The decrease was driven by declines in the oil and gas equipment and industrial products end markets in Pressure Cylinders, inventory holding losses in Steel Processing and higher manufacturing expenses, partially offset by contributions from recent acquisitions. \nThe following table presents consolidated operating results for the periods indicated:\nEngineered Cabs\n \u2022 Net sales decreased $7.5 million from fiscal 2014. The decrease was driven by lower tooling revenue from startup programs and the January 2015 sale of the assets of Advanced Component Technologies, Inc. \nImpairment of Definite-Lived Long-Lived Assets: We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Impairment\nSegment Operations\nIncome Taxes: In accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance, we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some, or a portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion of such deferred income tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Other category includes the Construction Services and WEI operating segments, which do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure. Certain income and expense items not allocated to our operating segments are also included in the Other category, including costs associated with our captive insurance company. The following table presents a summary of operating results for the Other category for the periods indicated:\n * Mississippi, an industrial gas facility, was sold in May 2015. It has been identified separately so as not to distort the Industrial Products comparisons as the products previously produced at the Mississippi facility have been discontinued.  Net sales and operating highlights were as follows:\nReceivables: In order to ensure that our receivables are properly valued, we utilize two contra-receivable accounts: returns and allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts. Returns and allowances are used to record estimates of returns or other allowances resulting from quality, delivery, discounts or other issues affecting the value of receivables. This account is estimated based on historical trends and current market conditions, with the offset to net sales.", "item_7_tables": "Table 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

report:\n\n- Net sales decreased $564.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, driven by lower average selling prices in Steel Processing and lower volumes in Pressure Cylinders and Engineered Cabs. \n\n- Operating income increased $61.4 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase was driven by lower impairment and restructuring charges, partially offset by declines in the Oil & Gas Equipment business.\n\n- Net earnings attributable to controlling interest increased $66.9 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, driven by lower impairment charges, higher equity income, and a lower effective tax rate. \n\n- Cash from operations was $413.3 million in fiscal 2016, up from $214.4 million in fiscal 2015, due to declining working capital requirements. \n\n- Capital expenditures were $97.0 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $96.3 million in fiscal 2015.\n\n- 3.5 million common shares were repurchased in fiscal 2016 for $99.8 million. \n\n- Equity income from joint ventures was $115.0 million in fiscal 2016, up 31% from fiscal 2015 on higher contributions from all joint ventures.\n\nThe key drivers were lower steel prices impacting net sales, higher equity income, lower impairment charges, and working capital improvements driving higher cash from operations."}
