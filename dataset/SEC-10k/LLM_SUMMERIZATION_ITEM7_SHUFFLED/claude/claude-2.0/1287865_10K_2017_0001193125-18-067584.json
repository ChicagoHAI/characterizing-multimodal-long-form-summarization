We also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants. We conduct our business operations in one segment. We have healthcare investments in the U.S. and Europe. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 U.S. federal income tax return. Our existing tenants are, and our prospective tenants will generally be, healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations. We offer financing for these operators' real estate through 100% lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long-term basis ranging from 10 to 15 years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers. We also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases. Our existing portfolio's minimum escalators range from 0.5% to 4%, while less than 3% of our properties do not have an escalator. Most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases. In addition to rent or mortgage interest, our leases and loans typically require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility. Some leases also may require our tenants to pay percentage rents, which are based on the tenant's revenues from their operations. Finally, we may acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in the tenant's income or loss.\nWe selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our TRSs, which the operators use for acquisitions and working capital. We consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons: (1) it provides opportunities to make income-earning investments that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise, and (2) by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators, we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of, and financing sources for, healthcare facilities.\nAt December 31, 2017, our portfolio consisted of 275 properties leased or loaned to 31 operators, of which three are under development and 14 are in the form of mortgage loans.\n2017 Highlights\nIn 2017, we invested or committed to invest approximately $2.2 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and scale of our healthcare portfolio, while expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. and extending our lease and mortgage loan maturity schedule. Furthermore, we strategically sold an asset for proceeds totaling $64 million, raised $548 million in proceeds from a successful equity offering, and refinanced approximately $0.6 billion of debt in order to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce interest rates, and fund acquisitions. Finally, we increased our dividend to $0.24 per share per quarter in 2017 - the third year in a row for such an increase.\nA summary of our 2017 highlights is as follows:\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Acquired real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $2.2 billion as noted below: </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Acquired 17 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and one acute care hospital in Germany for a combined purchase price of \u0080274 million.

We believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of our revenues, credit losses, fair values (either as part of a purchase price allocation, impairment analysis or in valuing certain of our equity investments), periodic depreciation of our real estate assets, and stock compensation expense, along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results, have significant effects on our financial statements. Each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments. We rely on our experience, collect historical and current market data, and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. See Note 2 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policies and recent accounting developments. Our accounting estimates include the following:\nRevenue Recognition: We receive income from operating leases based on the fixed, minimum required rents (base rents) per the lease agreements. Rent revenue from base rents is recorded on the straight-line method over the terms of the related lease agreements for new leases and the remaining terms of existing leases for those acquired as part of a property acquisition. The straight-line method records the periodic average amount of base rent earned over the term of a lease, taking into account contractual rent adjustments over the lease term. The straight-line method typically has the effect of recording more rent revenue from a lease than a tenant is required to pay early in the term of the lease. During the later parts of a lease term, this effect reverses with less rent revenue recorded than a tenant is required to pay. Rent revenue, as recorded on the straight-line method, in the consolidated statements of income is presented as two amounts: rent billed revenue and straight-line revenue. Rent billed revenue is the amount of base rent actually billed to the customer each period as required by the lease. Straight-line rent revenue is the difference between rent revenue earned based on the straight-line method and the amount recorded as rent billed revenue. We record the difference between base rent revenues earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements, as applicable, as an increase or decrease to straight-line rent receivable.\nWe also receive additional rent (contingent rent) under some leases based on increases in CPI or where CPI exceeds the annual minimum percentage increase as stipulated in the lease. Contingent rents are recorded as rent billed revenue in the period earned.\nWe use direct financing lease (\u201cDFL\u201d) accounting to record rent on certain leases deemed to be financing leases, per accounting rules, rather than operating leases. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectability of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unearned income.\nWe begin recording base rent income from our development projects when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility, which may be different from the stated start date of the lease. Also, during construction of our development projects, we are generally entitled to accrue rent based on the cost paid during the construction period (construction period rent). We accrue construction period rent as a receivable with a\ncorresponding offset to deferred revenue during the construction period. When the lessee takes physical possession of the facility, we begin recognizing the deferred construction period revenue on the straight-line method over the remaining term of the lease.\nWe receive interest income from our tenants/borrowers on mortgage loans, working capital loans, and other long-term loans. Interest income from these loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal outstanding and terms of the loans.\nCommitment fees received from lessee for development and leasing services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the initial term of a lease to produce a constant effective yield on the lease (interest method). Commitment and origination fees from lending services are also recorded as deferred revenue initially and recognized as income over the life of the loan using the interest method.\nInvestments in Real Estate: We maintain our investments in real estate at cost, and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. While our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility, to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance, we expense those costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the weighted average useful life of approximately 39.1 years for buildings and improvements.\nWhen circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments, we review the recoverability of the facility's carrying value. The review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, from the facility's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends, and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis, such as was the case with our Monroe and Bucks facilities in 2014, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility. We do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at December 31, 2017; however, given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken.\nAcquired Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation: For properties acquired for leasing purposes, we currently account for such acquisitions based on business combination accounting rules. We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we may utilize a number of sources, including available real estate broker data, independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, internal data from previous acquisitions or developments, and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values, if any, for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. We amortize any resulting capitalized above-market lease values as a reduction of rental income over lease term. We amortize any resulting capitalized below-market lease values as an increase to rental income over the lease term. Because our strategy to a large degree involves the origination and acquisition of long-term lease arrangements at market rates with independent parties, we do not expect the above-market and below-market in-place lease values to be significant for many of our transactions.\nWe measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with new or in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property\nvalued as if vacant when acquired. Management's estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which we expect to be about six months (based on experience) depending on specific local market conditions. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal costs, and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction.\nOther intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values, which are based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant's lease and our overall relationship with that tenant. Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement, among other factors. At December 31, 2017, we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles.\nWe amortize the value of lease intangibles to expense over the term of the respective leases, which have a weighted average useful life of 26.5 years at December 31, 2017. If a lease is terminated, the unamortized portion of the lease intangible is charged to expense as was the case with our Twelve Oaks property in 2015.\nLosses from Rent Receivables: For all leases, we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including, but not limited to: admission levels and surgery/procedure volumes by type; current operating margins; ratio of our tenants' operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs; trends in revenue, cash collections, and patient mix; and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations on tenants' profitability and liquidity.\nLosses from Operating Lease Receivables: We utilize the information above along with the tenants' payment and default history in evaluating (on a property-by-property basis) whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding rent receivables is needed. A provision for losses on rent receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full. The provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral, if any.\nLosses on DFL Receivables: Allowances are established for DFLs based upon an estimate of probable losses on a property-by-property basis. DFLs are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the lease. Like operating lease receivables, the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's overall financial condition; economic resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the DFL's effective interest rate, fair value of collateral, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. DFLs are placed on non-accrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. If on non-accrual status, we generally account for the DFLs on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash.\nLoans: Loans consist of mortgage loans, working capital loans and other long-term loans. Mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property. Working capital and other long-term loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees. We record loans at cost. We evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal on a loan-by-loan basis (using the same process as we do\nfor assessing the collectability of rents as discussed above) to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the allowance is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to either the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the loans effective interest rate or to the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent.\nStock-Based Compensation: During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recorded $9.9 million, $7.9 million, and $11.1 million, respectively, of expense for share-based compensation related to grants of restricted common stock and other stock-based awards. Starting in 2010, we granted annual performance-based restricted share awards that vest based on the achievement of certain market conditions as defined by the accounting rules. Typical market conditions for our awards are based on our total shareholder return (factoring in stock price appreciation and dividends paid) including comparisons of our total shareholder returns to an index of other REIT stocks. Because these awards are earned based on the achievement of these market conditions, we must initially evaluate and estimate the probability of achieving these market conditions in order to determine the fair value of the award and over what period we should recognize stock compensation expense. Because of the complexities inherently involved with these awards, we work with an independent consultant to assist us in modeling both the value of the award and the various periods over which each tranche of an award will be earned. We use what is termed a Monte Carlo simulation model, which determines a value and earnings periods based on multiple outcomes and their probabilities. We record expense over the expected or derived vesting periods using the calculated value of the awards. We record expense over these vesting periods even though the awards have not yet been earned and, in fact, may never be earned - such as was the case with our 2015 performance awards in which 348,938 shares were forfeited because the related market conditions were not achieved for the period of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. If awards vest faster than our original estimate, we will record a catch-up of expense.\nFair Value Option Election: We elected to account for certain investments acquired on February 29, 2012, as part of the Ernest transaction, using the fair value option method, which means we mark these investments to fair market value on a recurring basis. Any changes in the fair value of these investments are non-cash adjustments that will not impact our financial condition or cash flows unless we decided to liquidate these investments.\nThese investments include the following at December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset (Liability)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Original Cost </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity investment and other loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118,354 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>229,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>233,354 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> We measure the estimated fair value of most of these investments utilizing Level 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Under current accounting guidance, Level 3 represents fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nOur mortgage and acquisition loans with Ernest are recorded at fair value based on Level 2 inputs by discounting the estimated cash flows using the market rates which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and the same remaining maturities. Our equity investment in Ernest is recorded at fair value based on Level 3 inputs, by using a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates of our investee such as projected revenue and expenses and appropriate consideration of the underlying risk profile of the forecasted assumptions associated with the investee. We classify the equity investment as Level 3, as we use certain unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement, and the valuation requires management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. For the cash flow\nmodel, our observable inputs include use of a capitalization rate, discount rate (which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital), and market interest rates, and our unobservable input includes an adjustment for a marketability discount (\u201cDLOM\u201d) on our equity investment of 40% at December 31, 2017.\nIn regards to the underlying projection of revenues and expenses used in the discounted cash flow model, such projections are provided by Ernest. However, we will modify such projections (including underlying assumptions used) as needed based on our review and analysis of their historical results, meetings with key members of management, and our understanding of trends and developments within the healthcare industry.\nIn arriving at the DLOM, we started with a DLOM range based on the results of studies supporting valuation discounts for other transactions or structures without a public market. To select the appropriate DLOM within the range, we then considered many qualitative factors including the percent of control, the nature of the underlying investee's business along with our rights as an investor pursuant to the operating agreement, the size of investment, expected holding period, number of shareholders, access to capital marketplace, etc. To illustrate the effect of movements in the DLOM, we performed a sensitivity analysis below by using basis point variations (dollars in thousands):\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basis Point\nChange in\nMarketability Discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Increase (Decrease)\nIn Fair Value </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> - 100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Because the fair value of Ernest investments noted above is below our original cost, we recognized an unrealized loss in 2017. No unrealized gain/loss on the Ernest investments were recorded in previous years.\nIn 2015, we held an equity investment in Capella (now RCCH) similar to our Ernest equity investment. We accounted for this investment under the fair value option election as well. We recorded no unrealized gain/loss on this investment in 2015 and through April 2016. In April 2016, we sold our Capella equity investment at cost resulting in no recognized gain/loss.\nPrinciples of Consolidation: Property holding entities and other subsidiaries of which we own 100% of the equity or have a controlling financial interest evidenced by ownership of a majority voting interest are consolidated. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. For entities in which we own less than 100% of the equity interest, we consolidate the property if we have the direct or indirect ability to control the entities' activities based upon the terms of the respective entities' ownership agreements. For these entities, we record a non-controlling interest representing equity held by non-controlling interests.\nWe continually evaluate all of our transactions and investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a variable interest entity. If we determine that we have a variable interest in a variable interest entity, we then evaluate if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether we have the ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. We consolidate each variable interest entity in which we, by virtue of or transactions with our investments in the entity, are considered to be the primary beneficiary. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entity in which we hold a variable interest (such as Ernest) because we do not control the activities (such as the day-to-day operations of the hospital) that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities.\nDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\nThe following

In addition, the credit agreement governing our Credit Facility limits the amount of dividends we can pay to 95% of normalized adjusted funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, on a rolling four quarter basis. The indentures governing our senior unsecured notes also limit the amount of dividends we can pay based on the sum of 95% of funds from operations, proceeds of equity issuances and certain other net cash proceeds. Finally, our senior unsecured notes require us to maintain total unencumbered assets (as defined in the related indenture) of not less than 150% of our unsecured indebtedness.\nIn addition to these restrictions, the Credit Facility contains customary financial and operating covenants, including covenants relating to our total leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, secured leverage ratio, unsecured leverage ratio, consolidated adjusted net worth, and unsecured interest coverage ratio. This facility also contains customary events of default, including among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, material inaccuracy of representations and failure to comply with our covenants. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the facility, the entire outstanding balance may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all such financial and operating covenants.\nIn order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains. See section titled \u201cDistribution Policy\u201d within this Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our dividend policy along with the historical dividends paid on a per share basis.\nShort-term Liquidity Requirements:\nAs of February 28, 2018, we have no debt principal payments due in 2018 - see debt maturity schedule below. At February 28, 2018, our availability under our revolving credit facility plus cash on-hand approximated $0.6 billion. We believe this liquidity along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest and availability under our at-the-market equity program is sufficient to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, our purchase obligations as disclosed in the \u201cContractual Obligations\u201d schedule earlier, and dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements for the next twelve months.\nWe expect to lower our outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility, improve our leverage metrics, and reduce our tenant concentration in Steward during 2018. We expect to accomplish this by entering into joint venture arrangements, and/or completing strategic property sales, among other alternatives. However, no assurance can be made that such transactions will be available to us or that our plans will be successful.\nLong-term Liquidity Requirements:\nAs of February 28, 2018, we have no debt principal payments due between now and January 2021 when our revolving credit facility comes due (which can be extended by one year). With our liquidity as of February 28, 2018 of approximately $0.6 billion, along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest and availability under our at-the-market equity program, we believe we have the liquidity available for us to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements, and our purchase obligations included in the \u201cContractual Obligations\u201d schedule for the foreseeable future.\nHowever, in order to fund our investment strategies and to fund debt maturities coming due in later years, we believe the following sources of capital are generally available in the market and we may access one or a combination of them:\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>entering into joint venture arrangements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>proceeds from strategic property sales; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>sale of equity securities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>amending or entering into new bank term loans; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>issuing of new USD or EUR denominated debt securities, including senior unsecured notes; and/or </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>placing new secured loans on real estate located in the U.S. and/or Europe. </td> </tr>\n</table> However, there is no assurance that conditions will be favorable for such possible transactions or that our plans will be successful.\nPrincipal payments due on our debt (which exclude the effects of any discounts, premiums, or debt issue costs recorded) are as follows ($ amounts in thousands):\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>840,810 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>800,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,300,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,941,310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Results of Operations\nOur operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year due to a variety of reasons including acquisitions made during the year, incremental revenues and expenses from acquisitions made in the prior year, revenues and expenses from completed development properties, property disposals, annual escalation provisions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, new or amended debt agreements, issuances of shares through an equity offering, etc. Thus, our operating results for the current year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future years.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $289.8 million compared to net income of $225.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily due to additional revenue generated from the MEDIAN, Steward, and RCCH investments made in late 2016 and throughout 2017 and incremental revenue from completed development projects, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from such new investments, approximately $54 million in higher gains on sale of properties during 2016, and higher interest expense in 2017 primarily due to the $1.4 billion 5.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $474.9 million, or $1.35 per diluted share for 2017 as compared to $334.8 million, or $1.28 per diluted share for 2016. This 41.8% increase in FFO dollars is primarily due to the increase in revenue from acquisitions and completed development projects during 2017, while FFO per share is only a 5% increase in 2017 compared to prior year due to more shares outstanding from the September 2016 and May 2017 equity offerings.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent billed\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>435,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>327,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,513 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Straight-line rent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from direct financing leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and fee income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,506 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>704,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>541,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,608 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Our total revenue for 2017 is up $163.6 million or 30.2% over the prior year.

These increases are partially offset by $9.8 million of lower revenue related to dispositions and $4.8 million of higher straight-line rent write-offs in 2017 related to Adeptus Health and the sale of our Muskogee property. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Income from direct financing leases - up $10.2 million over the prior year of which $0.8 million is from annual escalations of rental rates in accordance with provisions in our leases, $4.8 million is incremental revenue from acquisitions made after December 31, 2016, and $9.8 million relates to the conversion of certain Prime facilities in October 2016 from mortgage loans to direct financing leases. These increases were partially offset by $5.2 million of net revenue earned in 2016 but not in 2017 from those RCCH facilities that converted from direct financing leases into operating leases in the first half of 2016. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest from loans - up $20.5 million over the prior year of which $1.5 million is from annual escalations in interest rates in accordance with loan provisions and $47.6 million is incremental revenue from new loans (primarily Steward mortgage loans made in October 2016 and September 2017). These increases were partially offset by $21.8 million in less interest revenue earned in 2017 from loans that were repaid in 2016 (primarily from the Capella Disposal Transaction as noted in Note 3 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and $7.0 million of lower interest revenue related to the conversion of certain Prime facilities, valued at approximately $100 million, from mortgage loans to direct financing leases in October 2016. </td> </tr>\n</table> Real estate depreciation and amortization during 2017 was $125.1 million compared to $94.4 million in 2016 primarily due to the incremental depreciation/amortization from the facilities acquired in 2017 and the development properties completed in 2016 and 2017.\nProperty expenses for 2017 increased $3 million compared to 2016 primarily due to the growth of our business internationally. In addition, property expenses for 2016 were lower than normal due to the reimbursement of $0.8 million from the tenant of our Twelve Oaks facility for property expenses incurred in 2015.\nAcquisition expenses decreased from $46.3 million in 2016 to $29.6 million in 2017 primarily as a result of $24.8 million of acquisition expenses incurred in 2016 associated with contingent consideration adjustments involving the seller's capital gains taxes on our MEDIAN transaction in 2015. As discussed in Note 2 to Item 8\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we expect acquisition expenses to significantly decrease in 2018 with adoption of the new accounting standard that should allow us to capitalize a significant majority of these acquisition costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2017 totaled $58.6 million, which is 8.3% of revenues, down from 9.0% of revenues in the prior year. The decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to our business model as we can generally increase our revenues significantly without increasing our head count and related expense at the same rate. On a dollar basis, general and administrative expenses were up $9.7 million from the prior year due primarily to increases in travel, international administration, costs associated with opening/maintaining a European office, compensation related to increased headcount and public company board expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold the Muskogee, Oklahoma facility resulting in a net gain on sale of real estate of $7.4 million, while in 2016, we had various dispositions resulting in a net gain on sale of real estate and other asset dispositions of $61.2 million and impairment charges of $7.2 million (see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\nEarnings from our equity interests increased from a loss of $1.1 million in 2016 to income of $10.1 million in 2017. The loss in 2016 includes approximately $5.4 million of one-time acquisition expenses, representing our share of such expenses incurred by our Italian joint venture to acquire its eight hospital properties. The remaining difference of $5.8 million is from additional income related to our increased ownership in and improved operating results of the operator of our Hoboken facility, along with additional income from our IMED Group investment in which the underlying facility began operations on March 31, 2017.\nInterest expense for 2017 and 2016 totaled $177.0 million and $159.6 million, respectively. Our average debt balance for 2017 was higher than 2016 due to the continued growth of the company; however, its impact on interest expense was partially offset by lower interest rates. Our weighted average interest rate was 4.6% for 2017, down from 4.9% in 2016. See Note 4 in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our debt activities.\nWith the redemption of the $450 million in senior unsecured notes, we incurred $22.5 million in debt refinancing charges ($15.5 million of which was a redemption premium) during 2016. During 2017, we incurred $32.6 million of debt refinancing charges related to the replacement of our credit facility, the payoff of our \u0080200 million term loan, the payoff of our \u0080200 million euro bonds, the prepayment of our $350 million senior unsecured notes, and structuring and underwriting fees associated with the termination of the short-term loan commitment we made in anticipation of the Steward transaction in 2017.\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based taxes and withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The provision for income taxes was an expense of $2.7 million for 2017 compared to a benefit of $6.8 million for 2016. As discussed in Note 5 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the income tax benefit recognized for 2016 was primarily due to acquisition costs associated with our European investments and the release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets of approximately $4 million. We continue to reflect a valuation allowance against our U.S. and certain foreign net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $225.0 million compared to net income of $139.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to additional revenue generated from our new investments and from completed development projects, $61.2 million of gains on real estate and other disposals, and a $15 million reduction in acquisition expenses, partially offset by higher debt refinancing costs and interest expense in 2016. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in\nthe section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $334.8 million, or $1.28 per diluted share for 2016 as compared to $274.8 million, or $1.26 per diluted share for 2015, a 2% increase on a per share basis. This increase in FFO per share was primarily due to additional revenue from new investments, partially offset by the loss of income from properties disposed of in 2016, higher interest costs and an increase in the number of shares outstanding during 2016 to fund such new investments.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent billed\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>327,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>247,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,665 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Straight-line rent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,692 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from direct financing leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,592 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and fee income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,690 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>541,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>441,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,259 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Our total revenue for 2016 was up $99.3 million or 22.5% over the prior year.

The increase was also attributable to $15.0 million earned on our Capella properties after lease reclassification from DFL to operating lease accounting as part of the April 29, 2016 amendments.

The decrease was partially offset by $18.0 million of additional interest from other loans made during 2016, including the Prime mortgage loans, $2.1 million of interest on the Capella mortgage and acquisition loans that were outstanding longer in 2016 than in 2015, and $0.4 million in annual escalation provisions of our loans. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal estate depreciation and amortization during 2016 was $94.4 million compared to $69.9 million in 2015 primarily due to the incremental depreciation/amortization from the facilities acquired in 2016 and the development properties completed in 2015 and 2016. In the 2016 second quarter, we accelerated the amortization of the lease intangible asset related to our Corinth facility resulting in $1.1 million of additional expense. This was offset by a similar $1.1 million of expense in 2015 to accelerate the amortization of lease intangible assets associated with Twelve Oaks, Luling, and Healthtrax properties.\nProperty expenses for 2016 decreased $1.1 million compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the reimbursement of $0.8 million from the tenant of our Twelve Oaks facility for property expenses incurred in previous periods.\nAcquisition expenses decreased from $61.3 million in 2015 to $46.3 million in 2016 primarily as a result of $31.7 million in lower real estate transfer taxes associated with our international acquisitions. This decrease was partially offset by $24.8 million of acquisition expenses incurred in 2016 associated with contingent consideration adjustments involving the seller's capital gains taxes on our MEDIAN transaction in 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2016 totaled $48.9 million, which was 9.0% of revenues, down from 9.9% of revenues in the prior year. The decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to our business model as we can generally increase our revenues significantly without increasing our headcount and related expense at the same rate. On a dollar basis, general and administrative expenses were up $5.3 million from the prior year due to higher international administrative expenses, and to a lesser extent personnel and travel costs, which were up as a result of the growth and expansion of our company.\nInterest expense for 2016 and 2015 totaled $159.6 million and $120.9 million, respectively. This increase was related to higher average debt balances in the current year associated with our 4.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 entered into in August 2015 and our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024 entered into in February 2016 and our expanded credit facility. In addition, we incurred $1.7 million in additional interest expense in 2016 between the time we issued the $500 million 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 in July 2016 and when we were able to redeem the $450 million 6.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021 in August 2016. Our weighted average interest rate was 4.9% for 2016, up from 4.3% in 2015 due to more permanent debt financing in 2016 and higher LIBOR rates. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our debt activities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we had various dispositions resulting in a net gain on sale of real estate and other asset dispositions of $61.2 million and impairment charges of $7.2 million (see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\nEarnings from our equity interests declined from $2.8 million of income in the 2015 to a loss of $1.1 million in 2016. The loss in 2016 includes approximately $5.4 million of one-time acquisition expenses, representing our share of such expenses incurred by our Italian joint venture to acquire its eight hospital properties. Excluding these acquisition expenses, our earnings from our equity interest would have been $4.3 million, an increase over 2015 due to $3.4 million of income from our Italian joint venture (no such income was recorded in 2015).\nWith the redemption of the $450 million in senior unsecured notes, we incurred $22.5 million in debt refinancing charges ($15.5 million of which was a redemption premium) during 2016. During 2015, we incurred $4.4 million of charges primarily related to structuring and underwriting fees associated with the bridge loan entered into as a back stop on financing the original Capella acquisition.\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based taxes and withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The provision for income taxes was a benefit of $6.8 million for 2016 compared to expense of $1.5 million for 2015. As discussed in Note 5 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the income tax benefit recognized for 2016 was primarily due to acquisition costs associated with our European investments (approximately $5.1 million) and the release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets of approximately $4 million.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe consider non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of financial performance, financial position or cash\nflows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Described below are the non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nFunds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations\nInvestors and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations, or FFO, as a supplemental performance measure. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) on sales of real estate and impairment charges on real estate assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nIn addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose normalized FFO, which adjusts FFO for items that relate to unanticipated or non-core events or activities or accounting changes that, if not noted, would make comparison to prior period results and market expectations potentially less meaningful to investors and analysts.\nWe believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and the use of normalized FFO makes comparisons of our operating results with prior periods and other companies more meaningful. While FFO and normalized FFO are relevant and widely used supplemental measures of operating and financial performance of REITs, they should not be viewed as a substitute measure of our operating performance since the measures do not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which can be significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations.

It is our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code and to avoid corporate income and excise taxes on undistributed income. However, our Credit Facility limits the amounts of dividends we can pay - see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Other intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values, which are based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant's lease and our overall relationship with that tenant. Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement, among other factors. At December 31, 2017, we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles.\nWe use direct financing lease (\u201cDFL\u201d) accounting to record rent on certain leases deemed to be financing leases, per accounting rules, rather than operating leases. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectability of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unearned income.\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>648,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>720,300 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 5.500% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>324,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>547,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>707,188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3.325% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>660,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>759,917 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>605,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>736,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 5.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,750,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,104,667 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility(1)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>843,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>924,606 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term loan\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>206,573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>224,718 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease commitments(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>191,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233,571 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178,028 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>361,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>512,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,043,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,079,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,996,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Completed the Capella Disposal Transaction (as fully described in Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in which we sold our equity investment, received $395 million to settle outstanding acquisition loans and received $210 million in prepayment of two mortgage loans for hospitals in Russellville, Arkansas and Lawton, Oklahoma, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $600 million; \nIn 2016, we invested or committed to invest approximately $1.8 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and quality of our healthcare portfolio, while improving our tenant concentration and expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. Furthermore, we strategically sold assets for proceeds totaling more than $800 million, refinanced $1 billion of debt, and sold 82.7 million shares generating proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion in order to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce leverage, and fund acquisitions.\n e) On May 1, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately 43.1 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $548 million.

million compared to net income of $225.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily due to additional revenue generated from the MEDIAN, Steward, and RCCH investments made in late 2016 and throughout 2017 and incremental revenue from completed development projects, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from such new investments, approximately $54 million in higher gains on sale of properties during 2016, and higher interest expense in 2017 primarily due to the $1.4 billion 5.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $474.9 million, or $1.35 per diluted share for 2017 as compared to $334.8 million, or $1.28 per diluted share for 2016. This 41.8% increase in FFO dollars is primarily due to the increase in revenue from acquisitions and completed development projects during 2017, while FFO per share is only a 5% increase in 2017 compared to prior year due to more shares outstanding from the September 2016 and May 2017 equity offerings.\nLosses from Operating Lease Receivables: We utilize the information above along with the tenants' payment and default history in evaluating (on a property-by-property basis) whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding rent receivables is needed. A provision for losses on rent receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full. The provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral, if any.\nIn addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose normalized FFO, which adjusts FFO for items that relate to unanticipated or non-core events or activities or accounting changes that, if not noted, would make comparison to prior period results and market expectations potentially less meaningful to investors and analysts.\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\nInterest expense for 2016 and 2015 totaled $159.6 million and $120.9 million, respectively. This increase was related to higher average debt balances in the current year associated with our 4.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 entered into in August 2015 and our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024 entered into in February 2016 and our expanded credit facility. In addition, we incurred $1.7 million in additional interest expense in 2016 between the time we issued the $500 million 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 in July 2016 and when we were able to redeem the $450 million 6.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021 in August 2016. Our weighted average interest rate was 4.9% for 2016, up from 4.3% in 2015 due to more permanent debt financing in 2016 and higher LIBOR rates. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our debt activities.\n2017 Highlights\n \u2022 Operating lease revenue (including rent billed and straight-line rent) - up $97.4 million over the prior year of which $0.2 million was from our annual escalation provisions in our leases, $69.6 million was from incremental revenue from acquisitions made in 2016 (including $15.0 million related to Steward), $20.2 million was incremental revenue from development properties that were completed and put into service in 2016 and 2015, and $2.1 million was from capital additions at our existing facilities during 2016. The increase was also attributable to $15.0 million earned on our Capella properties after lease reclassification from DFL to operating lease accounting as part of the April 29, 2016 amendments. These increases were partially offset by $10.3 million of lower revenues from the 2016 dispositions. \n \u2022 Acquired 15 acute care hospitals, one rehabilitation hospital, and one behavioral health facility, completed mortgage financing on two acute care hospitals, and invested in an additional minority equity contribution in Steward for an aggregate investment of $1.8 billion; \n \u2022 Income from direct financing leases - up $10.2 million over the prior year of which $0.8 million is from annual escalations of rental rates in accordance with provisions in our leases, $4.8 million is incremental revenue from acquisitions made after December 31, 2016, and $9.8 million relates to the conversion of certain Prime facilities in October 2016 from mortgage loans to direct financing leases. These increases were partially offset by $5.2 million of net revenue earned in 2016 but not in 2017 from those RCCH facilities that converted from direct financing leases into operating leases in the first half of 2016. \n (1) The 2017 column reflects a commitment to acquire an RCCH facility post December 31, 2017. The 2016 column includes post December 31, 2016 transactions and commitments such as two RCCH facilities and 14 facilities in Germany. \n \u2022 Acquired (or committed to acquire) real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $1.8 billion as noted below: \n (2) As of December 31, 2017, we have a $1.3 billion revolving credit facility. However, this table assumes the balance outstanding under the revolver and rate in effect at December 31, 2017 (which was $840.8 million as of December 31, 2017) remains in effect through maturity. \nA summary of our 2016 highlights is as follows:\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nWith the redemption of the $450 million in senior unsecured notes, we incurred $22.5 million in debt refinancing charges ($15.5 million of which was a redemption premium) during 2016. During 2015, we incurred $4.4 million of charges primarily related to structuring and underwriting fees associated with the bridge loan entered into as a back stop on financing the original Capella acquisition.\n \u2022 Completed the sale-leaseback transaction (step 2 of the initial transaction in 2014) of 31 MEDIAN facilities in Germany for an aggregate purchase price of \u0080646 million; \nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values, if any, for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. We amortize any resulting capitalized above-market lease values as a reduction of rental income over lease term. We amortize any resulting capitalized below-market lease values as an increase to rental income over the lease term. Because our strategy to a large degree involves the origination and acquisition of long-term lease arrangements at market rates with independent parties, we do not expect the above-market and below-market in-place lease values to be significant for many of our transactions.\n \u2022 Sold the real estate of an acute care facility in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for a net gain of $7.4 million. \nThese investments include the following at December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nWe intend to pay to our stockholders, within the time periods prescribed by the Code, all or substantially all of our annual REIT taxable income, including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities. It is our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code and to avoid corporate income and excise taxes on undistributed income. However, our Credit Facility limits the amounts of dividends we can pay - see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n \u2022 Acquired real estate assets (or committed to acquire real estate assets), entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $1.8 billion as noted below: \nThe following table summarizes known material contractual obligations (including interest) as of December 31, 2017, excluding the impact of subsequent events (amounts in thousands):\n \u2022 Acquired 12 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in Germany for a combined purchase price of \u008085.2 million and committed \u0080174.6 million to acquire 14 additional inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. These facilities are leased to MEDIAN or its affiliates; \n (3) The 2016 column includes a $9.1 million tax benefit generated from the reversal of foreign valuation allowances and acquisition expenses incurred by certain international subsidiaries. \nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nInvestors and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations, or FFO, as a supplemental performance measure. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) on sales of real estate and impairment charges on real estate assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nReal estate depreciation and amortization during 2016 was $94.4 million compared to $69.9 million in 2015 primarily due to the incremental depreciation/amortization from the facilities acquired in 2016 and the development properties completed in 2015 and 2016. In the 2016 second quarter, we accelerated the amortization of the lease intangible asset related to our Corinth facility resulting in $1.1 million of additional expense. This was offset by a similar $1.1 million of expense in 2015 to accelerate the amortization of lease intangible assets associated with Twelve Oaks, Luling, and Healthtrax properties.\n d) On March 31, 2017, we sold the EASTAR Health System real estate located in Muskogee, Oklahoma, which was leased to RCCH. Total proceeds from this transaction were approximately $64 million resulting in a gain of $7.4 million. \nWe continually evaluate all of our transactions and investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a variable interest entity. If we determine that we have a variable interest in a variable interest entity, we then evaluate if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether we have the ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. We consolidate each variable interest entity in which we, by virtue of or transactions with our investments in the entity, are considered to be the primary beneficiary. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entity in which we hold a variable interest (such as Ernest) because we do not control the activities (such as the day-to-day operations of the hospital) that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities.\n b) On August 11, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 28.75 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $337 million, after deducting estimated offering expenses. \n2016 Highlights\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2016 totaled $48.9 million, which was 9.0% of revenues, down from 9.9% of revenues in the prior year. The decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to our business model as we can generally increase our revenues significantly without increasing our headcount and related expense at the same rate. On a dollar basis, general and administrative expenses were up $5.3 million from the prior year due to higher international administrative expenses, and to a lesser extent personnel and travel costs, which were up as a result of the growth and expansion of our company.\nStock-Based Compensation: During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recorded $9.9 million, $7.9 million, and $11.1 million, respectively, of expense for share-based compensation related to grants of restricted common stock and other stock-based awards. Starting in 2010, we granted annual performance-based restricted share awards that vest based on the achievement of certain market conditions as defined by the accounting rules. Typical market conditions for our awards are based on our total shareholder return (factoring in stock price appreciation and dividends paid) including comparisons of our total shareholder returns to an index of other REIT stocks. Because these awards are earned based on the achievement of these market conditions, we must initially evaluate and estimate the probability of achieving these market conditions in order to determine the fair value of the award and over what period we should recognize stock compensation expense. Because of the complexities inherently involved with these awards, we work with an independent consultant to assist us in modeling both the value of the award and the various periods over which each tranche of an award will be earned. We use what is termed a Monte Carlo simulation model, which determines a value and earnings periods based on multiple outcomes and their probabilities. We record expense over the expected or derived vesting periods using the calculated value of the awards. We record expense over these vesting periods even though the awards have not yet been earned and, in fact, may never be earned - such as was the case with our 2015 performance awards in which 348,938 shares were forfeited because the related market conditions were not achieved for the period of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. If awards vest faster than our original estimate, we will record a catch-up of expense.\nEarnings from our equity interests declined from $2.8 million of income in the 2015 to a loss of $1.1 million in 2016. The loss in 2016 includes approximately $5.4 million of one-time acquisition expenses, representing our share of such expenses incurred by our Italian joint venture to acquire its eight hospital properties. Excluding these acquisition expenses, our earnings from our equity interest would have been $4.3 million, an increase over 2015 due to $3.4 million of income from our Italian joint venture (no such income was recorded in 2015).\nLosses on DFL Receivables: Allowances are established for DFLs based upon an estimate of probable losses on a property-by-property basis. DFLs are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the lease. Like operating lease receivables, the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's overall financial condition; economic resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the DFL's effective interest rate, fair value of collateral, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. DFLs are placed on non-accrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. If on non-accrual status, we generally account for the DFLs on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash.\n \u2022 issuing of new USD or EUR denominated debt securities, including senior unsecured notes; and/or \n e) On June 17, 2016, we sold our investment in one property leased and operated by Corinth Investor Holdings for $28 million. \nPrincipal payments due on our debt (which exclude the effects of any discounts, premiums, or debt issue costs recorded) are as follows ($ amounts in thousands):\n On February 15, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock to be paid on April 12, 2018, to stockholders of record on March 15, 2018.\nIn regards to other financing activities in which we used such net proceeds to ultimately fund our approximate $1.5 billion of acquisitions in 2016 and the remainder of our development activities, we did the following:\n c) On January 14, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 34.5 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $480 million, after deducting estimated offering expenses.  Debt Restrictions and REIT Requirements\ncorresponding offset to deferred revenue during the construction period. When the lessee takes physical possession of the facility, we begin recognizing the deferred construction period revenue on the straight-line method over the remaining term of the lease.\n \u2022 Sold the remaining 14.9 million shares under our January 2014 at-the-market equity offering program resulting in net proceeds of approximately $224 million; \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to MPT common stockholders to FFO and normalized FFO for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013 ($ amounts in thousands except per share data):\nLoans: Loans consist of mortgage loans, working capital loans and other long-term loans. Mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property. Working capital and other long-term loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees. We record loans at cost. We evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal on a loan-by-loan basis (using the same process as we do\nWe generated cash of $363 million from operating activities during 2017, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $326.7 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\n\nIn 2015, we held an equity investment in Capella (now RCCH) similar to our Ernest equity investment. We accounted for this investment under the fair value option election as well. We recorded no unrealized gain/loss on this investment in 2015 and through April 2016. In April 2016, we sold our Capella equity investment at cost resulting in no recognized gain/loss.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we had various dispositions resulting in a net gain on sale of real estate and other asset dispositions of $61.2 million and impairment charges of $7.2 million (see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\n b) On March 1, 2016, we updated our at-the-market equity program, which gave us the ability to sell up to $227 million of stock with a commission rate of 1.25%. During 2016, we sold approximately 15 million shares of our common stock under this program, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $224 million, after deducting expenses of approximately $2.8 million of commissions. \nHowever, in order to fund our investment strategies and to fund debt maturities coming due in later years, we believe the following sources of capital are generally available in the market and we may access one or a combination of them:\n c) On April 30, 2016, we closed on the Capella Disposal Transaction (as further discussed in Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) resulting in net proceeds of $550 million along with an additional $50 million once we sold our investment in RegionalCare Hospital Partners, Inc. bonds in June 2016. \n \u2022 Sold investments in real estate and equity interests and received payments in full on loans for proceeds of more than $800 million as noted below: \nIncome tax expense includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based taxes and withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The provision for income taxes was an expense of $2.7 million for 2017 compared to a benefit of $6.8 million for 2016. As discussed in Note 5 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the income tax benefit recognized for 2016 was primarily due to acquisition costs associated with our European investments and the release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets of approximately $4 million. We continue to reflect a valuation allowance against our U.S. and certain foreign net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017.\nWe also receive additional rent (contingent rent) under some leases based on increases in CPI or where CPI exceeds the annual minimum percentage increase as stipulated in the lease. Contingent rents are recorded as rent billed revenue in the period earned.\nEarnings from our equity interests increased from a loss of $1.1 million in 2016 to income of $10.1 million in 2017. The loss in 2016 includes approximately $5.4 million of one-time acquisition expenses, representing our share of such expenses incurred by our Italian joint venture to acquire its eight hospital properties. The remaining difference of $5.8 million is from additional income related to our increased ownership in and improved operating results of the operator of our Hoboken facility, along with additional income from our IMED Group investment in which the underlying facility began operations on March 31, 2017.\n \u2022 Executed a $19 million agreement to develop an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Toledo, Ohio, acquired an inpatient rehabilitation facility and a long-term acute care hospital in Lubbock, Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $31.5 million, and acquired an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Weslaco, Texas for $10.7 million all leased to Ernest; \n Total Gross Assets\nIn addition to these restrictions, the Credit Facility contains customary financial and operating covenants, including covenants relating to our total leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, secured leverage ratio, unsecured leverage ratio, consolidated adjusted net worth, and unsecured interest coverage ratio. This facility also contains customary events of default, including among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, material inaccuracy of representations and failure to comply with our covenants. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the facility, the entire outstanding balance may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all such financial and operating covenants.\n d) On May 23, 2016, we sold our investment in five properties leased and operated by Post Acute Medical for $71 million. \nProperty expenses for 2016 decreased $1.1 million compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the reimbursement of $0.8 million from the tenant of our Twelve Oaks facility for property expenses incurred in previous periods.\nfor assessing the collectability of rents as discussed above) to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the allowance is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to either the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the loans effective interest rate or to the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent.\n2015 Highlights\nAcquisition expenses decreased from $61.3 million in 2015 to $46.3 million in 2016 primarily as a result of $31.7 million in lower real estate transfer taxes associated with our international acquisitions. This decrease was partially offset by $24.8 million of acquisition expenses incurred in 2016 associated with contingent consideration adjustments involving the seller's capital gains taxes on our MEDIAN transaction in 2015.\n \u2022 Sold the real estate of three inpatient rehabilitation hospitals located in Texas, for proceeds of $111.5 million, resulting in a net gain of approximately $45 million. \n \u2022 amending or entering into new bank term loans; \nA summary of our 2015 highlights is as follows:\n (3) Most of our contractual obligations to make operating lease payments are related to ground leases for which we are reimbursed by our tenants along with corporate office and equipment leases. \nAs of February 28, 2018, we have no debt principal payments due between now and January 2021 when our revolving credit facility comes due (which can be extended by one year). With our liquidity as of February 28, 2018 of approximately $0.6 billion, along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest and availability under our at-the-market equity program, we believe we have the liquidity available for us to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements, and our purchase obligations included in the \u201cContractual Obligations\u201d schedule for the foreseeable future.\nvalued as if vacant when acquired. Management's estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which we expect to be about six months (based on experience) depending on specific local market conditions. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal costs, and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction.\n</table>\n \u2022 Completed $30 million mortgage financing to Prime for a general acute care hospital in Port Huron, Michigan and subsequently converted a portion of the loan to real estate for $20 million, which reduced the mortgage loan accordingly; \n \u2022 Increased our credit facility (that was in place in 2015) to $1.95 billion comprised of a $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and a $250 million senior unsecured term loan facility along with a $400 million accordion feature, issued \u0080500 million of unsecured notes, and raised $817 million in equity to fund the acquisition activity mentioned above. \nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year that began on April 6, 2004 and ended on December 31, 2004. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gain, to our stockholders. It is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain such status going forward.\nOur mortgage and acquisition loans with Ernest are recorded at fair value based on Level 2 inputs by discounting the estimated cash flows using the market rates which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and the same remaining maturities. Our equity investment in Ernest is recorded at fair value based on Level 3 inputs, by using a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates of our investee such as projected revenue and expenses and appropriate consideration of the underlying risk profile of the forecasted assumptions associated with the investee. We classify the equity investment as Level 3, as we use certain unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement, and the valuation requires management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. For the cash flow\n ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nIn regards to other financing activities in which we used such net proceeds to ultimately fund our approximate $1.8 billion of acquisitions in 2015 and the remainder of our development activities, we did the following:\nAcquired Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation: For properties acquired for leasing purposes, we currently account for such acquisitions based on business combination accounting rules. We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we may utilize a number of sources, including available real estate broker data, independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, internal data from previous acquisitions or developments, and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\n g) On July 20, 2016, we sold three facilities leased to HealthSouth Corporation for $111.5 million. \nWe were incorporated in Maryland on August 27, 2003, primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net-leased healthcare facilities. We also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants. We conduct our business operations in one segment. We have healthcare investments in the U.S. and Europe. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 U.S. federal income tax return. Our existing tenants are, and our prospective tenants will generally be, healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations. We offer financing for these operators' real estate through 100% lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long-term basis ranging from 10 to 15 years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers. We also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases. Our existing portfolio's minimum escalators range from 0.5% to 4%, while less than 3% of our properties do not have an escalator. Most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases. In addition to rent or mortgage interest, our leases and loans typically require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility. Some leases also may require our tenants to pay percentage rents, which are based on the tenant's revenues from their operations. Finally, we may acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in the tenant's income or loss.\n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Lewiston, Idaho for $87.5 million. This facility is leased to RCCH; \nAs of February 28, 2018, we have no debt principal payments due in 2018 - see debt maturity schedule below. At February 28, 2018, our availability under our revolving credit facility plus cash on-hand approximated $0.6 billion. We believe this liquidity along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest and availability under our at-the-market equity program is sufficient to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, our purchase obligations as disclosed in the \u201cContractual Obligations\u201d schedule earlier, and dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements for the next twelve months.\nWe consider non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of financial performance, financial position or cash\n \u2022 Acquired 17 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and one acute care hospital in Germany for a combined purchase price of \u0080274 million. These facilities are leased to MEDIAN or its affiliates; \nWe generated cash of $207.0 million from operating activities during 2015, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $183.0 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\nWhen circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments, we review the recoverability of the facility's carrying value. The review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, from the facility's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends, and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis, such as was the case with our Monroe and Bucks facilities in 2014, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility. We do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at December 31, 2017; however, given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken.\n \u2022 placing new secured loans on real estate located in the U.S. and/or Europe.  However, there is no assurance that conditions will be favorable for such possible transactions or that our plans will be successful.\nIn arriving at the DLOM, we started with a DLOM range based on the results of studies supporting valuation discounts for other transactions or structures without a public market. To select the appropriate DLOM within the range, we then considered many qualitative factors including the percent of control, the nature of the underlying investee's business along with our rights as an investor pursuant to the operating agreement, the size of investment, expected holding period, number of shareholders, access to capital marketplace, etc. To illustrate the effect of movements in the DLOM, we performed a sensitivity analysis below by using basis point variations (dollars in thousands):\nOur operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year due to a variety of reasons including acquisitions made during the year, incremental revenues and expenses from acquisitions made in the prior year, revenues and expenses from completed development properties, property disposals, annual escalation provisions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, new or amended debt agreements, issuances of shares through an equity offering, etc. Thus, our operating results for the current year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future years.\n \u2022 Interest and fee income - down $3.7 million over the prior year, which was attributable to $22.9 million in interest earned in 2015 from loans that were converted to real estate on or before December 31, 2016, in connection with the MEDIAN Transaction and $1.1 million related to loan pay downs in 2016. The decrease was partially offset by $18.0 million of additional interest from other loans made during 2016, including the Prime mortgage loans, $2.1 million of interest on the Capella mortgage and acquisition loans that were outstanding longer in 2016 than in 2015, and $0.4 million in annual escalation provisions of our loans. \n (2) Includes $137.4 million and $109.1 million of unfunded amounts on ongoing development projects and $16.8 million and $84.9 million of unfunded amounts on capital improvement projects and development projects that have commenced rent, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Distribution Policy\n \u2022 Completed a $500 million senior unsecured notes offering in July 2016 and used the proceeds to redeem our $450 million 6.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021; \n \u2022 Completed construction and began recording rental income on 17 acute care facilities in Texas, Arizona, and Colorado with Adeptus Health totaling approximately $102.6 million and an acute care facility and a medical office building in Birmingham, Alabama with UAB Medical West totaling $8.6 million. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold the Muskogee, Oklahoma facility resulting in a net gain on sale of real estate of $7.4 million, while in 2016, we had various dispositions resulting in a net gain on sale of real estate and other asset dispositions of $61.2 million and impairment charges of $7.2 million (see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\n \u2022 Sold the real estate of a long-term acute care facility in Corinth, Texas, for proceeds of $28 million; and \n Our total revenue for 2017 is up $163.6 million or 30.2% over the prior year. This increase is made up of the following:\n \u2022 To fund our over $2.2 billion of asset investments, while lowering our average interest cost, we successfully refinanced approximately $0.6 billion of debt, and generated proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion from the sale of 43.1 million shares in an equity offering and through new issuances of unsecured notes. Details of such activities are as follows: \n \u2022 Sold the real estate of five properties (three of which were in Texas and two in Louisiana), received payment in full for outstanding loans, and recovered our investment in operations for proceeds of $71 million, resulting in a net gain of approximately $15 million; \n f) On September 7, 2017, we completed a senior unsecured notes offering for $1.4 billion. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the 5.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 offering to redeem the $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022, plus a redemption premium, on October 7, 2017. The remaining proceeds, plus borrowings on our revolving credit facility, were used to acquire nine facilities and ancillary properties leased to Steward for $700 million, to make mortgage on two properties for $700 million and to make a $100 million equity investment in Steward. \n c) On March 24, 2017, we completed a senior unsecured notes offering for \u0080500 million. We used the net proceeds from this offering to prepay and extinguish the new \u0080200 million term loan with the remainder of the proceeds used to acquire 12 facilities leased to MEDIAN for \u0080146.4 million. \nWith the redemption of the $450 million in senior unsecured notes, we incurred $22.5 million in debt refinancing charges ($15.5 million of which was a redemption premium) during 2016. During 2017, we incurred $32.6 million of debt refinancing charges related to the replacement of our credit facility, the payoff of our \u0080200 million term loan, the payoff of our \u0080200 million euro bonds, the prepayment of our $350 million senior unsecured notes, and structuring and underwriting fees associated with the termination of the short-term loan commitment we made in anticipation of the Steward transaction in 2017.\nUnless otherwise indicated, references to \u201cour,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MPT Operating Partnership, L.P.\nDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\n \u2022 Closed on the final MEDIAN property, as part of the initial MEDIAN transaction, for a purchase price of \u008041.6 million. See \u201c2015 Activity\u201d for a description of the initial MEDIAN Transaction; \n \u2022 Executed an additional $250 million agreement with Adeptus Health for the development of acute care hospitals and free-standing emergency departments; and \nIn 2017, we invested or committed to invest approximately $2.2 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and scale of our healthcare portfolio, while expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. and extending our lease and mortgage loan maturity schedule. Furthermore, we strategically sold an asset for proceeds totaling $64 million, raised $548 million in proceeds from a successful equity offering, and refinanced approximately $0.6 billion of debt in order to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce interest rates, and fund acquisitions. Finally, we increased our dividend to $0.24 per share per quarter in 2017 - the third year in a row for such an increase.\n (4) Includes approximately $140 million of future expenditures related to development projects, a $17.5 million commitment to acquire one RCCH facility post December 31, 2017 and future expenditures on commenced capital improvement projects. We have excluded from the table above $312.2 million of capital expenditure commitments in our leases that we are not definitive on the amount, timing, and certainty of funding. However, payment on any of these commitments, if made, would be added to the lease base upon which the lessee will pay us rents.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n We measure the estimated fair value of most of these investments utilizing Level 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Under current accounting guidance, Level 3 represents fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\n \u2022 sale of equity securities; \nWe amortize the value of lease intangibles to expense over the term of the respective leases, which have a weighted average useful life of 26.5 years at December 31, 2017. If a lease is terminated, the unamortized portion of the lease intangible is charged to expense as was the case with our Twelve Oaks property in 2015.\n Our total revenue for 2016 was up $99.3 million or 22.5% over the prior year. This increase was made up of the following:\n \u2022 Completed the sale leaseback transaction converting the remaining $93.3 million RCCH acquisition loan on the Olympia, Washington property to real estate, including funding an additional $7 million; and \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n \u2022 Initiated long term relationship with AXA Real Estate Investment Managers to co-invest with AXA-advised accounts for the acquisition of acute care hospitals in Spain and Italy via a joint venture arrangement; \nFair Value Option Election: We elected to account for certain investments acquired on February 29, 2012, as part of the Ernest transaction, using the fair value option method, which means we mark these investments to fair market value on a recurring basis. Any changes in the fair value of these investments are non-cash adjustments that will not impact our financial condition or cash flows unless we decided to liquidate these investments.\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we expect acquisition expenses to significantly decrease in 2018 with adoption of the new accounting standard that should allow us to capitalize a significant majority of these acquisition costs.\n \u2022 Sold 10.3 million shares of common stock in a private placement, generating total proceeds of $150 million. \nRevenue Recognition: We receive income from operating leases based on the fixed, minimum required rents (base rents) per the lease agreements. Rent revenue from base rents is recorded on the straight-line method over the terms of the related lease agreements for new leases and the remaining terms of existing leases for those acquired as part of a property acquisition. The straight-line method records the periodic average amount of base rent earned over the term of a lease, taking into account contractual rent adjustments over the lease term. The straight-line method typically has the effect of recording more rent revenue from a lease than a tenant is required to pay early in the term of the lease. During the later parts of a lease term, this effect reverses with less rent revenue recorded than a tenant is required to pay. Rent revenue, as recorded on the straight-line method, in the consolidated statements of income is presented as two amounts: rent billed revenue and straight-line revenue. Rent billed revenue is the amount of base rent actually billed to the customer each period as required by the lease. Straight-line rent revenue is the difference between rent revenue earned based on the straight-line method and the amount recorded as rent billed revenue. We record the difference between base rent revenues earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements, as applicable, as an increase or decrease to straight-line rent receivable.\nWe expect to lower our outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility, improve our leverage metrics, and reduce our tenant concentration in Steward during 2018. We expect to accomplish this by entering into joint venture arrangements, and/or completing strategic property sales, among other alternatives. However, no assurance can be made that such transactions will be available to us or that our plans will be successful.\nIn order to prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) in the U.S., we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances. We believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of our revenues, credit losses, fair values (either as part of a purchase price allocation, impairment analysis or in valuing certain of our equity investments), periodic depreciation of our real estate assets, and stock compensation expense, along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results, have significant effects on our financial statements. Each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments. We rely on our experience, collect historical and current market data, and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. See Note 2 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policies and recent accounting developments. Our accounting estimates include the following:\nA summary of our 2017 highlights is as follows:\n\n Because the fair value of Ernest investments noted above is below our original cost, we recognized an unrealized loss in 2017. No unrealized gain/loss on the Ernest investments were recorded in previous years.\nWe believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and the use of normalized FFO makes comparisons of our operating results with prior periods and other companies more meaningful. While FFO and normalized FFO are relevant and widely used supplemental measures of operating and financial performance of REITs, they should not be viewed as a substitute measure of our operating performance since the measures do not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which can be significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations. FFO and normalized FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2017, our portfolio consisted of 275 properties leased or loaned to 31 operators, of which three are under development and 14 are in the form of mortgage loans.\nCommitment fees received from lessee for development and leasing services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the initial term of a lease to produce a constant effective yield on the lease (interest method). Commitment and origination fees from lending services are also recorded as deferred revenue initially and recognized as income over the life of the loan using the interest method.\nTotal gross assets is total assets before accumulated depreciation/amortization and assumes all real estate binding commitments on new investments and unfunded amounts on development deals and commenced capital improvement projects are fully funded, and assumes cash on hand is fully used in these transactions. We believe total gross assets is useful to investors as it provides a more current view of our portfolio and allows for a better understanding of our concentration levels as our binding commitments close and our other commitments are fully funded. The following table presents a reconciliation of total assets to total gross assets (in thousands):\n h) On November 13, 2017, we entered into a new at-the-market equity program, which gives us the ability to sell up to $750 million of stock with a commission rate of up to 2.0%. We did not sell any shares under this program in 2017.  2016 Cash Flow Activity\nOverview\nProperty expenses for 2017 increased $3 million compared to 2016 primarily due to the growth of our business internationally. In addition, property expenses for 2016 were lower than normal due to the reimbursement of $0.8 million from the tenant of our Twelve Oaks facility for property expenses incurred in 2015.\n \u2022 Provided $100 million mortgage financing to Prime for three general acute care hospitals and one free-standing emergency department in New Jersey and acquired two general acute care hospitals in the Kansas City area for $110 million; \n h) On September 30, 2016, we completed a public offering of 57.5 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $799.5 million, after deducting offering expenses. \n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 43.1 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $548 million, after deducting estimated offering expenses. \n \u2022 Acquired a portfolio of five acute care hospitals and completed mortgage financing on four acute care hospitals in Massachusetts and invested in a minority equity contribution in Steward for an aggregate investment of $1.25 billion; \nLosses from Rent Receivables: For all leases, we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including, but not limited to: admission levels and surgery/procedure volumes by type; current operating margins; ratio of our tenants' operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs; trends in revenue, cash collections, and patient mix; and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations on tenants' profitability and liquidity.\n2017 Cash Flow Activity\nThe table below is a summary of our distributions declared for the three year period ended December 31, 2017:\nFunds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations\n \u2022 Completed a $1.4 billion senior unsecured notes offering in September 2017 with a rate of 5.000% and used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022; \n f) On July 13, 2016, we completed a new $500 million senior unsecured notes offering. We used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem our $450 million 6.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021, which was completed on August 12, 2016. Net proceeds from the notes offering and redemption approximated $19 million, and we incurred a one-time charge of $22.5 million related to the redemption (see Note 4 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). \n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Newark, New Jersey, from Prime for an aggregate purchase price of $63.0 million and committed to advance an additional $30 million to Prime over a three-year period to be used solely for capital additions to the real estate; any such addition will be added to the basis upon which the lessee will pay us rents; \n \u2022 Income from direct financing leases - up $5.6 million over the prior year of which $0.8 million was from annual escalation provisions in our leases and $6.7 million was from incremental revenue from acquisitions made in 2016. This increase was also attributable to $0.3 million of incremental revenue on the Capella properties prior to lease reclassification. The increase was partially offset by the $2.6 million write-off of DFL non-cash income in connection with the Capella lease reclassification (see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details). \nIn regards to the underlying projection of revenues and expenses used in the discounted cash flow model, such projections are provided by Ernest. However, we will modify such projections (including underlying assumptions used) as needed based on our review and analysis of their historical results, meetings with key members of management, and our understanding of trends and developments within the healthcare industry.\n \u2022 Committed to purchase two acute care hospitals in Washington and Idaho for an aggregate purchase price of $105 million, which will be leased to RCCH. \nWe selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our TRSs, which the operators use for acquisitions and working capital. We consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons: (1) it provides opportunities to make income-earning investments that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise, and (2) by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators, we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of, and financing sources for, healthcare facilities.\nWe measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with new or in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property\n \u2022 proceeds from strategic property sales; \nmodel, our observable inputs include use of a capitalization rate, discount rate (which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital), and market interest rates, and our unobservable input includes an adjustment for a marketability discount (\u201cDLOM\u201d) on our equity investment of 40% at December 31, 2017.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nWe receive interest income from our tenants/borrowers on mortgage loans, working capital loans, and other long-term loans. Interest income from these loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal outstanding and terms of the loans.\n \u2022 Acquired real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $2.2 billion as noted below: \nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2017 totaled $58.6 million, which is 8.3% of revenues, down from 9.0% of revenues in the prior year. The decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to our business model as we can generally increase our revenues significantly without increasing our head count and related expense at the same rate. On a dollar basis, general and administrative expenses were up $9.7 million from the prior year due primarily to increases in travel, international administration, costs associated with opening/maintaining a European office, compensation related to increased headcount and public company board expenses.\nInvestments in Real Estate: We maintain our investments in real estate at cost, and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. While our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility, to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance, we expense those costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the weighted average useful life of approximately 39.1 years for buildings and improvements.\n \u2022 Prepaid the principal amount of the mortgage loan on our property in Kansas City, Missouri at par in the amount of $12.9 million; and \nIn 2015, we invested or committed to invest approximately $1.8 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments greatly strengthened our portfolio through geographic, tenant and property type diversification. We expanded total assets by 51%, increased revenues by 41%, and lowered our general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue to less than 10%.\nWe own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding receivables. We have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources, except those described above under \u201cDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\u201d.\nWe generated cash of $264.7 million from operating activities during 2016, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $218.4 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $225.0 million compared to net income of $139.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to additional revenue generated from our new investments and from completed development projects, $61.2 million of gains on real estate and other disposals, and a $15 million reduction in acquisition expenses, partially offset by higher debt refinancing costs and interest expense in 2016. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in\nOur debt facilities impose certain restrictions on us, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to: incur debt; create or incur liens; provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other entity; make\nthe section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $334.8 million, or $1.28 per diluted share for 2016 as compared to $274.8 million, or $1.26 per diluted share for 2015, a 2% increase on a per share basis. This increase in FFO per share was primarily due to additional revenue from new investments, partially offset by the loss of income from properties disposed of in 2016, higher interest costs and an increase in the number of shares outstanding during 2016 to fund such new investments.\n \u2022 Acquired the original Capella hospital portfolio (now RCCH) including seven acute care hospitals throughout the U.S. and obtained a stake in their operations for a combined total of approximately $900 million. Also, acquired an eighth facility (Kershaw) for $35 million later in the year. \n \u2022 Sold the real estate of a long-term acute care facility in Luling, Texas, and real estate of six wellness centers in the U.S. for a net gain; and \n g) On September 29, 2017, we prepaid the principal amount of the mortgage loan on our property in Kansas City, Missouri at par in the amount of $12.9 million. To fund such prepayment, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon, we used borrowings from the revolving credit facility. \nLong-term Liquidity Requirements:\n \u2022 entering into joint venture arrangements; \n \u2022 Acquired a 266-bed outpatient rehabilitation clinic located in Hannover, Germany from MEDIAN for \u008018.7 million; \n \u2022 Redeemed our 5.750% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020 using proceeds from our \u0080200 million term loan and cash on hand; \nShort-term Liquidity Requirements:\nWith these transactions, our weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2017, improved to 4.42% versus 4.87% at December 31, 2016.\n Results of Operations\nPrinciples of Consolidation: Property holding entities and other subsidiaries of which we own 100% of the equity or have a controlling financial interest evidenced by ownership of a majority voting interest are consolidated. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. For entities in which we own less than 100% of the equity interest, we consolidate the property if we have the direct or indirect ability to control the entities' activities based upon the terms of the respective entities' ownership agreements. For these entities, we record a non-controlling interest representing equity held by non-controlling interests.\n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 57.5 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $799.5 million, after deducting estimated offering expenses; and \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nflows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Described below are the non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n \u2022 Completed a $500 million senior unsecured notes offering in February 2016 and used the proceeds to reduce our outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility; \n \u2022 Completed the sale leaseback transaction with Prime converting our existing mortgage loan on three general acute care hospitals and one free-standing emergency department in New Jersey to real estate, for an aggregate investment of $115 million; \n \u2022 Executed agreements totaling more than $150 million with Circle Health Group and Surgery Partners, Inc. to develop acute care hospitals in Birmingham, England and Idaho Falls, Idaho, respectively.  With these new investments, we expanded our gross assets to $9.5 billion, increased the total number of properties in our portfolio to 275, and increased our total number of beds to more than 32 thousand, as of December 31, 2017.\n (1) Our 4.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 and 3.325% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025 are euro-denominated. A portion of our revolver is British pound-denominated. We used the exchange rate at December 31, 2017 (1.2005 for euros and 1.3513 for British pounds) in preparing this table. \n \u2022 Interest from loans - up $20.5 million over the prior year of which $1.5 million is from annual escalations in interest rates in accordance with loan provisions and $47.6 million is incremental revenue from new loans (primarily Steward mortgage loans made in October 2016 and September 2017). These increases were partially offset by $21.8 million in less interest revenue earned in 2017 from loans that were repaid in 2016 (primarily from the Capella Disposal Transaction as noted in Note 3 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and $7.0 million of lower interest revenue related to the conversion of certain Prime facilities, valued at approximately $100 million, from mortgage loans to direct financing leases in October 2016.  Real estate depreciation and amortization during 2017 was $125.1 million compared to $94.4 million in 2016 primarily due to the incremental depreciation/amortization from the facilities acquired in 2017 and the development properties completed in 2016 and 2017.\nIn regards to other investing and financing activities in 2017, we did the following:", "item_7_text": "Other intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values, which are based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant's lease and our overall relationship with that tenant. Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement, among other factors. At December 31, 2017, we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles.\nWe use direct financing lease (\u201cDFL\u201d) accounting to record rent on certain leases deemed to be financing leases, per accounting rules, rather than operating leases. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectability of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unearned income.\n \u2022 Completed the Capella Disposal Transaction (as fully described in Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in which we sold our equity investment, received $395 million to settle outstanding acquisition loans and received $210 million in prepayment of two mortgage loans for hospitals in Russellville, Arkansas and Lawton, Oklahoma, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $600 million; \nIn 2016, we invested or committed to invest approximately $1.8 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and quality of our healthcare portfolio, while improving our tenant concentration and expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. Furthermore, we strategically sold assets for proceeds totaling more than $800 million, refinanced $1 billion of debt, and sold 82.7 million shares generating proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion in order to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce leverage, and fund acquisitions.\n e) On May 1, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately 43.1 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $548 million. We used a portion of these proceeds to acquire eight facilities for $301.3 million (leased to Steward), a facility in Idaho for $87.5 million (leased to RCCH) and two other facilities for $40 million (leased to Alecto). \n \u2022 Operating lease revenue (including rent billed and straight-line rent) - up $132.9 million over the prior year of which $1.0 million is from annual escalations of rental rates in accordance with provisions in our leases, $120.3 million is incremental revenue from acquisitions made after December 31, 2016, $16.7 million is incremental revenue from development properties that were completed and put into service in 2016 and 2017, $3.1 million is incremental revenue from capital additions made to existing facilities in 2017 and 2016, $5.6 million relates to the conversion of certain RCCH facilities in April 2016 from direct financing leases into operating leases, and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. These increases are partially offset by $9.8 million of lower revenue related to dispositions and $4.8 million of higher straight-line rent write-offs in 2017 related to Adeptus Health and the sale of our Muskogee property. \n b) On March 4, 2017, we redeemed our \u0080200 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.750% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020. We funded this redemption, including the premium and accrued interest, with proceeds from the new \u0080200 million term loan together with cash on hand. \n i) On October 7, 2016, we sold 10.3 million shares of common stock in a private placement to Cerberus, and certain members of Steward management. We sold these shares at a price per share of $14.50, equal to the public offering price of our September 2016 equity offering, generating total proceeds of $150 million.  2015 Cash Flow Activity\n \u2022 Acquired two acute care hospitals located in Wheeling, West Virginia and Martins Ferry, Ohio for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $40 million. We simultaneously leased the facilities to Alecto Healthcare Services LLC (\u201cAlecto\u201d); and \nAcquisition expenses decreased from $46.3 million in 2016 to $29.6 million in 2017 primarily as a result of $24.8 million of acquisition expenses incurred in 2016 associated with contingent consideration adjustments involving the seller's capital gains taxes on our MEDIAN transaction in 2015. As discussed in Note 2 to Item 8\n \u2022 Replaced our previous unsecured credit facility with a new $1.3 billion unsecured revolving loan facility, a $200 million unsecured term loan facility, and a new \u0080200 million unsecured term loan facility; \n a) On February 22, 2016, we completed a senior unsecured notes offering for $500 million. \n \u2022 Completed a \u0080500 million senior unsecured notes offering in March 2017 and used a portion of the proceeds to pay off our \u0080200 million term loan; \nIncome tax expense includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based taxes and withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The provision for income taxes was a benefit of $6.8 million for 2016 compared to expense of $1.5 million for 2015. As discussed in Note 5 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the income tax benefit recognized for 2016 was primarily due to acquisition costs associated with our European investments (approximately $5.1 million) and the release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets of approximately $4 million.\nIn order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains. See section titled \u201cDistribution Policy\u201d within this Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our dividend policy along with the historical dividends paid on a per share basis.\n (2) Includes $17.4 million, $30.1 million, $37.0 million, $5.8 million, and $12.0 million in transfer and capital gains taxes in 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, related to our property acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions. \nredemptions and repurchases of our capital stock; prepay, redeem or repurchase debt; engage in mergers or consolidations; enter into affiliated transactions; dispose of real estate or other assets; and change our business. In addition, the credit agreement governing our Credit Facility limits the amount of dividends we can pay to 95% of normalized adjusted funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, on a rolling four quarter basis. The indentures governing our senior unsecured notes also limit the amount of dividends we can pay based on the sum of 95% of funds from operations, proceeds of equity issuances and certain other net cash proceeds. Finally, our senior unsecured notes require us to maintain total unencumbered assets (as defined in the related indenture) of not less than 150% of our unsecured indebtedness.\nWe begin recording base rent income from our development projects when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility, which may be different from the stated start date of the lease. Also, during construction of our development projects, we are generally entitled to accrue rent based on the cost paid during the construction period (construction period rent). We accrue construction period rent as a receivable with a\n a) On August 19, 2015, we completed a public offering of \u0080500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes. In addition, on September 30, 2015, we entered into an amendment to our amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement, dated as of June 19, 2014. The amendment, among other things, increased our revolver availability to $1.3 billion and increased borrowings under our term loan by $125 million. \nItem 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful along with a reconciliation to our GAAP earnings. </td> </tr>\nInterest expense for 2017 and 2016 totaled $177.0 million and $159.6 million, respectively. Our average debt balance for 2017 was higher than 2016 due to the continued growth of the company; however, its impact on interest expense was partially offset by lower interest rates. Our weighted average interest rate was 4.6% for 2017, down from 4.9% in 2016. See Note 4 in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our debt activities.\n a) On February 1, 2017, we replaced our previous unsecured credit facility with a new credit facility (\u201cCredit Facility\u201d) resulting in a $50 million reduction in our U.S. dollar term loan and a new \u0080200 million unsecured term loan facility (which was paid off on March 30, 2017). \n \u2022 Refinanced $1 billion of debt and sold 82.7 million shares generating proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion: \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $289.8 million compared to net income of $225.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily due to additional revenue generated from the MEDIAN, Steward, and RCCH investments made in late 2016 and throughout 2017 and incremental revenue from completed development projects, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from such new investments, approximately $54 million in higher gains on sale of properties during 2016, and higher interest expense in 2017 primarily due to the $1.4 billion 5.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $474.9 million, or $1.35 per diluted share for 2017 as compared to $334.8 million, or $1.28 per diluted share for 2016. This 41.8% increase in FFO dollars is primarily due to the increase in revenue from acquisitions and completed development projects during 2017, while FFO per share is only a 5% increase in 2017 compared to prior year due to more shares outstanding from the September 2016 and May 2017 equity offerings.\nLosses from Operating Lease Receivables: We utilize the information above along with the tenants' payment and default history in evaluating (on a property-by-property basis) whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding rent receivables is needed. A provision for losses on rent receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full. The provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral, if any.\nIn addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose normalized FFO, which adjusts FFO for items that relate to unanticipated or non-core events or activities or accounting changes that, if not noted, would make comparison to prior period results and market expectations potentially less meaningful to investors and analysts.\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\nInterest expense for 2016 and 2015 totaled $159.6 million and $120.9 million, respectively. This increase was related to higher average debt balances in the current year associated with our 4.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 entered into in August 2015 and our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024 entered into in February 2016 and our expanded credit facility. In addition, we incurred $1.7 million in additional interest expense in 2016 between the time we issued the $500 million 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 in July 2016 and when we were able to redeem the $450 million 6.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021 in August 2016. Our weighted average interest rate was 4.9% for 2016, up from 4.3% in 2015 due to more permanent debt financing in 2016 and higher LIBOR rates. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our debt activities.\n2017 Highlights\n \u2022 Operating lease revenue (including rent billed and straight-line rent) - up $97.4 million over the prior year of which $0.2 million was from our annual escalation provisions in our leases, $69.6 million was from incremental revenue from acquisitions made in 2016 (including $15.0 million related to Steward), $20.2 million was incremental revenue from development properties that were completed and put into service in 2016 and 2015, and $2.1 million was from capital additions at our existing facilities during 2016. The increase was also attributable to $15.0 million earned on our Capella properties after lease reclassification from DFL to operating lease accounting as part of the April 29, 2016 amendments. These increases were partially offset by $10.3 million of lower revenues from the 2016 dispositions. \n \u2022 Acquired 15 acute care hospitals, one rehabilitation hospital, and one behavioral health facility, completed mortgage financing on two acute care hospitals, and invested in an additional minority equity contribution in Steward for an aggregate investment of $1.8 billion; \n \u2022 Income from direct financing leases - up $10.2 million over the prior year of which $0.8 million is from annual escalations of rental rates in accordance with provisions in our leases, $4.8 million is incremental revenue from acquisitions made after December 31, 2016, and $9.8 million relates to the conversion of certain Prime facilities in October 2016 from mortgage loans to direct financing leases. These increases were partially offset by $5.2 million of net revenue earned in 2016 but not in 2017 from those RCCH facilities that converted from direct financing leases into operating leases in the first half of 2016. \n (1) The 2017 column reflects a commitment to acquire an RCCH facility post December 31, 2017. The 2016 column includes post December 31, 2016 transactions and commitments such as two RCCH facilities and 14 facilities in Germany. \n \u2022 Acquired (or committed to acquire) real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $1.8 billion as noted below: \n (2) As of December 31, 2017, we have a $1.3 billion revolving credit facility. However, this table assumes the balance outstanding under the revolver and rate in effect at December 31, 2017 (which was $840.8 million as of December 31, 2017) remains in effect through maturity. \nA summary of our 2016 highlights is as follows:\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nWith the redemption of the $450 million in senior unsecured notes, we incurred $22.5 million in debt refinancing charges ($15.5 million of which was a redemption premium) during 2016. During 2015, we incurred $4.4 million of charges primarily related to structuring and underwriting fees associated with the bridge loan entered into as a back stop on financing the original Capella acquisition.\n \u2022 Completed the sale-leaseback transaction (step 2 of the initial transaction in 2014) of 31 MEDIAN facilities in Germany for an aggregate purchase price of \u0080646 million; \nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values, if any, for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. We amortize any resulting capitalized above-market lease values as a reduction of rental income over lease term. We amortize any resulting capitalized below-market lease values as an increase to rental income over the lease term. Because our strategy to a large degree involves the origination and acquisition of long-term lease arrangements at market rates with independent parties, we do not expect the above-market and below-market in-place lease values to be significant for many of our transactions.\n \u2022 Sold the real estate of an acute care facility in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for a net gain of $7.4 million. \nThese investments include the following at December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nWe intend to pay to our stockholders, within the time periods prescribed by the Code, all or substantially all of our annual REIT taxable income, including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities. It is our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code and to avoid corporate income and excise taxes on undistributed income. However, our Credit Facility limits the amounts of dividends we can pay - see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n \u2022 Acquired real estate assets (or committed to acquire real estate assets), entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $1.8 billion as noted below: \nThe following table summarizes known material contractual obligations (including interest) as of December 31, 2017, excluding the impact of subsequent events (amounts in thousands):\n \u2022 Acquired 12 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in Germany for a combined purchase price of \u008085.2 million and committed \u0080174.6 million to acquire 14 additional inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. These facilities are leased to MEDIAN or its affiliates; \n (3) The 2016 column includes a $9.1 million tax benefit generated from the reversal of foreign valuation allowances and acquisition expenses incurred by certain international subsidiaries. \nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nInvestors and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations, or FFO, as a supplemental performance measure. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) on sales of real estate and impairment charges on real estate assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nReal estate depreciation and amortization during 2016 was $94.4 million compared to $69.9 million in 2015 primarily due to the incremental depreciation/amortization from the facilities acquired in 2016 and the development properties completed in 2015 and 2016. In the 2016 second quarter, we accelerated the amortization of the lease intangible asset related to our Corinth facility resulting in $1.1 million of additional expense. This was offset by a similar $1.1 million of expense in 2015 to accelerate the amortization of lease intangible assets associated with Twelve Oaks, Luling, and Healthtrax properties.\n d) On March 31, 2017, we sold the EASTAR Health System real estate located in Muskogee, Oklahoma, which was leased to RCCH. Total proceeds from this transaction were approximately $64 million resulting in a gain of $7.4 million. \nWe continually evaluate all of our transactions and investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a variable interest entity. If we determine that we have a variable interest in a variable interest entity, we then evaluate if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether we have the ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. We consolidate each variable interest entity in which we, by virtue of or transactions with our investments in the entity, are considered to be the primary beneficiary. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entity in which we hold a variable interest (such as Ernest) because we do not control the activities (such as the day-to-day operations of the hospital) that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities.\n b) On August 11, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 28.75 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $337 million, after deducting estimated offering expenses. \n2016 Highlights\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2016 totaled $48.9 million, which was 9.0% of revenues, down from 9.9% of revenues in the prior year. The decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to our business model as we can generally increase our revenues significantly without increasing our headcount and related expense at the same rate. On a dollar basis, general and administrative expenses were up $5.3 million from the prior year due to higher international administrative expenses, and to a lesser extent personnel and travel costs, which were up as a result of the growth and expansion of our company.\nStock-Based Compensation: During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recorded $9.9 million, $7.9 million, and $11.1 million, respectively, of expense for share-based compensation related to grants of restricted common stock and other stock-based awards. Starting in 2010, we granted annual performance-based restricted share awards that vest based on the achievement of certain market conditions as defined by the accounting rules. Typical market conditions for our awards are based on our total shareholder return (factoring in stock price appreciation and dividends paid) including comparisons of our total shareholder returns to an index of other REIT stocks. Because these awards are earned based on the achievement of these market conditions, we must initially evaluate and estimate the probability of achieving these market conditions in order to determine the fair value of the award and over what period we should recognize stock compensation expense. Because of the complexities inherently involved with these awards, we work with an independent consultant to assist us in modeling both the value of the award and the various periods over which each tranche of an award will be earned. We use what is termed a Monte Carlo simulation model, which determines a value and earnings periods based on multiple outcomes and their probabilities. We record expense over the expected or derived vesting periods using the calculated value of the awards. We record expense over these vesting periods even though the awards have not yet been earned and, in fact, may never be earned - such as was the case with our 2015 performance awards in which 348,938 shares were forfeited because the related market conditions were not achieved for the period of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. If awards vest faster than our original estimate, we will record a catch-up of expense.\nEarnings from our equity interests declined from $2.8 million of income in the 2015 to a loss of $1.1 million in 2016. The loss in 2016 includes approximately $5.4 million of one-time acquisition expenses, representing our share of such expenses incurred by our Italian joint venture to acquire its eight hospital properties. Excluding these acquisition expenses, our earnings from our equity interest would have been $4.3 million, an increase over 2015 due to $3.4 million of income from our Italian joint venture (no such income was recorded in 2015).\nLosses on DFL Receivables: Allowances are established for DFLs based upon an estimate of probable losses on a property-by-property basis. DFLs are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the lease. Like operating lease receivables, the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's overall financial condition; economic resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the DFL's effective interest rate, fair value of collateral, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. DFLs are placed on non-accrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. If on non-accrual status, we generally account for the DFLs on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash.\n \u2022 issuing of new USD or EUR denominated debt securities, including senior unsecured notes; and/or \n e) On June 17, 2016, we sold our investment in one property leased and operated by Corinth Investor Holdings for $28 million. \nPrincipal payments due on our debt (which exclude the effects of any discounts, premiums, or debt issue costs recorded) are as follows ($ amounts in thousands):\n On February 15, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock to be paid on April 12, 2018, to stockholders of record on March 15, 2018.\nIn regards to other financing activities in which we used such net proceeds to ultimately fund our approximate $1.5 billion of acquisitions in 2016 and the remainder of our development activities, we did the following:\n c) On January 14, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 34.5 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $480 million, after deducting estimated offering expenses.  Debt Restrictions and REIT Requirements\ncorresponding offset to deferred revenue during the construction period. When the lessee takes physical possession of the facility, we begin recognizing the deferred construction period revenue on the straight-line method over the remaining term of the lease.\n \u2022 Sold the remaining 14.9 million shares under our January 2014 at-the-market equity offering program resulting in net proceeds of approximately $224 million; \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to MPT common stockholders to FFO and normalized FFO for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013 ($ amounts in thousands except per share data):\nLoans: Loans consist of mortgage loans, working capital loans and other long-term loans. Mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property. Working capital and other long-term loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees. We record loans at cost. We evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal on a loan-by-loan basis (using the same process as we do\nWe generated cash of $363 million from operating activities during 2017, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $326.7 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\n\nIn 2015, we held an equity investment in Capella (now RCCH) similar to our Ernest equity investment. We accounted for this investment under the fair value option election as well. We recorded no unrealized gain/loss on this investment in 2015 and through April 2016. In April 2016, we sold our Capella equity investment at cost resulting in no recognized gain/loss.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we had various dispositions resulting in a net gain on sale of real estate and other asset dispositions of $61.2 million and impairment charges of $7.2 million (see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\n b) On March 1, 2016, we updated our at-the-market equity program, which gave us the ability to sell up to $227 million of stock with a commission rate of 1.25%. During 2016, we sold approximately 15 million shares of our common stock under this program, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $224 million, after deducting expenses of approximately $2.8 million of commissions. \nHowever, in order to fund our investment strategies and to fund debt maturities coming due in later years, we believe the following sources of capital are generally available in the market and we may access one or a combination of them:\n c) On April 30, 2016, we closed on the Capella Disposal Transaction (as further discussed in Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) resulting in net proceeds of $550 million along with an additional $50 million once we sold our investment in RegionalCare Hospital Partners, Inc. bonds in June 2016. \n \u2022 Sold investments in real estate and equity interests and received payments in full on loans for proceeds of more than $800 million as noted below: \nIncome tax expense includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based taxes and withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The provision for income taxes was an expense of $2.7 million for 2017 compared to a benefit of $6.8 million for 2016. As discussed in Note 5 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the income tax benefit recognized for 2016 was primarily due to acquisition costs associated with our European investments and the release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets of approximately $4 million. We continue to reflect a valuation allowance against our U.S. and certain foreign net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017.\nWe also receive additional rent (contingent rent) under some leases based on increases in CPI or where CPI exceeds the annual minimum percentage increase as stipulated in the lease. Contingent rents are recorded as rent billed revenue in the period earned.\nEarnings from our equity interests increased from a loss of $1.1 million in 2016 to income of $10.1 million in 2017. The loss in 2016 includes approximately $5.4 million of one-time acquisition expenses, representing our share of such expenses incurred by our Italian joint venture to acquire its eight hospital properties. The remaining difference of $5.8 million is from additional income related to our increased ownership in and improved operating results of the operator of our Hoboken facility, along with additional income from our IMED Group investment in which the underlying facility began operations on March 31, 2017.\n \u2022 Executed a $19 million agreement to develop an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Toledo, Ohio, acquired an inpatient rehabilitation facility and a long-term acute care hospital in Lubbock, Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $31.5 million, and acquired an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Weslaco, Texas for $10.7 million all leased to Ernest; \n Total Gross Assets\nIn addition to these restrictions, the Credit Facility contains customary financial and operating covenants, including covenants relating to our total leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, secured leverage ratio, unsecured leverage ratio, consolidated adjusted net worth, and unsecured interest coverage ratio. This facility also contains customary events of default, including among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, material inaccuracy of representations and failure to comply with our covenants. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the facility, the entire outstanding balance may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all such financial and operating covenants.\n d) On May 23, 2016, we sold our investment in five properties leased and operated by Post Acute Medical for $71 million. \nProperty expenses for 2016 decreased $1.1 million compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the reimbursement of $0.8 million from the tenant of our Twelve Oaks facility for property expenses incurred in previous periods.\nfor assessing the collectability of rents as discussed above) to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the allowance is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to either the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the loans effective interest rate or to the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent.\n2015 Highlights\nAcquisition expenses decreased from $61.3 million in 2015 to $46.3 million in 2016 primarily as a result of $31.7 million in lower real estate transfer taxes associated with our international acquisitions. This decrease was partially offset by $24.8 million of acquisition expenses incurred in 2016 associated with contingent consideration adjustments involving the seller's capital gains taxes on our MEDIAN transaction in 2015.\n \u2022 Sold the real estate of three inpatient rehabilitation hospitals located in Texas, for proceeds of $111.5 million, resulting in a net gain of approximately $45 million. \n \u2022 amending or entering into new bank term loans; \nA summary of our 2015 highlights is as follows:\n (3) Most of our contractual obligations to make operating lease payments are related to ground leases for which we are reimbursed by our tenants along with corporate office and equipment leases. \nAs of February 28, 2018, we have no debt principal payments due between now and January 2021 when our revolving credit facility comes due (which can be extended by one year). With our liquidity as of February 28, 2018 of approximately $0.6 billion, along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest and availability under our at-the-market equity program, we believe we have the liquidity available for us to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements, and our purchase obligations included in the \u201cContractual Obligations\u201d schedule for the foreseeable future.\nvalued as if vacant when acquired. Management's estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which we expect to be about six months (based on experience) depending on specific local market conditions. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal costs, and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction.\n</table>\n \u2022 Completed $30 million mortgage financing to Prime for a general acute care hospital in Port Huron, Michigan and subsequently converted a portion of the loan to real estate for $20 million, which reduced the mortgage loan accordingly; \n \u2022 Increased our credit facility (that was in place in 2015) to $1.95 billion comprised of a $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and a $250 million senior unsecured term loan facility along with a $400 million accordion feature, issued \u0080500 million of unsecured notes, and raised $817 million in equity to fund the acquisition activity mentioned above. \nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year that began on April 6, 2004 and ended on December 31, 2004. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gain, to our stockholders. It is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain such status going forward.\nOur mortgage and acquisition loans with Ernest are recorded at fair value based on Level 2 inputs by discounting the estimated cash flows using the market rates which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and the same remaining maturities. Our equity investment in Ernest is recorded at fair value based on Level 3 inputs, by using a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates of our investee such as projected revenue and expenses and appropriate consideration of the underlying risk profile of the forecasted assumptions associated with the investee. We classify the equity investment as Level 3, as we use certain unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement, and the valuation requires management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. For the cash flow\n ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nIn regards to other financing activities in which we used such net proceeds to ultimately fund our approximate $1.8 billion of acquisitions in 2015 and the remainder of our development activities, we did the following:\nAcquired Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation: For properties acquired for leasing purposes, we currently account for such acquisitions based on business combination accounting rules. We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we may utilize a number of sources, including available real estate broker data, independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, internal data from previous acquisitions or developments, and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\n g) On July 20, 2016, we sold three facilities leased to HealthSouth Corporation for $111.5 million. \nWe were incorporated in Maryland on August 27, 2003, primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net-leased healthcare facilities. We also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants. We conduct our business operations in one segment. We have healthcare investments in the U.S. and Europe. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 U.S. federal income tax return. Our existing tenants are, and our prospective tenants will generally be, healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations. We offer financing for these operators' real estate through 100% lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long-term basis ranging from 10 to 15 years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers. We also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases. Our existing portfolio's minimum escalators range from 0.5% to 4%, while less than 3% of our properties do not have an escalator. Most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases. In addition to rent or mortgage interest, our leases and loans typically require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility. Some leases also may require our tenants to pay percentage rents, which are based on the tenant's revenues from their operations. Finally, we may acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in the tenant's income or loss.\n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Lewiston, Idaho for $87.5 million. This facility is leased to RCCH; \nAs of February 28, 2018, we have no debt principal payments due in 2018 - see debt maturity schedule below. At February 28, 2018, our availability under our revolving credit facility plus cash on-hand approximated $0.6 billion. We believe this liquidity along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest and availability under our at-the-market equity program is sufficient to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, our purchase obligations as disclosed in the \u201cContractual Obligations\u201d schedule earlier, and dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements for the next twelve months.\nWe consider non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of financial performance, financial position or cash\n \u2022 Acquired 17 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and one acute care hospital in Germany for a combined purchase price of \u0080274 million. These facilities are leased to MEDIAN or its affiliates; \nWe generated cash of $207.0 million from operating activities during 2015, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $183.0 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\nWhen circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments, we review the recoverability of the facility's carrying value. The review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, from the facility's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends, and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis, such as was the case with our Monroe and Bucks facilities in 2014, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility. We do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at December 31, 2017; however, given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken.\n \u2022 placing new secured loans on real estate located in the U.S. and/or Europe.  However, there is no assurance that conditions will be favorable for such possible transactions or that our plans will be successful.\nIn arriving at the DLOM, we started with a DLOM range based on the results of studies supporting valuation discounts for other transactions or structures without a public market. To select the appropriate DLOM within the range, we then considered many qualitative factors including the percent of control, the nature of the underlying investee's business along with our rights as an investor pursuant to the operating agreement, the size of investment, expected holding period, number of shareholders, access to capital marketplace, etc. To illustrate the effect of movements in the DLOM, we performed a sensitivity analysis below by using basis point variations (dollars in thousands):\nOur operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year due to a variety of reasons including acquisitions made during the year, incremental revenues and expenses from acquisitions made in the prior year, revenues and expenses from completed development properties, property disposals, annual escalation provisions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, new or amended debt agreements, issuances of shares through an equity offering, etc. Thus, our operating results for the current year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future years.\n \u2022 Interest and fee income - down $3.7 million over the prior year, which was attributable to $22.9 million in interest earned in 2015 from loans that were converted to real estate on or before December 31, 2016, in connection with the MEDIAN Transaction and $1.1 million related to loan pay downs in 2016. The decrease was partially offset by $18.0 million of additional interest from other loans made during 2016, including the Prime mortgage loans, $2.1 million of interest on the Capella mortgage and acquisition loans that were outstanding longer in 2016 than in 2015, and $0.4 million in annual escalation provisions of our loans. \n (2) Includes $137.4 million and $109.1 million of unfunded amounts on ongoing development projects and $16.8 million and $84.9 million of unfunded amounts on capital improvement projects and development projects that have commenced rent, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Distribution Policy\n \u2022 Completed a $500 million senior unsecured notes offering in July 2016 and used the proceeds to redeem our $450 million 6.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021; \n \u2022 Completed construction and began recording rental income on 17 acute care facilities in Texas, Arizona, and Colorado with Adeptus Health totaling approximately $102.6 million and an acute care facility and a medical office building in Birmingham, Alabama with UAB Medical West totaling $8.6 million. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold the Muskogee, Oklahoma facility resulting in a net gain on sale of real estate of $7.4 million, while in 2016, we had various dispositions resulting in a net gain on sale of real estate and other asset dispositions of $61.2 million and impairment charges of $7.2 million (see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\n \u2022 Sold the real estate of a long-term acute care facility in Corinth, Texas, for proceeds of $28 million; and \n Our total revenue for 2017 is up $163.6 million or 30.2% over the prior year. This increase is made up of the following:\n \u2022 To fund our over $2.2 billion of asset investments, while lowering our average interest cost, we successfully refinanced approximately $0.6 billion of debt, and generated proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion from the sale of 43.1 million shares in an equity offering and through new issuances of unsecured notes. Details of such activities are as follows: \n \u2022 Sold the real estate of five properties (three of which were in Texas and two in Louisiana), received payment in full for outstanding loans, and recovered our investment in operations for proceeds of $71 million, resulting in a net gain of approximately $15 million; \n f) On September 7, 2017, we completed a senior unsecured notes offering for $1.4 billion. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the 5.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 offering to redeem the $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022, plus a redemption premium, on October 7, 2017. The remaining proceeds, plus borrowings on our revolving credit facility, were used to acquire nine facilities and ancillary properties leased to Steward for $700 million, to make mortgage on two properties for $700 million and to make a $100 million equity investment in Steward. \n c) On March 24, 2017, we completed a senior unsecured notes offering for \u0080500 million. We used the net proceeds from this offering to prepay and extinguish the new \u0080200 million term loan with the remainder of the proceeds used to acquire 12 facilities leased to MEDIAN for \u0080146.4 million. \nWith the redemption of the $450 million in senior unsecured notes, we incurred $22.5 million in debt refinancing charges ($15.5 million of which was a redemption premium) during 2016. During 2017, we incurred $32.6 million of debt refinancing charges related to the replacement of our credit facility, the payoff of our \u0080200 million term loan, the payoff of our \u0080200 million euro bonds, the prepayment of our $350 million senior unsecured notes, and structuring and underwriting fees associated with the termination of the short-term loan commitment we made in anticipation of the Steward transaction in 2017.\nUnless otherwise indicated, references to \u201cour,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MPT Operating Partnership, L.P.\nDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\n \u2022 Closed on the final MEDIAN property, as part of the initial MEDIAN transaction, for a purchase price of \u008041.6 million. See \u201c2015 Activity\u201d for a description of the initial MEDIAN Transaction; \n \u2022 Executed an additional $250 million agreement with Adeptus Health for the development of acute care hospitals and free-standing emergency departments; and \nIn 2017, we invested or committed to invest approximately $2.2 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and scale of our healthcare portfolio, while expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. and extending our lease and mortgage loan maturity schedule. Furthermore, we strategically sold an asset for proceeds totaling $64 million, raised $548 million in proceeds from a successful equity offering, and refinanced approximately $0.6 billion of debt in order to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce interest rates, and fund acquisitions. Finally, we increased our dividend to $0.24 per share per quarter in 2017 - the third year in a row for such an increase.\n (4) Includes approximately $140 million of future expenditures related to development projects, a $17.5 million commitment to acquire one RCCH facility post December 31, 2017 and future expenditures on commenced capital improvement projects. We have excluded from the table above $312.2 million of capital expenditure commitments in our leases that we are not definitive on the amount, timing, and certainty of funding. However, payment on any of these commitments, if made, would be added to the lease base upon which the lessee will pay us rents.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n We measure the estimated fair value of most of these investments utilizing Level 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Under current accounting guidance, Level 3 represents fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\n \u2022 sale of equity securities; \nWe amortize the value of lease intangibles to expense over the term of the respective leases, which have a weighted average useful life of 26.5 years at December 31, 2017. If a lease is terminated, the unamortized portion of the lease intangible is charged to expense as was the case with our Twelve Oaks property in 2015.\n Our total revenue for 2016 was up $99.3 million or 22.5% over the prior year. This increase was made up of the following:\n \u2022 Completed the sale leaseback transaction converting the remaining $93.3 million RCCH acquisition loan on the Olympia, Washington property to real estate, including funding an additional $7 million; and \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n \u2022 Initiated long term relationship with AXA Real Estate Investment Managers to co-invest with AXA-advised accounts for the acquisition of acute care hospitals in Spain and Italy via a joint venture arrangement; \nFair Value Option Election: We elected to account for certain investments acquired on February 29, 2012, as part of the Ernest transaction, using the fair value option method, which means we mark these investments to fair market value on a recurring basis. Any changes in the fair value of these investments are non-cash adjustments that will not impact our financial condition or cash flows unless we decided to liquidate these investments.\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we expect acquisition expenses to significantly decrease in 2018 with adoption of the new accounting standard that should allow us to capitalize a significant majority of these acquisition costs.\n \u2022 Sold 10.3 million shares of common stock in a private placement, generating total proceeds of $150 million. \nRevenue Recognition: We receive income from operating leases based on the fixed, minimum required rents (base rents) per the lease agreements. Rent revenue from base rents is recorded on the straight-line method over the terms of the related lease agreements for new leases and the remaining terms of existing leases for those acquired as part of a property acquisition. The straight-line method records the periodic average amount of base rent earned over the term of a lease, taking into account contractual rent adjustments over the lease term. The straight-line method typically has the effect of recording more rent revenue from a lease than a tenant is required to pay early in the term of the lease. During the later parts of a lease term, this effect reverses with less rent revenue recorded than a tenant is required to pay. Rent revenue, as recorded on the straight-line method, in the consolidated statements of income is presented as two amounts: rent billed revenue and straight-line revenue. Rent billed revenue is the amount of base rent actually billed to the customer each period as required by the lease. Straight-line rent revenue is the difference between rent revenue earned based on the straight-line method and the amount recorded as rent billed revenue. We record the difference between base rent revenues earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements, as applicable, as an increase or decrease to straight-line rent receivable.\nWe expect to lower our outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility, improve our leverage metrics, and reduce our tenant concentration in Steward during 2018. We expect to accomplish this by entering into joint venture arrangements, and/or completing strategic property sales, among other alternatives. However, no assurance can be made that such transactions will be available to us or that our plans will be successful.\nIn order to prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) in the U.S., we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances. We believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of our revenues, credit losses, fair values (either as part of a purchase price allocation, impairment analysis or in valuing certain of our equity investments), periodic depreciation of our real estate assets, and stock compensation expense, along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results, have significant effects on our financial statements. Each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments. We rely on our experience, collect historical and current market data, and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. See Note 2 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policies and recent accounting developments. Our accounting estimates include the following:\nA summary of our 2017 highlights is as follows:\n\n Because the fair value of Ernest investments noted above is below our original cost, we recognized an unrealized loss in 2017. No unrealized gain/loss on the Ernest investments were recorded in previous years.\nWe believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and the use of normalized FFO makes comparisons of our operating results with prior periods and other companies more meaningful. While FFO and normalized FFO are relevant and widely used supplemental measures of operating and financial performance of REITs, they should not be viewed as a substitute measure of our operating performance since the measures do not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which can be significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations. FFO and normalized FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2017, our portfolio consisted of 275 properties leased or loaned to 31 operators, of which three are under development and 14 are in the form of mortgage loans.\nCommitment fees received from lessee for development and leasing services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the initial term of a lease to produce a constant effective yield on the lease (interest method). Commitment and origination fees from lending services are also recorded as deferred revenue initially and recognized as income over the life of the loan using the interest method.\nTotal gross assets is total assets before accumulated depreciation/amortization and assumes all real estate binding commitments on new investments and unfunded amounts on development deals and commenced capital improvement projects are fully funded, and assumes cash on hand is fully used in these transactions. We believe total gross assets is useful to investors as it provides a more current view of our portfolio and allows for a better understanding of our concentration levels as our binding commitments close and our other commitments are fully funded. The following table presents a reconciliation of total assets to total gross assets (in thousands):\n h) On November 13, 2017, we entered into a new at-the-market equity program, which gives us the ability to sell up to $750 million of stock with a commission rate of up to 2.0%. We did not sell any shares under this program in 2017.  2016 Cash Flow Activity\nOverview\nProperty expenses for 2017 increased $3 million compared to 2016 primarily due to the growth of our business internationally. In addition, property expenses for 2016 were lower than normal due to the reimbursement of $0.8 million from the tenant of our Twelve Oaks facility for property expenses incurred in 2015.\n \u2022 Provided $100 million mortgage financing to Prime for three general acute care hospitals and one free-standing emergency department in New Jersey and acquired two general acute care hospitals in the Kansas City area for $110 million; \n h) On September 30, 2016, we completed a public offering of 57.5 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $799.5 million, after deducting offering expenses. \n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 43.1 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $548 million, after deducting estimated offering expenses. \n \u2022 Acquired a portfolio of five acute care hospitals and completed mortgage financing on four acute care hospitals in Massachusetts and invested in a minority equity contribution in Steward for an aggregate investment of $1.25 billion; \nLosses from Rent Receivables: For all leases, we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including, but not limited to: admission levels and surgery/procedure volumes by type; current operating margins; ratio of our tenants' operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs; trends in revenue, cash collections, and patient mix; and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations on tenants' profitability and liquidity.\n2017 Cash Flow Activity\nThe table below is a summary of our distributions declared for the three year period ended December 31, 2017:\nFunds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations\n \u2022 Completed a $1.4 billion senior unsecured notes offering in September 2017 with a rate of 5.000% and used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022; \n f) On July 13, 2016, we completed a new $500 million senior unsecured notes offering. We used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem our $450 million 6.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021, which was completed on August 12, 2016. Net proceeds from the notes offering and redemption approximated $19 million, and we incurred a one-time charge of $22.5 million related to the redemption (see Note 4 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). \n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Newark, New Jersey, from Prime for an aggregate purchase price of $63.0 million and committed to advance an additional $30 million to Prime over a three-year period to be used solely for capital additions to the real estate; any such addition will be added to the basis upon which the lessee will pay us rents; \n \u2022 Income from direct financing leases - up $5.6 million over the prior year of which $0.8 million was from annual escalation provisions in our leases and $6.7 million was from incremental revenue from acquisitions made in 2016. This increase was also attributable to $0.3 million of incremental revenue on the Capella properties prior to lease reclassification. The increase was partially offset by the $2.6 million write-off of DFL non-cash income in connection with the Capella lease reclassification (see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details). \nIn regards to the underlying projection of revenues and expenses used in the discounted cash flow model, such projections are provided by Ernest. However, we will modify such projections (including underlying assumptions used) as needed based on our review and analysis of their historical results, meetings with key members of management, and our understanding of trends and developments within the healthcare industry.\n \u2022 Committed to purchase two acute care hospitals in Washington and Idaho for an aggregate purchase price of $105 million, which will be leased to RCCH. \nWe selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our TRSs, which the operators use for acquisitions and working capital. We consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons: (1) it provides opportunities to make income-earning investments that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise, and (2) by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators, we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of, and financing sources for, healthcare facilities.\nWe measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with new or in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property\n \u2022 proceeds from strategic property sales; \nmodel, our observable inputs include use of a capitalization rate, discount rate (which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital), and market interest rates, and our unobservable input includes an adjustment for a marketability discount (\u201cDLOM\u201d) on our equity investment of 40% at December 31, 2017.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nWe receive interest income from our tenants/borrowers on mortgage loans, working capital loans, and other long-term loans. Interest income from these loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal outstanding and terms of the loans.\n \u2022 Acquired real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $2.2 billion as noted below: \nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2017 totaled $58.6 million, which is 8.3% of revenues, down from 9.0% of revenues in the prior year. The decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to our business model as we can generally increase our revenues significantly without increasing our head count and related expense at the same rate. On a dollar basis, general and administrative expenses were up $9.7 million from the prior year due primarily to increases in travel, international administration, costs associated with opening/maintaining a European office, compensation related to increased headcount and public company board expenses.\nInvestments in Real Estate: We maintain our investments in real estate at cost, and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. While our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility, to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance, we expense those costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the weighted average useful life of approximately 39.1 years for buildings and improvements.\n \u2022 Prepaid the principal amount of the mortgage loan on our property in Kansas City, Missouri at par in the amount of $12.9 million; and \nIn 2015, we invested or committed to invest approximately $1.8 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments greatly strengthened our portfolio through geographic, tenant and property type diversification. We expanded total assets by 51%, increased revenues by 41%, and lowered our general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue to less than 10%.\nWe own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding receivables. We have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources, except those described above under \u201cDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\u201d.\nWe generated cash of $264.7 million from operating activities during 2016, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $218.4 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $225.0 million compared to net income of $139.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to additional revenue generated from our new investments and from completed development projects, $61.2 million of gains on real estate and other disposals, and a $15 million reduction in acquisition expenses, partially offset by higher debt refinancing costs and interest expense in 2016. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in\nOur debt facilities impose certain restrictions on us, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to: incur debt; create or incur liens; provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other entity; make\nthe section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $334.8 million, or $1.28 per diluted share for 2016 as compared to $274.8 million, or $1.26 per diluted share for 2015, a 2% increase on a per share basis. This increase in FFO per share was primarily due to additional revenue from new investments, partially offset by the loss of income from properties disposed of in 2016, higher interest costs and an increase in the number of shares outstanding during 2016 to fund such new investments.\n \u2022 Acquired the original Capella hospital portfolio (now RCCH) including seven acute care hospitals throughout the U.S. and obtained a stake in their operations for a combined total of approximately $900 million. Also, acquired an eighth facility (Kershaw) for $35 million later in the year. \n \u2022 Sold the real estate of a long-term acute care facility in Luling, Texas, and real estate of six wellness centers in the U.S. for a net gain; and \n g) On September 29, 2017, we prepaid the principal amount of the mortgage loan on our property in Kansas City, Missouri at par in the amount of $12.9 million. To fund such prepayment, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon, we used borrowings from the revolving credit facility. \nLong-term Liquidity Requirements:\n \u2022 entering into joint venture arrangements; \n \u2022 Acquired a 266-bed outpatient rehabilitation clinic located in Hannover, Germany from MEDIAN for \u008018.7 million; \n \u2022 Redeemed our 5.750% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020 using proceeds from our \u0080200 million term loan and cash on hand; \nShort-term Liquidity Requirements:\nWith these transactions, our weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2017, improved to 4.42% versus 4.87% at December 31, 2016.\n Results of Operations\nPrinciples of Consolidation: Property holding entities and other subsidiaries of which we own 100% of the equity or have a controlling financial interest evidenced by ownership of a majority voting interest are consolidated. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. For entities in which we own less than 100% of the equity interest, we consolidate the property if we have the direct or indirect ability to control the entities' activities based upon the terms of the respective entities' ownership agreements. For these entities, we record a non-controlling interest representing equity held by non-controlling interests.\n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 57.5 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $799.5 million, after deducting estimated offering expenses; and \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nflows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Described below are the non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n \u2022 Completed a $500 million senior unsecured notes offering in February 2016 and used the proceeds to reduce our outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility; \n \u2022 Completed the sale leaseback transaction with Prime converting our existing mortgage loan on three general acute care hospitals and one free-standing emergency department in New Jersey to real estate, for an aggregate investment of $115 million; \n \u2022 Executed agreements totaling more than $150 million with Circle Health Group and Surgery Partners, Inc. to develop acute care hospitals in Birmingham, England and Idaho Falls, Idaho, respectively.  With these new investments, we expanded our gross assets to $9.5 billion, increased the total number of properties in our portfolio to 275, and increased our total number of beds to more than 32 thousand, as of December 31, 2017.\n (1) Our 4.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 and 3.325% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025 are euro-denominated. A portion of our revolver is British pound-denominated. We used the exchange rate at December 31, 2017 (1.2005 for euros and 1.3513 for British pounds) in preparing this table. \n \u2022 Interest from loans - up $20.5 million over the prior year of which $1.5 million is from annual escalations in interest rates in accordance with loan provisions and $47.6 million is incremental revenue from new loans (primarily Steward mortgage loans made in October 2016 and September 2017). These increases were partially offset by $21.8 million in less interest revenue earned in 2017 from loans that were repaid in 2016 (primarily from the Capella Disposal Transaction as noted in Note 3 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and $7.0 million of lower interest revenue related to the conversion of certain Prime facilities, valued at approximately $100 million, from mortgage loans to direct financing leases in October 2016.  Real estate depreciation and amortization during 2017 was $125.1 million compared to $94.4 million in 2016 primarily due to the incremental depreciation/amortization from the facilities acquired in 2017 and the development properties completed in 2016 and 2017.\nIn regards to other investing and financing activities in 2017, we did the following:", "item_7_tables": "Table 197: <table> <tr> <td>
