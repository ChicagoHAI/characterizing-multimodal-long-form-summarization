Risk Factors.\nThe Companies' forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are made. The Companies caution the reader not to place undue reliance on their forward-looking statements because the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and projections about future events may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. The Companies undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\nAccounting Matters\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nDominion Energy has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion Energy has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.\nAccounting for Regulated Operations\nThe accounting for Dominion Energy's regulated electric and gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that Dominion Energy is required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service\nrate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred.\nDominion Energy evaluates whether or not recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable as well as whether a regulatory liability due to customers is probable and makes various assumptions in its analyses. These analyses are generally based on:\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation and judicial actions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Past experience; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Forecasted earnings; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Considerations around the likelihood of impacts from events such as unusual weather conditions, extreme weather events and other natural disasters and unplanned outages of facilities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. A regulatory liability, if considered probable, will be recorded in the period such assessment is made or reversed into earnings if no longer probable. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nDominion Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred or when sufficient information becomes available to determine fair value and are generally capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 47\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nabsence of quoted market prices, Dominion Energy estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation or credit-adjusted risk free rates in the future, may be significant. When Dominion Energy revises any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset for assets that are in service; for assets that have ceased operations, Dominion Energy adjusts the carrying amount of the ARO liability with such changes recognized in income.\nDominion Energy's AROs include a significant balance related to the future decommissioning of its merchant and utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and Contracted Generation. At December 31, 2019, Dominion Energy's nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $1.7 billion. The following discusses critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs associated with Dominion Energy's nuclear decommissioning obligations.\nDominion Energy obtains from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for its nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. These cash flows include estimates on timing of decommissioning, which for regulated nuclear units factors in the probability of NRC approval for license extensions. In addition, Dominion Energy's cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. Dominion Energy determines cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be critical assumptions.\nIncome Taxes\nJudgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related\nassets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws, including the provisions of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. In addition, the states in which the Companies operate may or may not conform to some or all the provisions in the 2017 Tax Reform Act. Ultimate resolution or clarification of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related\nassets and liabilities could be material.\nGiven the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-\nthan-not\nrecognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December 31, 2019, Dominion Energy had $175 million of unrecognized tax benefits. Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion Energy evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. Dominion Energy establishes a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not\nthat all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2019, Dominion Energy had established $161 million of valuation allowances.\nThe 2017 Tax Reform Act included a broad range of tax reform provisions affecting the Companies, including changes in corporate tax rates and business deductions. Many of these provisions differ significantly from prior U.S. tax law, resulting in pervasive financial reporting implications for the Companies. The 2017 Tax Reform Act included significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including amendments which significantly change the taxation of individuals and business entities and included specific provisions related to regulated public utilities. The more significant changes that impact the Companies included in the 2017 Tax Reform Act are (i) reducing the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) effective in 2018, limiting the deductibility of interest expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income for certain businesses with any disallowed interest allowed to be carried forward indefinitely; (iii) permitting 100% expensing (100% bonus depreciation) for certain qualified property; (iv) eliminating the deduction for qualified domestic production activities; and (v) limiting the utilization of net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward. The specific provisions related to regulated public utilities in the 2017 Tax Reform Act generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, the exclusion from full expensing for tax purposes of certain property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and continued certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits.\nAt the date of enactment, the Companies' deferred taxes were remeasured based upon the new tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are realized or settled. For regulated operations, many of the changes in deferred taxes represented amounts probable of collection from or refund to customers, and were recorded as either an increase to a regulatory asset or liability. The 2017 Tax Reform Act included provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes may be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. Potential refunds of other deferred taxes will be determined by the Companies' regulators. For nonregulated operations, the changes in deferred taxes were recorded as an adjustment to deferred tax expense.\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting for Derivative Contracts and Financial Instruments at Fair Value\nDominion Energy uses derivative contracts such as physical and financial forwards, futures, swaps, options and FTRs to manage commodity, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks of its business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The majority of investments held in Dominion Energy's nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trusts and pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 6 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements.\nFair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, Dominion Energy considers whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if Dominion Energy believes that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, Dominion Energy must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect its market assumptions.\nDominion Energy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nUse of Estimates in Goodwill Impairment Testing\nAs of December 31, 2019, Dominion Energy reported $8.9 billion of goodwill in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The majority of the balance relates to the SCANA Combination, as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Dominion Energy Questar Combination in 2016 and the acquisition of the former CNG in 2000.\nIn April of each year, Dominion Energy tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2019, Dominion Energy performed impairment tests immediately before and after the realignment of its operating segments. The 2019, 2018 and 2017 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.\nIn general, Dominion Energy estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion Energy's estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates\nare made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion Energy's estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion Energy has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present.\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUse of Estimates in Long-lived Asset and Equity Method Investment Impairment Testing\nImpairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with definite lives, and equity method investments is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When a long-lived asset's carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. When an equity method investment's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets and equity method investments involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets in the case of long-lived assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of a market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about the operations of the long-lived assets and equity method investments and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether a long-lived asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset or underlying assets of equity method investees, including future production and sales levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions. See Notes 6 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and equity method investments.\nAs discussed in Future Issues and Other Matters\n, continued delays in obtaining and maintaining permits necessary for construction along with construction delays due to judicial actions have impacted the estimated cost and schedule for the Atlantic\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 49\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nCoast Pipeline Project. As a result, Dominion Energy evaluated the carrying amount of its equity method investment in Atlantic Coast Pipeline for an other-than-temporary impairment and determined that it was not impaired. Any significant changes affecting the discounted cash flow estimates associated with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project, such as future unfavorable judicial or regulatory actions resulting in further construction and in-service\ndelays along with an increase in construction costs, could result in an impairment charge.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nDominion Energy sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations, mortality rates and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion Energy's assumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately.\nThe expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. Dominion Energy determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Historical return analysis to determine long-term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Expected future risk premiums, asset classes' volatilities and correlations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the expected long-term returns of major capital market assumptions; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion Energy's pension funds is 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S.\nequity, 35% fixed income, 3% real estate and 16% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStrategic investment policies are established for Dominion Energy's prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans' strategic allocation are a function of Dominion Energy's assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans' actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the targets. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns.\nDominion Energy develops non-investment\nrelated assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of an independent investment advisor to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion Energy calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption that ranged from 7.00% to 8.65% for 2019 and 8.75% for 2018 and 2017. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return for the pension cost assumption ranged from 7.00% to 8.60% for Dominion Energy's plans held as of December 31, 2019. Dominion Energy calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2019, 2018 and 2017. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return for other postretirement benefit cost assumption is 8.50%. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets.\nDominion Energy determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost ranged from 3.57% to 4.43% for pension plans and 4.05% to 4.41% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2019, ranged from 3.80% to 3.81% for pension plans and 3.76% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2018 and ranged from 3.31% to 4.50% for pension plans and 3.92% to 4.47% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2017. Dominion Energy selected a discount rate ranging from 3.47% to 3.63% for pension plans and 3.44% to 3.52% for other postretirement benefit plans for determining its December 31, 2019 projected benefit obligations.\nDominion Energy establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected and demographics of plan participants. Dominion Energy's healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2019 ranged from 6.50% to 6.60% and is expected to gradually decrease to 5.00% by 2025 and continue at that rate for years thereafter.\nThe following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed for Dominion Energy's plans held as of December 31, 2019, while holding all other assumptions constant:\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Increase in 2020 Net Periodic Cost\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\nActuarial\nAssumptions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Pension\nBenefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Other\nPostretirement\nBenefits\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Health care cost trend rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2019, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominion Energy's projected pension benefit obligation by $371 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $52 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $153 million.\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Dominion Energy's employee benefit plans.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.\nDominion Energy\nResults Of Operations\nPresented below is a summary of Dominion Energy's consolidated results:\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (millions, except\nEPS)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income attributable to Dominion Energy\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> $(1,089)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $(552)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2,999\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted EPS\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.74\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.98\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.72\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\n2019 vs. 2018\nNet Income attributable to Dominion Energy decreased 45%, primarily due to charges for refunds of amounts previously collected from retail electric customers of DESC for the NND Project, litigation acquired in the SCANA Combination, a voluntary retirement program, the planned early retirement of certain Virginia Power electric generation facilities and the absence of gains on the sales of certain equity method investments. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net investment earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the operations acquired in the SCANA Combination.\n2018 vs. 2017\nNet income attributable to Dominion Energy decreased 18%, primarily due to the absence of benefits in 2017 resulting from the remeasurement of deferred income taxes to the new corporate income tax rate, an impairment charge on certain gathering and processing assets, a charge associated with Virginia legislation enacted in March 2018, decreased net investment earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds, lower renewable energy investment tax credits and a charge for disallowance of FERC-regulated plant. These decreases were partially offset by gains on the sales of certain merchant generation facilities and equity method investments, the commencement of commercial operations of the Liquefaction Facility and the absence of charges associated with equity method investments in wind-powered generation facilities.\nAnalysis of Consolidated Operations\nPresented below are selected amounts related

These decreases were partially offset by increases related to higher rate adjustment clause equity returns, the revision of future ash pond and landfill closure costs as a result of Virginia legislation enacted in March 2019 and the absence of charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in March 2018 and April 2018.\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

See additional discussion below under Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt.\nA summary of Dominion Energy's cash flows is presented below:\nTable 338: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, restricted cash and equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 185\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 322\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,773\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,502\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,622\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,358\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5,942\n</td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> (704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,209\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,303\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash, restricted cash and equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> (122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 206\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (137\n</td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, restricted cash and equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 391\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 185\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by Dominion Energy's operating activities increased $431 million, primarily due to operations acquired in the SCANA Combination, the commercial operations of the Liquefaction Facility for the entire year and higher deferred fuel cost recoveries in the Virginia jurisdiction, partially offset by an increase in property tax payments, increased interest expense, higher customer rate refunds, a contract termination payment to a non-utility\ngenerator, an increase in merger and integration-related costs associated with the SCANA Combination, and a net decrease in other working capital items.\nDominion Energy believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In December 2019, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors established an annual dividend rate for 2020 of $3.76 per share of common stock, a 2.5% increase over the 2019 rate. Dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. In January 2020, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors declared dividends payable in March 2020 of 94 cents per share of common stock.\nDominion Energy's operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows, and which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCredit Risk\nDominion Energy's exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities. Presented below is a summary of Dominion Energy's credit exposure as of December 31, 2019 for these activities. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on-\nor off-balance\nsheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights.\nTable 339: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Gross\nCredit\nExposure\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Credit\nCollateral\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net\nCredit\nExposure\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment grade(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> $87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> $-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> $87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> No external ratings:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internally rated-investment grade(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internally rated-non-investment\ngrade(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> $233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> $-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> $233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's.

As discussed in Credit Ratings\n, Dominion Energy's ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.\nDominion Energy currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion Energy to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.\nFrom time to time, Dominion Energy may reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior to maturity and repurchases in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise.\nNet cash used in Dominion Energy's financing activities decreased $1.5 billion, primarily due to proceeds from the sale of a 25% noncontrolling limited partnership interest in Cove Point and the issuance of the 2019 Equity Units and the Series B Preferred Stock, partially offset by an increase in net debt repayments in 2019 compared to 2018 and higher common stock dividend payments.\nCredit Facilities and Short-Term Debt\nDominion Energy uses short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the\nTable 344: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nyear, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion Energy utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion Energy's credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties.\nIn connection with commodity hedging activities, Dominion Energy is required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, Dominion Energy may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, Dominion Energy may vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which Dominion Energy can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives.\nDominion Energy's commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under its credit facility, were as follows:\nTable 345: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Facility\nLimit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Outstanding\nCommercial\nPaper(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Outstanding\nLetters of\nCredit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Facility\nCapacity\nAvailable\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> At December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Joint revolving credit facility(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> $836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> $89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>The weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding commercial paper supported by Dominion Energy's credit facility was 2.10% at December 31, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table> <tr> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>This credit facility matures in March 2023 and can be used by the borrowers under the credit facility to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to a combined $2.0 billion of letters of credit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn November 2017, Dominion Energy filed an SEC shelf registration statement for the sale of up to $3.0 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called Dominion Energy Reliability InvestmentSM\n. The registration limits the principal amount that may be outstanding at any one time to $1.0 billion. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Dominion Energy Reliability Investment Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable\nand may be redeemed in whole or in part by Dominion Energy or at the investor's option at any time. The balance as of December 31, 2019 was $75 million. The notes are short-term debt obligations on Dominion Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to repay debt.\nIn March 2019, DESC's $700 million credit facility was terminated and DESC was added as a borrower to the joint revolving credit facility discussed above with Dominion Energy, Virginia Power, Dominion Energy Gas and Questar Gas. At December 31, 2019, the sub-limit\nfor DESC was $500 million.\nSouth Carolina Fuel Company, Inc.'s credit facility was terminated in February 2019. SCANA and PSNC's credit facilities\nwere terminated in March 2019. Liquidity needs for these entities may be satisfied through short-term company borrowings from Dominion Energy.\nIn February 2019, Dominion Energy Midstream terminated its $500 million revolving credit facility subsequent to repaying the outstanding balance of $73 million, plus accrued interest.\nIn September 2019, Dominion Energy Questar borrowed $3.0 billion under a 364-Day\nTerm Loan Agreement that bore interest at a variable rate. The proceeds from the borrowing were used to repay the principal of Cove Point's $3.0 billion term loan due in 2021. Dominion Energy provided a guarantee to support Dominion Energy Questar's obligation under the 364-Day\nTerm Loan Agreement. In November and December 2019, principal of $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, plus accrued interest was repaid.\nLong-Term Debt\nDuring 2019, Dominion Energy issued the following long-term public debt:\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Type\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Issuer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Principal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Maturity\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dominion Energy\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.250\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2028\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dominion Energy\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.600\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Virginia Power\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.875\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Virginia Power\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.300\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dominion Energy Gas\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.500\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dominion Energy Gas\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.000\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dominion Energy Gas\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.900\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total notes issued\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2019, Dominion Energy also issued the following long-term private debt:\nTable 349: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>In August 2019, Dominion Energy issued $1.0 billion of 2.45% senior notes that mature in 2023 through a private placement.

The Corporate Units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol DCUE.\nIn December 2019, Dominion Energy issued 800,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and received proceeds of $791 million.\nRepurchase of Common Stock\nDominion Energy did not repurchase any shares in 2019 and does not plan to repurchase shares during 2020, except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which does not count against its stock repurchase authorization.\nCredit Ratings\nCredit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion Energy believes that its current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion Energy may affect its ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominion Energy's credit ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities.\nBoth quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company's credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion Energy are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions.\nCredit ratings and outlooks as of February 25, 2020 follow:\nTable 363: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Fitch\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Moody's\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Standard & Poor's\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dominion Energy\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Issuer\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baa2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior unsecured debt securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baa2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Junior subordinated notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Enhanced junior subordinated notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preferred Stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ba1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial paper\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> P-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outlook\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA downgrade in an individual company's credit rating does not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it could result in an increase in the cost of borrowing. Dominion Energy works closely with Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's with the objective of achieving its targeted credit ratings. Dominion Energy may find it necessary to modify its\nbusiness plan to maintain or achieve appropriate credit ratings and such changes may adversely affect growth and EPS.\nDebt Covenants\nAs part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion Energy must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion Energy.\nSome of the typical covenants include:\nTable 364: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>The timely payment of principal and interest; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 365: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Information requirements, including submitting financial reports and information about changes in Dominion Energy's credit ratings to lenders; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 366: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 367: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 368: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Limitations on liens. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDominion Energy is required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain its credit facility. In addition, Dominion Energy's credit agreement contains various terms and conditions that could affect its ability to borrow under the facility. They include a maximum debt to total capital ratio and cross-default provisions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was as follows:\nTable 369: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Maximum Allowed Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Actual Ratio(1)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dominion Energy\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 370: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes certain junior subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf Dominion Energy or any of its material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require the defaulting company, if it is a borrower under Dominion Energy's credit facility, to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings and the lenders could terminate their commitments, if any, to lend funds to that company under the credit facility. In addition, if the defaulting company is Virginia Power, Dominion Energy's obligations to repay any outstanding borrowing under the credit facility could also be accelerated and the lenders' commitments to Dominion Energy could terminate.\nDominion Energy executed RCCs in connection with its issuance of the June 2006 hybrids and September 2006 hybrids. In February 2020, the RCCs were terminated subsequent to the redemption of the remaining principal outstanding of the June 2006 hybrids and the September 2006 hybrids. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTable 371: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 63\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nDominion Energy monitors these debt covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of December 31, 2019, there have been no events of default under Dominion Energy's debt covenants.\nDividend Restrictions\nCertain agreements associated with Dominion Energy's credit facility contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominion Energy's ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from its subsidiaries at December 31, 2019.\nSee Notes 19 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by Dominion Energy, including in connection with the deferral of contract adjustment payments associated with the 2019 Equity Units, which information is incorporated herein by reference, as well as the failure to declare and pay dividends on Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock.\nFuture Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures\nContractual Obligations\nDominion Energy is party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating it to make cash payments in future years. These contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases, as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services and financial derivatives. Presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts to which Dominion Energy is a party as of December 31, 2019. For purchase obligations and other liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. Actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt, interest payable and certain derivative instruments. The majority of Dominion Energy's current liabilities will be paid in cash in 2020.\nTable 372: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Dominion Energy's planned expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation, including renewable energy, and natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel, maintenance, and contributions to Atlantic Coast Pipeline to fund Dominion Energy's portion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project.\nDominion Energy expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the Board of Directors.\nSee Dominion Energy Virginia, Gas Transmission & Storage, Gas Distribution, Dominion Energy South Carolina\nand Contracted Generation -Properties\nin Item 1. Business for a discussion of Dominion Energy's expansion plans.\nTable 379: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above estimates are based on a capital expenditures plan reviewed and endorsed by Dominion Energy's Board of Directors in late 2019 and are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. Dominion Energy may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances.\nUse of Off-Balance\nSheet Arrangements\nLeasing Arrangement\nIn December 2019, Dominion Energy signed an agreement with a lessor to construct and lease a new corporate office property in Richmond, Virginia. The lessor is providing equity and has obtained financing commitments from debt investors, totaling $465 million, to fund the estimated project costs. If Dominion Energy ultimately proceeds with the project through completion, it is not expected to be completed earlier than mid-2023. Dominion Energy has been appointed to act as the construction agent for the lessor, during which time Dominion Energy will request cash draws from the lessor and debt investors to fund all project costs. If the project is terminated under certain events of default, Dominion Energy could be required to pay up to 89.9% of the then funded amount. For specific full recourse events, Dominion Energy could be required to pay up to 100% of the then funded amount.\nThe 51-month\nlease term will commence once construction is substantially complete and the facility is able to be occupied. At the end of the initial lease term, Dominion Energy can (i) extend the term of the lease for an additional five years, subject to the approval of the participants, at current market terms, (ii) purchase the property for an amount equal to the project costs or, (iii) subject to certain terms and conditions, sell the property on behalf of the lessor to a third party using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the highest cash purchase price for the property. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors for the project costs, Dominion Energy may be required to make a payment to the lessor, up to 83% of project costs, for the difference between the project costs and sale proceeds.\nDominion Energy is not considered the owner during construction for financial accounting purposes and, therefore, will not reflect the construction activity in its consolidated financial statements. Dominion Energy expects to recognize a right-of-use\nasset and a corresponding finance lease liability at the commencement of the lease term. Dominion Energy will be considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes, and as a result, will be entitled to tax deductions for depreciation and interest expense.\nGuarantees\nDominion Energy primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not subject to the provisions of FASB guidance that dictate a guarantor's accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others.\nIn addition, Dominion Energy has provided a guarantee to support a portion of Atlantic Coast Pipeline's obligation under a $3.4 billion revolving credit facility. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFuture Issues And Other Matters\nSee Item 1. Business and Notes 13 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nEnvironmental Matters\nDominion Energy is subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.\nEnvironmental Protection and Monitoring Expenditures\nDominion Energy incurred $260 million, $198 million and $200 million of expenses (including accretion and depreciation) during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities. Dominion Energy expects these expenses to be approximately $286 million and $275 million in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $134 million, $104 million, and $201 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Dominion Energy expects these expenditures to be approximately $159 million and $132 million for 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nFuture Environmental Regulations\nClimate Change\nIn December 2015, the Paris Agreement was formally adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. A key element of the initial U.S. commitment to the agreement was the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, which the EPA has proposed to repeal. In June 2017, the Administration announced that the U.S. intends to file to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2019. Several states, including Virginia, subsequently announced a commitment to achieving the carbon reduction goals of the Paris Agreement. It is not possible at this time to predict the timing and impact of this withdrawal, or how any legal requirements in the U.S. at the federal, state or local levels pursuant to the Paris Agreement could impact the Companies' customers or the business.\nState Actions Related to Air and GHG Emissions\nIn August 2017, the Ozone Transport Commission released a draft model rule for control of NOX\nemissions from natural gas pipeline compressor fuel-fire prime movers. States within the ozone transport region, including states in which Dominion Energy has natural gas operations, are expected to develop reasonably achievable control technology rules for existing sources based on the Ozone Transport Commission model rule. States outside of the Ozone Transport Commission may also consider the model rules in setting new reasonably achievable control technology standards. Several states in which Dominion Energy operates, including Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, Virginia and Ohio, are developing or have announced plans to develop state-specific regulations to control GHG emissions, including methane.\nTable 380: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 65\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nDominion Energy cannot currently estimate the potential financial statement impacts related to these matters, but there could be a material impact to its financial condition and/or cash flows.\nWater\nIn November 2019, the EPA released proposed revisions to the Effluent Limitations Guidelines rule that, if adopted, could extend the deadlines for compliance with certain standards at several facilities. While the impacts of this rule could be material to Dominion Energy's results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory frameworks in South Carolina and Virginia provide rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts for the regulated electric utilities.\nPHMSA Regulation\nThe most recent reauthorization of PHMSA included new provisions on historical records research, maximum-allowed operating pressure validation, use of automated or remote-controlled valves on new or replaced lines, increased civil penalties and evaluation of expanding integrity management beyond high-consequence areas. PHMSA has not yet issued new rulemaking on most of these items.\nDodd-Frank Act\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The CEA, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the\ncounter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial\nentities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user\nexception to the CEA's clearing requirements. Dominion Energy has elected to exempt its swaps from the CEA's clearing requirements. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process, Dominion Energy's derivative activities are not exempted from clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, it could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, Dominion Energy's swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with changes to or the elimination of rulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Due to the evolving rulemaking process, Dominion Energy is currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act's derivative-related provisions on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nVirginia Legislation\nThe 2020 General Assembly session in Virginia has included several proposals which, if ultimately enacted into law, could have a material impact on Dominion Energy's operations, as well as impacts on regulatory cost recovery. Items under consideration include environmental requirements such as joining RGGI or meeting mandatory renewable portfolio standards that could result in both the need to develop new renewable electric generation facilities and the closure of certain existing electric generation facilities, expanded use of distributed renewable generation resources and additional requirements related to\ndemand side management programs. Additionally, legislation has been proposed which may affect Dominion Energy's plans and/or cost recovery mechanisms for offshore wind development and replacing diesel school buses with electric school buses. Due to the evolving legislative process, Dominion Energy is unable to estimate the potential financial statement impacts related to matters currently under consideration by the Virginia General Assembly, but there could be a material impact to its results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nAtlantic Coast Pipeline\nIn September 2014, Dominion Energy, along with Duke and Southern, announced the formation of Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is focused on constructing an approximately 600-mile\nnatural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina. Atlantic Coast Pipeline has continued to experience delays in obtaining and/or maintaining permits necessary for construction along with construction delays due to judicial actions. In February 2020, the Supreme Court of the U.S. heard oral arguments in Atlantic Coast Pipeline's case regarding the Appalachian Trail crossing and is expected to issue a ruling by June 2020. If a favorable ruling is not received, Atlantic Coast Pipeline is also evaluating possible legislative and administrative remedies to this issue. Given the legal challenges and ongoing discussions with customers, project construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2021, with full in-service\nin early 2022, with project costs estimated to be approximately $8 billion, excluding financing costs. Atlantic Coast Pipeline has reached agreements in principle with major customers to amend the contracted rate to share in certain delay cost increases, pending certain regulatory approvals. Project construction activities, schedules and costs are subject to uncertainty due to permitting and/or work delays (including due to judicial or regulatory action), abnormal weather and other conditions that could result in cost or schedule modifications in the future, a suspension of AFUDC for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and/or impairment charges potentially material to Dominion Energy's cash flows, financial position and/or results of operations.

Dominion Energy Gas' results of operations follows:\nDominion Energy sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations, mortality rates and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion Energy's assumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n\nSheet Arrangements\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (millions, except\nEPS)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income attributable to Dominion Energy\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> $(1,089)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $(552)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2,999\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted EPS\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.74\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.98\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.72\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation and judicial actions; \nAccounting for Derivative Contracts and Financial Instruments at Fair Value\n \u2022 A $45 million increase in operating expenses from the commercial operations of the Liquefaction Facility and costs associated with regulated gas transportation contracts to serve the Export Customers; \nPresented below are the Corporate and Other segment's after-tax\nDecember 2019, Dominion Energy completed the program.

In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2019, Dominion Energy performed impairment tests immediately before and after the realignment of its operating segments. The 2019, 2018 and 2017 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.\nStrategic investment policies are established for Dominion Energy's prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans' strategic allocation are a function of Dominion Energy's assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans' actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the targets. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns.\nThe Companies' forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are made. The Companies caution the reader not to place undue reliance on their forward-looking statements because the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and projections about future events may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. The Companies undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\nIn November 2017, Dominion Energy filed an SEC shelf registration statement for the sale of up to $3.0 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called Dominion Energy Reliability InvestmentSM\nDominion Energy uses derivative contracts such as physical and financial forwards, futures, swaps, options and FTRs to manage commodity, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks of its business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The majority of investments held in Dominion Energy's nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trusts and pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 6 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements.\nDebt Covenants\n \u2022 Fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates; \nTerm Loan Agreement.

Risk Factors.\ndecreased 98%, primarily due to the absence of gains related to agreements to convey shale development rights under natural gas storage fields.\nFair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, Dominion Energy considers whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if Dominion Energy believes that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, Dominion Energy must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect its market assumptions.\n \u2022 Additional competition in industries in which the Companies operate, including in electric markets in which Dominion Energy's merchant generation facilities operate and potential competition from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources, such as self-generation and distributed generation technologies, and availability of market alternatives to large commercial and industrial customers; \nImpairment of assets and related charges\nContractual Obligations\nThe 2020 General Assembly session in Virginia has included several proposals which, if ultimately enacted into law, could have a material impact on Dominion Energy's operations, as well as impacts on regulatory cost recovery.

PHMSA has not yet issued new rulemaking on most of these items.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Dominion Energy reported $8.9 billion of goodwill in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The majority of the balance relates to the SCANA Combination, as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Dominion Energy Questar Combination in 2016 and the acquisition of the former CNG in 2000.\n \u2022 A $10 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits and general administrative expenses; substantially offset by \nDominion Energy's 2020 net income is expected to increase on a per share basis as compared to 2019 primarily from the following:\n \u2022 Limitations on liens. \n \u2022 Past experience; \nGains on sales of assets\nImpairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with definite lives, and equity method investments is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When a long-lived asset's carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. When an equity method investment's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets and equity method investments involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets in the case of long-lived assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of a market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about the operations of the long-lived assets and equity method investments and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether a long-lived asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset or underlying assets of equity method investees, including future production and sales levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions. See Notes 6 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and equity method investments.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nInterest and related charges\ncomponents of pension and other postretirement employee benefit credits capitalized to property, plant and equipment in 2018 ($45 million), partially offset by a decrease in net investment earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($209 million).\n\n \u2022 Risks associated with Virginia Power's membership and participation in PJM, including risks related to obligations created by the default of other participants; \n \u2022 Fluctuations in future volumes of LNG imports or exports from the U.S. and other countries worldwide or demand for, purchases of, and prices related to natural gas or LNG; \nDominion Energy Virginia\nincreased 14%, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 A $74 million decrease from a reduction in planned outage days at certain merchant and utility generation facilities. \nincreased 24%, primarily due to the absence of capitalization of interest expense associated with the Liquefaction Facility upon completion of construction ($111 million), higher long-term debt interest expense resulting from net debt issuances in 2018 and 2017 ($92 million) and charges associated with the early redemption of certain debt securities ($69 million).\nDepreciation and amortization\nand employee savings plans.\n \u2022 Construction and operation of growth projects in electric utility operations; \nThe Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets.

Due to uncertainty about the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, $118 million of income taxes payable associated with unrecognized tax benefits are excluded. Deferred income taxes are also excluded since cash payments are based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year.

In June 2019, the first mortgage lien on an electric generating facility that previously secured these notes was released. \nIn December 2015, the Paris Agreement was formally adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. A key element of the initial U.S. commitment to the agreement was the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, which the EPA has proposed to repeal. In June 2017, the Administration announced that the U.S. intends to file to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2019. Several states, including Virginia, subsequently announced a commitment to achieving the carbon reduction goals of the Paris Agreement. It is not possible at this time to predict the timing and impact of this withdrawal, or how any legal requirements in the U.S. at the federal, state or local levels pursuant to the Paris Agreement could impact the Companies' customers or the business.\n \u2022 Changes in technology, particularly with respect to new, developing or alternative sources of generation and smart grid technologies; \nDominion Energy's planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $8.2 billion, $8.1 billion, and $7.6 billion in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. Dominion Energy's planned expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation, including renewable energy, and natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel, maintenance, and contributions to Atlantic Coast Pipeline to fund Dominion Energy's portion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project.\nDuring 2019, Dominion Energy repaid, repurchased or redeemed $9.1 billion of long-term debt, including redemption premiums.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n \u2022 In June 2019, Dominion Energy purchased and canceled $12 million and $13 million of its June 2006 hybrids and September 2006 hybrids, respectively.

As discussed in Credit Ratings\nIf recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. A regulatory liability, if considered probable, will be recorded in the period such assessment is made or reversed into earnings if no longer probable. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nrelated assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of an independent investment advisor to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion Energy calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption that ranged from 7.00% to 8.65% for 2019 and 8.75% for 2018 and 2017. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return for the pension cost assumption ranged from 7.00% to 8.60% for Dominion Energy's plans held as of December 31, 2019. Dominion Energy calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2019, 2018 and 2017. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return for other postretirement benefit cost assumption is 8.50%. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets.\nincreased $189 million, primarily due to the absence of benefits resulting from the remeasurement of deferred income taxes to the new corporate income tax rate ($246 million), higher pre-tax\nabsence of quoted market prices, Dominion Energy estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation or credit-adjusted risk free rates in the future, may be significant. When Dominion Energy revises any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset for assets that are in service; for assets that have ceased operations, Dominion Energy adjusts the carrying amount of the ARO liability with such changes recognized in income.\n (2) Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt and payments on stock purchase contracts. Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate or forward interest rate curve at December 31, 2019 and outstanding principal for each instrument with the terms ending at each instrument's stated maturity.

Dominion Energy expects these expenses to be approximately $286 million and $275 million in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $134 million, $104 million, and $201 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Dominion Energy expects these expenditures to be approximately $159 million and $132 million for 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n\nincreased 79%, primarily due to Cove Point's term loan borrowings ($78 million), the absence of capitalization of interest expense associated with the Liquefaction Facility upon completion of construction ($46 million) and higher interest expense due to increased affiliate borrowings ($10 million).\n \u2022 A $46 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers due to customer growth. \n\n \u2022 In February and March 2019, DESC purchased certain of its first mortgage bonds having an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion pursuant to tender offers.

Dominion Energy has elected to exempt its swaps from the CEA's clearing requirements. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process, Dominion Energy's derivative activities are not exempted from clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, it could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, Dominion Energy's swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with changes to or the elimination of rulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Due to the evolving rulemaking process, Dominion Energy is currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act's derivative-related provisions on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n \u2022 Results of Operations \nIn January 2020, SCANA provided notice to redeem its floating rate senior notes at the remaining principal outstanding of $66 million plus accrued interest in March 2020.

These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.\nAs part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion Energy must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion Energy.\nPresented below are selected amounts related to Dominion Energy Gas' results of operations:\nincreased 44%, primarily due to interest income from Cove Point's promissory notes receivable from Dominion Energy issued in September 2018 ($20 million) and a decrease in non-service\ncomponents of pension and other postretirement employee benefit credits capitalized to property, plant and equipment in 2018 ($13 million), partially offset by AFUDC on rate-regulated projects ($7 million).\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 A decrease in charges associated with litigation acquired in the SCANA Combination; \nDominion Energy primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries.

If Virginia Power decides to build a new unit, it would require a Combined Construction Permit and Operating License from the NRC, approval of the Virginia Commission and certain environmental permits and other approvals. In June 2017, the NRC issued the Combined Construction Permit and Operating License. Virginia Power has not yet committed to building a new nuclear unit at North Anna.\nDominion Energy's AROs include a significant balance related to the future decommissioning of its merchant and utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and Contracted Generation. At December 31, 2019, Dominion Energy's nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $1.7 billion. The following discusses critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs associated with Dominion Energy's nuclear decommissioning obligations.\nNet income attributable to Dominion Energy Gas decreased 32%, primarily due to an impairment charge on certain gathering and processing assets included in discontinued operations, a charge for disallowance of FERC-regulated plant and the absence of benefits from the 2017 Tax Reform Act, partially offset by the commencement of commercial operations of the Liquefaction Facility, regulated natural gas transmission activities from growth projects placed into service and an increase in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields.\n \u2022 Lower depreciation on Virginia Power's nuclear plants associated with expected approval of license extensions from the NRC; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nCredit ratings and outlooks as of February 25, 2020 follow:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nAtlantic Coast Pipeline\n \u2022 The absence of a benefit for the revision of future ash pond and landfill closure costs as a result of Virginia legislation enacted in March 2019; \nfor DESC was $500 million.\n \u2022 A $99 million decrease in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline; and \nPresented below is a summary of Virginia Power's consolidated results:\nNoncontrolling interests\nincreased 42%, primarily reflecting:\nFuture Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures\nFuture Issues And Other Matters\n \u2022 A $130 million increase due to favorable pricing at merchant generation facilities; \nCredit Risk\nOther operations and maintenance\n (3) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 11% of the total net credit exposure. \n\nDominion Energy uses short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings.

For regulated operations, many of the changes in deferred taxes represented amounts probable of collection from or refund to customers, and were recorded as either an increase to a regulatory asset or liability. The 2017 Tax Reform Act included provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes may be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. Potential refunds of other deferred taxes will be determined by the Companies' regulators. For nonregulated operations, the changes in deferred taxes were recorded as an adjustment to deferred tax expense.\nincreased $757 million, primarily reflecting:\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nincreased 2%, primarily reflecting:\n\n \u2022 The noncontrolling 25% limited partnership interest in Cove Point sold in December 2019; \nCoast Pipeline Project.

In addition, Dominion Energy utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion Energy's credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties.\nA downgrade in an individual company's credit rating does not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it could result in an increase in the cost of borrowing. Dominion Energy works closely with Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's with the objective of achieving its targeted credit ratings.

The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion Energy to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.\nNet income decreased 17%, primarily due to a charge associated with Virginia legislation enacted in March 2018, an increase in storm damage and service restoration costs, a charge associated primarily with future ash pond and landfill closure costs in connection with the enactment of Virginia legislation in April 2018 and an increase in net electric capacity expense, partially offset by an increase in heating and cooling degree days in the service territory.\n \u2022 A $19 million decrease from a reduction in planned outage days at certain generation facilities. \nNet cash provided by Dominion Energy's operating activities increased $431 million, primarily due to operations acquired in the SCANA Combination, the commercial operations of the Liquefaction Facility for the entire year and higher deferred fuel cost recoveries in the Virginia jurisdiction, partially offset by an increase in property tax payments, increased interest expense, higher customer rate refunds, a contract termination payment to a non-utility\n \u2022 A $62 million charge related to the abandonment of a project at a Virginia Power electric generating facility; and \nThe 2017 Tax Reform Act included a broad range of tax reform provisions affecting the Companies, including changes in corporate tax rates and business deductions. Many of these provisions differ significantly from prior U.S. tax law, resulting in pervasive financial reporting implications for the Companies. The 2017 Tax Reform Act included significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including amendments which significantly change the taxation of individuals and business entities and included specific provisions related to regulated public utilities. The more significant changes that impact the Companies included in the 2017 Tax Reform Act are (i) reducing the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) effective in 2018, limiting the deductibility of interest expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income for certain businesses with any disallowed interest allowed to be carried forward indefinitely; (iii) permitting 100% expensing (100% bonus depreciation) for certain qualified property; (iv) eliminating the deduction for qualified domestic production activities; and (v) limiting the utilization of net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward. The specific provisions related to regulated public utilities in the 2017 Tax Reform Act generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, the exclusion from full expensing for tax purposes of certain property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and continued certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits.\nCertain agreements associated with Dominion Energy's credit facility contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominion Energy's ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from its subsidiaries at December 31, 2019.\n\nGains on sales of assets\n \u2022 A $348 million increase from rate adjustment clauses; \nDominion Energy is required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain its credit facility. In addition, Dominion Energy's credit agreement contains various terms and conditions that could affect its ability to borrow under the facility. They include a maximum debt to total capital ratio and cross-default provisions.\n \u2022 An $89 million decrease from rate adjustment clauses, which includes the impacts of the 2017 Tax Reform Act; partially offset by \n\nAccounting Matters\n, continued delays in obtaining and maintaining permits necessary for construction along with construction delays due to judicial actions have impacted the estimated cost and schedule for the Atlantic\n\n \u2022 A $46 million increase in sales to retail customers due to customer growth. \ndecreased 31%, primarily due to the acquisition of the public interest in Dominion Energy Midstream in January 2019.\nLiquidity And Capital Resources\nDominion Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred or when sufficient information becomes available to determine fair value and are generally capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the\nOther taxes\n, Dominion Energy's ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.\nInterest and related charges\n2018 VS. 2017\nincreased 25%, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory developments, including changes in federal and state tax laws and regulations; \n \u2022 Unusual weather conditions and their effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices; \nNoncontrolling interests\nPresented below are selected operating statistics related to Contracted Generation's operations:\nIf Dominion Energy or any of its material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require the defaulting company, if it is a borrower under Dominion Energy's credit facility, to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings and the lenders could terminate their commitments, if any, to lend funds to that company under the credit facility. In addition, if the defaulting company is Virginia Power, Dominion Energy's obligations to repay any outstanding borrowing under the credit facility could also be accelerated and the lenders' commitments to Dominion Energy could terminate.\nIncome tax expense\n \u2022 In May 2019, Virginia Power redeemed its $40 million 5.0% Economic Development Authority of the County of Chesterfield Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2009A, due in 2023 at the principal outstanding plus accrued interest. \nLeasing Arrangement\nOther income\nOutlook\n \u2022 Expected future risk premiums, asset classes' volatilities and correlations; \n\nbasis, are the key factors impacting Dominion Energy South Carolina's net income contribution:\nContracted Generation\nVirginia Power\n\nassets and liabilities.

Dominion Energy's healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2019 ranged from 6.50% to 6.60% and is expected to gradually decrease to 5.00% by 2025 and continue at that rate for years thereafter.\nAt December 31, 2019, Dominion Energy had $5.1 billion of unused capacity under its credit facility. See additional discussion below under Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt.\n2018 vs. 2017\nIn November 2019, the EPA released proposed revisions to the Effluent Limitations Guidelines rule that, if adopted, could extend the deadlines for compliance with certain standards at several facilities. While the impacts of this rule could be material to Dominion Energy's results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory frameworks in South Carolina and Virginia provide rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts for the regulated electric utilities.\n \u2022 Changes to regulated electric rates collected by Dominion Energy and Virginia Power and regulated gas distribution, transportation and storage rates, including LNG storage, collected by Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas; \nassociated with the Eastern Market Access Project ($37 million), partially offset by the absence of a charge to write-off\nThe expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net investment earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($720 million) and an increase in equity earnings from Atlantic Coast Pipeline ($50 million).\nNet income decreased 10%, primarily due to charges associated with the planned early retirement of certain electric generation facilities and automated meter reading infrastructure, a voluntary retirement program and a contract termination with a non-utility\nThe Companies make forward-looking statements with full knowledge that risks and uncertainties exist that may cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ are often presented with the forward-looking statements themselves. Additionally, other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement. These factors include but are not limited to:\n \u2022 The absence of an $81 million charge associated primarily with future ash pond and landfill closure costs in connection with the enactment of Virginia legislation in April 2018; and \n \u2022 A $238 million decrease for regulated generation and distribution operations as a result of the 2017 Tax Reform Act; \nCredit Facilities and Short-Term Debt\nDominion Energy has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion Energy has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.\n \u2022 A $74 million decrease in electric capacity expense primarily related to the annual PJM capacity performance market effective June 2019 ($63 million) and a contract termination with a non-utility generator ($37 million), partially offset by the annual PJM capacity performance market effective June 2018 ($26 million); and \n \u2022 Changes in future levels of domestic and international natural gas production, supply or consumption; \nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion Energy evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. Dominion Energy establishes a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not\nNet Income attributable to Dominion Energy decreased 45%, primarily due to charges for refunds of amounts previously collected from retail electric customers of DESC for the NND Project, litigation acquired in the SCANA Combination, a voluntary retirement program, the planned early retirement of certain Virginia Power electric generation facilities and the absence of gains on the sales of certain equity method investments. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net investment earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the operations acquired in the SCANA Combination.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nUse of Estimates in Long-lived Asset and Equity Method Investment Impairment Testing\nincreased $114 million, primarily due to the absence of capitalization of interest expense associated with the Liquefaction Facility upon completion of construction ($72 million) and Cove Point's term loan borrowings ($36 million).\nIn January 2019, in connection with the SCANA Combination, Dominion Energy issued 95.6 million shares of Dominion Energy common stock, valued at $6.8 billion, representing 0.6690 of a share of Dominion Energy common stock for each share of SCANA common stock outstanding at closing.

Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on-\nincome ($256 million), the reduced corporate income tax rate ($235 million) and higher renewable energy investment tax credits ($35 million), partially offset by the absence of benefits resulting from the remeasurement of deferred income taxes to the new corporate income tax rate ($93 million).\nbasis, are the key factors impacting Gas Transmission & Storage's net income contribution:\nthe balance of a regulatory asset no longer considered probable of recovery ($15 million).\n \u2022 A $43 million decrease from the absence of certain merchant generation facilities sold in 2018. \n \u2022 Competition in the development, construction and ownership of certain electric transmission facilities in Dominion Energy and Virginia Power's service territory in connection with Order 1000; \ndecreased 20%, primarily due to lower earnings from Iroquois.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n2018 VS. 2017\n2019 VS. 2018\n \u2022 Risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are subject to changing regulatory structures; \n\nIn addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2019, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominion Energy's projected pension benefit obligation by $371 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $52 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $153 million.\n (4) Includes capital, operations and maintenance commitments. \nbasis, are the key factors impacting Contracted Generation's net income contribution:\n \u2022 Accounting Matters-Dominion Energy \n\n 59 \n \u2022 A $1.5 billion increase from the SCANA Combination, due to operations acquired ($2.5 billion), partially offset by a $1.0 billion charge for refunds of amounts previously collected from retail electric customers of DESC for the NND Project; \nrate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred.\nare made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion Energy's estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion Energy has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results.

In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2019, Dominion Energy performed impairment tests immediately before and after the realignment of its operating segments. The 2019, 2018 and 2017 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.\nStrategic investment policies are established for Dominion Energy's prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans' strategic allocation are a function of Dominion Energy's assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans' actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the targets. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns.\nThe Companies' forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are made. The Companies caution the reader not to place undue reliance on their forward-looking statements because the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and projections about future events may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. The Companies undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\nIn November 2017, Dominion Energy filed an SEC shelf registration statement for the sale of up to $3.0 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called Dominion Energy Reliability InvestmentSM\nDominion Energy uses derivative contracts such as physical and financial forwards, futures, swaps, options and FTRs to manage commodity, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks of its business operations.

In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, Dominion Energy considers whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if Dominion Energy believes that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, Dominion Energy must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect its market assumptions.\n \u2022 Additional competition in industries in which the Companies operate, including in electric markets in which Dominion Energy's merchant generation facilities operate and potential competition from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources, such as self-generation and distributed generation technologies, and availability of market alternatives to large commercial and industrial customers; \nImpairment of assets and related charges\nContractual Obligations\nThe 2020 General Assembly session in Virginia has included several proposals which, if ultimately enacted into law, could have a material impact on Dominion Energy's operations, as well as impacts on regulatory cost recovery.

When a long-lived asset's carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. When an equity method investment's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets and equity method investments involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets in the case of long-lived assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of a market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about the operations of the long-lived assets and equity method investments and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether a long-lived asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset or underlying assets of equity method investees, including future production and sales levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions.

A key element of the initial U.S. commitment to the agreement was the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, which the EPA has proposed to repeal. In June 2017, the Administration announced that the U.S. intends to file to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2019. Several states, including Virginia, subsequently announced a commitment to achieving the carbon reduction goals of the Paris Agreement. It is not possible at this time to predict the timing and impact of this withdrawal, or how any legal requirements in the U.S. at the federal, state or local levels pursuant to the Paris Agreement could impact the Companies' customers or the business.\n \u2022 Changes in technology, particularly with respect to new, developing or alternative sources of generation and smart grid technologies; \nDominion Energy's planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $8.2 billion, $8.1 billion, and $7.6 billion in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. Dominion Energy's planned expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation, including renewable energy, and natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel, maintenance, and contributions to Atlantic Coast Pipeline to fund Dominion Energy's portion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project.\nDuring 2019, Dominion Energy repaid, repurchased or redeemed $9.1 billion of long-term debt, including redemption premiums.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n \u2022 In June 2019, Dominion Energy purchased and canceled $12 million and $13 million of its June 2006 hybrids and September 2006 hybrids, respectively.

An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion Energy calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption that ranged from 7.00% to 8.65% for 2019 and 8.75% for 2018 and 2017. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return for the pension cost assumption ranged from 7.00% to 8.60% for Dominion Energy's plans held as of December 31, 2019. Dominion Energy calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2019, 2018 and 2017. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return for other postretirement benefit cost assumption is 8.50%. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets.\nincreased $189 million, primarily due to the absence of benefits resulting from the remeasurement of deferred income taxes to the new corporate income tax rate ($246 million), higher pre-tax\nabsence of quoted market prices, Dominion Energy estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation or credit-adjusted risk free rates in the future, may be significant. When Dominion Energy revises any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset for assets that are in service; for assets that have ceased operations, Dominion Energy adjusts the carrying amount of the ARO liability with such changes recognized in income.\n (2) Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt and payments on stock purchase contracts.

Dominion Energy expects these expenses to be approximately $286 million and $275 million in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $134 million, $104 million, and $201 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Dominion Energy expects these expenditures to be approximately $159 million and $132 million for 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n\nincreased 79%, primarily due to Cove Point's term loan borrowings ($78 million), the absence of capitalization of interest expense associated with the Liquefaction Facility upon completion of construction ($46 million) and higher interest expense due to increased affiliate borrowings ($10 million).\n \u2022 A $46 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers due to customer growth. \n\n \u2022 In February and March 2019, DESC purchased certain of its first mortgage bonds having an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion pursuant to tender offers.

Dominion Energy has elected to exempt its swaps from the CEA's clearing requirements. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process, Dominion Energy's derivative activities are not exempted from clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, it could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, Dominion Energy's swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with changes to or the elimination of rulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Due to the evolving rulemaking process, Dominion Energy is currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act's derivative-related provisions on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n \u2022 Results of Operations \nIn January 2020, SCANA provided notice to redeem its floating rate senior notes at the remaining principal outstanding of $66 million plus accrued interest in March 2020.

These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.\nAs part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion Energy must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion Energy.\nPresented below are selected amounts related to Dominion Energy Gas' results of operations:\nincreased 44%, primarily due to interest income from Cove Point's promissory notes receivable from Dominion Energy issued in September 2018 ($20 million) and a decrease in non-service\ncomponents of pension and other postretirement employee benefit credits capitalized to property, plant and equipment in 2018 ($13 million), partially offset by AFUDC on rate-regulated projects ($7 million).\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 A decrease in charges associated with litigation acquired in the SCANA Combination; \nDominion Energy primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries.

If Virginia Power decides to build a new unit, it would require a Combined Construction Permit and Operating License from the NRC, approval of the Virginia Commission and certain environmental permits and other approvals. In June 2017, the NRC issued the Combined Construction Permit and Operating License. Virginia Power has not yet committed to building a new nuclear unit at North Anna.\nDominion Energy's AROs include a significant balance related to the future decommissioning of its merchant and utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and Contracted Generation.

For purchase obligations and other liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. Actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt, interest payable and certain derivative instruments. The majority of Dominion Energy's current liabilities will be paid in cash in 2020.\nincreased 87%, primarily due to interest income from Cove Point's promissory notes receivable from Dominion Energy issued in 2018.\nand Contracted Generation -Properties\nCredit Ratings\nBoth quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company's credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion Energy are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions.\n\nGas Transmission & Storage\n \u2022 The inability to complete planned construction, conversion or growth projects at all, or with the outcomes or within the terms and time frames initially anticipated, including as a result of increased public involvement, intervention or litigation in such projects; \nAn analysis of Dominion Energy's results of operations follows:\nNet revenue\n \u2022 Cost of environmental compliance, including those costs related to climate change; \n \u2022 A $257 million increase from the Liquefaction Facility, including terminalling services provided to the Export Customers ($190 million), a decrease in credits associated with the start-up phase ($44 million) and regulated gas transportation contracts to serve the Export Customers ($23 million); and \n \u2022 A $42 million increase in net fuel carrying costs as a result of depressed natural gas market conditions. \nPresented below, on an after-tax\n \u2022 Virginia Power \n \u2022 A $99 million decrease in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline; and \nDominion Energy determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost ranged from 3.57% to 4.43% for pension plans and 4.05% to 4.41% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2019, ranged from 3.80% to 3.81% for pension plans and 3.76% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2018 and ranged from 3.31% to 4.50% for pension plans and 3.92% to 4.47% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2017. Dominion Energy selected a discount rate ranging from 3.47% to 3.63% for pension plans and 3.44% to 3.52% for other postretirement benefit plans for determining its December 31, 2019 projected benefit obligations.\n \u2022 A $73 million increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline. These expenses are billed to Atlantic Coast Pipeline and do not significantly impact net income; \nDuring 2019, Dominion Energy issued the following long-term public debt:\nTerm Loan Agreement that bore interest at a variable rate. The proceeds from the borrowing were used to repay the principal of Cove Point's $3.0 billion term loan due in 2021.

For regulated operations, many of the changes in deferred taxes represented amounts probable of collection from or refund to customers, and were recorded as either an increase to a regulatory asset or liability. The 2017 Tax Reform Act included provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes may be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. Potential refunds of other deferred taxes will be determined by the Companies' regulators. For nonregulated operations, the changes in deferred taxes were recorded as an adjustment to deferred tax expense.\nincreased $757 million, primarily reflecting:\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nincreased 2%, primarily reflecting:\n\n \u2022 The noncontrolling 25% limited partnership interest in Cove Point sold in December 2019; \nCoast Pipeline Project. As a result, Dominion Energy evaluated the carrying amount of its equity method investment in Atlantic Coast Pipeline for an other-than-temporary impairment and determined that it was not impaired.

In addition, Dominion Energy utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion Energy's credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties.\nA downgrade in an individual company's credit rating does not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it could result in an increase in the cost of borrowing. Dominion Energy works closely with Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's with the objective of achieving its targeted credit ratings. Dominion Energy may find it necessary to modify its\n (1) Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's.

At the end of the initial lease term, Dominion Energy can (i) extend the term of the lease for an additional five years, subject to the approval of the participants, at current market terms, (ii) purchase the property for an amount equal to the project costs or, (iii) subject to certain terms and conditions, sell the property on behalf of the lessor to a third party using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the highest cash purchase price for the property. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors for the project costs, Dominion Energy may be required to make a payment to the lessor, up to 83% of project costs, for the difference between the project costs and sale proceeds.\n \u2022 Impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, transfers of assets to joint ventures and retirements of assets based on asset portfolio reviews; \n \u2022 A $47 million increase in operating expenses from the commercial operations of the Liquefaction Facility and costs associated with regulated gas transportation contracts to serve the Export Customers; and \n \u2022 A reduction in merger and integration-related costs associated with the SCANA Combination, including charges related to a voluntary retirement program; \nor off-balance\nremained substantially consistent primarily reflecting:\n (1) The weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding commercial paper supported by Dominion Energy's credit facility was 2.10% at December 31, 2019. \nThe above estimates are based on a capital expenditures plan reviewed and endorsed by Dominion Energy's Board of Directors in late 2019 and are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. Dominion Energy may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances.\n \u2022 A $74 million increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline; and \ndecreased 19%, primarily due to the impacts of changes in tax status of certain subsidiaries in connection with the Dominion Energy Gas Restructuring ($48 million), partially offset by reductions in noncontrolling interest associated with Dominion Energy's purchase of Dominion Energy Midstream publicly held common units ($9 million) and the absence of a state legislative change ($15 million).\n (3) Amounts exclude open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, the timing of which cannot be determined. \ntransaction and transition costs associated with the Dominion Energy Questar Combination and SCANA Combination. In 2017, this primarily included $124 million of tax benefits resulting from the remeasurement of deferred income taxes to the new corporate income tax rate.\nincreased $610 million, primarily due to the absence of benefits resulting from the remeasurement of deferred income taxes to the new corporate income tax rate ($851 million) and lower renewable energy investment tax credits ($138 million), partially offset by the reduced corporate income tax rate ($414 million).\nDominion Energy currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion Energy to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.\nNet income decreased 17%, primarily due to a charge associated with Virginia legislation enacted in March 2018, an increase in storm damage and service restoration costs, a charge associated primarily with future ash pond and landfill closure costs in connection with the enactment of Virginia legislation in April 2018 and an increase in net electric capacity expense, partially offset by an increase in heating and cooling degree days in the service territory.\n \u2022 A $19 million decrease from a reduction in planned outage days at certain generation facilities. \nNet cash provided by Dominion Energy's operating activities increased $431 million, primarily due to operations acquired in the SCANA Combination, the commercial operations of the Liquefaction Facility for the entire year and higher deferred fuel cost recoveries in the Virginia jurisdiction, partially offset by an increase in property tax payments, increased interest expense, higher customer rate refunds, a contract termination payment to a non-utility\n \u2022 A $62 million charge related to the abandonment of a project at a Virginia Power electric generating facility; and \nThe 2017 Tax Reform Act included a broad range of tax reform provisions affecting the Companies, including changes in corporate tax rates and business deductions. Many of these provisions differ significantly from prior U.S. tax law, resulting in pervasive financial reporting implications for the Companies. The 2017 Tax Reform Act included significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including amendments which significantly change the taxation of individuals and business entities and included specific provisions related to regulated public utilities. The more significant changes that impact the Companies included in the 2017 Tax Reform Act are (i) reducing the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) effective in 2018, limiting the deductibility of interest expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income for certain businesses with any disallowed interest allowed to be carried forward indefinitely; (iii) permitting 100% expensing (100% bonus depreciation) for certain qualified property; (iv) eliminating the deduction for qualified domestic production activities; and (v) limiting the utilization of net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward. The specific provisions related to regulated public utilities in the 2017 Tax Reform Act generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, the exclusion from full expensing for tax purposes of certain property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and continued certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits.\nCertain agreements associated with Dominion Energy's credit facility contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominion Energy's ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from its subsidiaries at December 31, 2019.\n\nGains on sales of assets\n \u2022 A $348 million increase from rate adjustment clauses; \nDominion Energy is required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain its credit facility. In addition, Dominion Energy's credit agreement contains various terms and conditions that could affect its ability to borrow under the facility. They include a maximum debt to total capital ratio and cross-default provisions.\n \u2022 An $89 million decrease from rate adjustment clauses, which includes the impacts of the 2017 Tax Reform Act; partially offset by \n\nAccounting Matters\n, continued delays in obtaining and maintaining permits necessary for construction along with construction delays due to judicial actions have impacted the estimated cost and schedule for the Atlantic\n\n \u2022 A $46 million increase in sales to retail customers due to customer growth. \ndecreased 31%, primarily due to the acquisition of the public interest in Dominion Energy Midstream in January 2019.\nLiquidity And Capital Resources\nDominion Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred or when sufficient information becomes available to determine fair value and are generally capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the\nOther taxes\n, Dominion Energy's ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.\nInterest and related charges\n2018 VS. 2017\nincreased 25%, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory developments, including changes in federal and state tax laws and regulations; \n \u2022 Unusual weather conditions and their effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices; \nNoncontrolling interests\nPresented below are selected operating statistics related to Contracted Generation's operations:\nIf Dominion Energy or any of its material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require the defaulting company, if it is a borrower under Dominion Energy's credit facility, to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings and the lenders could terminate their commitments, if any, to lend funds to that company under the credit facility. In addition, if the defaulting company is Virginia Power, Dominion Energy's obligations to repay any outstanding borrowing under the credit facility could also be accelerated and the lenders' commitments to Dominion Energy could terminate.\nIncome tax expense\n \u2022 In May 2019, Virginia Power redeemed its $40 million 5.0% Economic Development Authority of the County of Chesterfield Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2009A, due in 2023 at the principal outstanding plus accrued interest. \nLeasing Arrangement\nOther income\nOutlook\n \u2022 Expected future risk premiums, asset classes' volatilities and correlations; \n\nbasis, are the key factors impacting Dominion Energy South Carolina's net income contribution:\nContracted Generation\nVirginia Power\n\nassets and liabilities.

In addition, the states in which the Companies operate may or may not conform to some or all the provisions in the 2017 Tax Reform Act. Ultimate resolution or clarification of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related\ndecreased 39%, primarily due to lower pre-tax\n \u2022 An $81 million increase due to a charge associated primarily with future ash pond and landfill closure costs in connection with the enactment of Virginia legislation in April 2018; \nWater\nincreased $233 million, primarily due to the sale of Fairless and Manchester ($210 million) and an increase in gains related to agreements to convey shale development rights under natural gas storage fields ($46 million).\n 63 \nAccounting for Regulated Operations\n\n \u2022 A $105 million charge for property, plant and equipment acquired in the SCANA Combination for which Dominion Energy committed to forgo recovery; \n \u2022 A $74 million decrease in Virginia Power electric capacity expense related to the annual PJM capacity performance market effective June 2019 ($63 million) and a contract termination with a non-utility generator ($37 million), partially offset by the annual PJM capacity performance market effective June 2018 ($26 million); \nDividend Restrictions\nThe accounting for Dominion Energy's regulated electric and gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that Dominion Energy is required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dominion Energy's healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2019 ranged from 6.50% to 6.60% and is expected to gradually decrease to 5.00% by 2025 and continue at that rate for years thereafter.\nAt December 31, 2019, Dominion Energy had $5.1 billion of unused capacity under its credit facility. See additional discussion below under Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt.\n2018 vs. 2017\nIn November 2019, the EPA released proposed revisions to the Effluent Limitations Guidelines rule that, if adopted, could extend the deadlines for compliance with certain standards at several facilities. While the impacts of this rule could be material to Dominion Energy's results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory frameworks in South Carolina and Virginia provide rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts for the regulated electric utilities.\n \u2022 Changes to regulated electric rates collected by Dominion Energy and Virginia Power and regulated gas distribution, transportation and storage rates, including LNG storage, collected by Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas; \nassociated with the Eastern Market Access Project ($37 million), partially offset by the absence of a charge to write-off\nThe expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net investment earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($720 million) and an increase in equity earnings from Atlantic Coast Pipeline ($50 million).\nNet income decreased 10%, primarily due to charges associated with the planned early retirement of certain electric generation facilities and automated meter reading infrastructure, a voluntary retirement program and a contract termination with a non-utility\nThe Companies make forward-looking statements with full knowledge that risks and uncertainties exist that may cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ are often presented with the forward-looking statements themselves. Additionally, other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement. These factors include but are not limited to:\n \u2022 The absence of an $81 million charge associated primarily with future ash pond and landfill closure costs in connection with the enactment of Virginia legislation in April 2018; and \n \u2022 A $238 million decrease for regulated generation and distribution operations as a result of the 2017 Tax Reform Act; \nCredit Facilities and Short-Term Debt\nDominion Energy has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion Energy has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.\n \u2022 A $74 million decrease in electric capacity expense primarily related to the annual PJM capacity performance market effective June 2019 ($63 million) and a contract termination with a non-utility generator ($37 million), partially offset by the annual PJM capacity performance market effective June 2018 ($26 million); and \n \u2022 Changes in future levels of domestic and international natural gas production, supply or consumption; \nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion Energy evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. Dominion Energy establishes a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not\nNet Income attributable to Dominion Energy decreased 45%, primarily due to charges for refunds of amounts previously collected from retail electric customers of DESC for the NND Project, litigation acquired in the SCANA Combination, a voluntary retirement program, the planned early retirement of certain Virginia Power electric generation facilities and the absence of gains on the sales of certain equity method investments. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net investment earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the operations acquired in the SCANA Combination.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nUse of Estimates in Long-lived Asset and Equity Method Investment Impairment Testing\nincreased $114 million, primarily due to the absence of capitalization of interest expense associated with the Liquefaction Facility upon completion of construction ($72 million) and Cove Point's term loan borrowings ($36 million).\nIn January 2019, in connection with the SCANA Combination, Dominion Energy issued 95.6 million shares of Dominion Energy common stock, valued at $6.8 billion, representing 0.6690 of a share of Dominion Energy common stock for each share of SCANA common stock outstanding at closing. SCANA's outstanding debt totaled $6.9 billion at closing.

Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on-\nincome ($256 million), the reduced corporate income tax rate ($235 million) and higher renewable energy investment tax credits ($35 million), partially offset by the absence of benefits resulting from the remeasurement of deferred income taxes to the new corporate income tax rate ($93 million).\nbasis, are the key factors impacting Gas Transmission & Storage's net income contribution:\nthe balance of a regulatory asset no longer considered probable of recovery ($15 million).\n \u2022 A $43 million decrease from the absence of certain merchant generation facilities sold in 2018. \n \u2022 Competition in the development, construction and ownership of certain electric transmission facilities in Dominion Energy and Virginia Power's service territory in connection with Order 1000; \ndecreased 20%, primarily due to lower earnings from Iroquois.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n2018 VS. 2017\n2019 VS. 2018\n \u2022 Risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are subject to changing regulatory structures; \n\nIn addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2019, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominion Energy's projected pension benefit obligation by $371 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $52 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $153 million.\n (4) Includes capital, operations and maintenance commitments. \nbasis, are the key factors impacting Contracted Generation's net income contribution:\n \u2022 Accounting Matters-Dominion Energy \n\n 59 \n \u2022 A $1.5 billion increase from the SCANA Combination, due to operations acquired ($2.5 billion), partially offset by a $1.0 billion charge for refunds of amounts previously collected from retail electric customers of DESC for the NND Project; \nrate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred.\nare made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion Energy's estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion Energy has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present.\n \u2022 A $113 million benefit from the revision of future ash pond and landfill closure costs as a result of Virginia legislation enacted in March 2019; \n Terminal Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2003 due in 2033 resulting in a reset of the interest rate from 1.55% to 1.70% until October 2022. \n \u2022 Changes in financial or regulatory accounting principles or policies imposed by governing bodies. \nDodd-Frank Act\nDominion Energy evaluates whether or not recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable as well as whether a regulatory liability due to customers is probable and makes various assumptions in its analyses.

These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. These cash flows include estimates on timing of decommissioning, which for regulated nuclear units factors in the probability of NRC approval for license extensions. In addition, Dominion Energy's cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. Dominion Energy determines cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be critical assumptions.\n \u2022 Risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities, including costs associated with the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, decommissioning, plant maintenance and changes in existing regulations governing such facilities; \nForward-looking Statements\n \u2022 A $102 million increase in storm damage and service restoration costs in the regulated electric service territory; \nOther income\nDominion Energy expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the Board of Directors.\nGains on sales of assets\nDuring 2019, Dominion Energy also issued the following long-term private debt:\nDominion Energy believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In December 2019, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors established an annual dividend rate for 2020 of $3.76 per share of common stock, a 2.5% increase over the 2019 rate. Dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. In January 2020, Dominion Energy's Board of Directors declared dividends payable in March 2020 of 94 cents per share of common stock.\n \u2022 The absence of charges for refunds of amounts previously collected from retail electric customers of DESC for the NND Project; \nThe 51-month\nIn connection with commodity hedging activities, Dominion Energy is required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, Dominion Energy may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, Dominion Energy may vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which Dominion Energy can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives.\n \u2022 Changes in operating, maintenance and construction costs; \nCorporate and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominion Energy's primary operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments' performance or in allocating resources.

In 2019, this primarily included $40 million of after-tax\nNet revenue\nasset and a corresponding finance lease liability at the commencement of the lease term. Dominion Energy will be considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes, and as a result, will be entitled to tax deductions for depreciation and interest expense.\n \u2022 A $348 million increase from Virginia Power rate adjustment clauses; \nNorth Anna\nCredit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion Energy believes that its current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion Energy may affect its ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominion Energy's credit ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities.\ndemand side management programs. Additionally, legislation has been proposed which may affect Dominion Energy's plans and/or cost recovery mechanisms for offshore wind development and replacing diesel school buses with electric school buses. Due to the evolving legislative process, Dominion Energy is unable to estimate the potential financial statement impacts related to matters currently under consideration by the Virginia General Assembly, but there could be a material impact to its results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nImpairment of assets and related charges\nemissions from natural gas pipeline compressor fuel-fire prime movers. States within the ozone transport region, including states in which Dominion Energy has natural gas operations, are expected to develop reasonably achievable control technology rules for existing sources based on the Ozone Transport Commission model rule. States outside of the Ozone Transport Commission may also consider the model rules in setting new reasonably achievable control technology standards. Several states in which Dominion Energy operates, including Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, Virginia and Ohio, are developing or have announced plans to develop state-specific regulations to control GHG emissions, including methane.\nprogram.\nPresented below is a summary of Dominion Energy Gas' consolidated results:\nOther income\n\nOther income\ncounter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility.

company decreased 45% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to charges for refunds related to the NND Project, litigation costs, early retirement of generation facilities, and lower gains on asset sales. \n\n- Operating revenue increased 23% in 2019 compared to 2018, mainly due to the SCANA Combination and full year of commercial operations of the Cove Point Liquefaction Facility. This was partially offset by lower merchant generation.\n\n- Interest expense increased 24% in 2019 due to debt acquired in the SCANA Combination and lower capitalized interest after the Cove Point facility entered service. \n\n- Income tax expense decreased 82% in 2019, largely due to lower pre-tax income and absence of tax reform benefits recognized in 2018.\n\n- Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $8.2 billion in 2020 and funded through operating cash flows, debt issuances, and equity issuances. Key drivers are growth projects in electric and gas infrastructure. \n\n- The company realigned its operating segments in 2019, resulting in five primary segments: Dominion Energy Virginia, Gas Transmission & Storage, Gas Distribution, Dominion Energy South Carolina, and Contracted Generation.\n\n- Overall earnings decreased due to fewer gains on asset sales, merger-related costs, and charges related to early plant retirements and NND Project refunds. This was partially offset by growth projects and operations from SCANA."}
