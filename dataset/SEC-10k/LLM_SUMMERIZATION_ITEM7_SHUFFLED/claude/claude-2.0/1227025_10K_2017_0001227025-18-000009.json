MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis by our management of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness overview\nWe develop, manufacture and sell optoelectronic products that transmit, receive and switch high speed digital optical signals for communications networks. We sell our products to the world's leading network equipment manufacturers, including Nokia (formerly Alcatel-Lucent, which was acquired by Nokia in January 2016), Ciena Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and its affiliate HiSilicon Technologies, Ltd. (collectively Huawei\u201d). These companies are among our largest customers and a focus of our strategy due to their leading market positions.\nWe have research and development and wafer fabrication facilities in San Jose and Fremont, California and in Tokyo, Japan that coordinate with our research and development and manufacturing facilities in Dongguan, Shenzhen and Wuhan, China and Ottawa, Canada. We use proprietary design tools and design-for-manufacturing techniques to align our design process with our precision nanoscale, vertically integrated manufacturing and testing. We believe we are one of the highest volume PIC manufacturers in the world and that we can further expand our manufacturing capacity to meet market needs.\nRecognizing our focus on growth in our 100Gbps ( 100G\u201d) and beyond products, we align our product group reporting to High Speed Products\u201d which includes products designed for 100G and beyond applications and Network Products and Solutions,\u201d which comprises all products designed for applications below 100G. In 2017 and 2016, High Speed Products represented approximately 83% and 67% of total revenue, respectively. In 2016, High Speed products were 82% of our proforma revenue when the revenue from our low speed transceiver products, sold in January 2017, is excluded. Network Products and Solutions represented approximately 17% and 33% of total revenue, in 2017 and 2016 respectively, and represented 18% of our proforma revenue in 2016 when the sold low speed transceiver products are excluded.\nIn 2017, the market situation for 100G and above product deployments in China materially affected our results. Demand from our China-based customers was very strong in 2016 with our customers at that time providing optimistic forecasts for 2017 in anticipation of new tenders for provincial and metro 100G system deployments from the leading Chinese telecom carriers. However, tender awards from the China telecom carriers were slower than expected, in 2017, causing demand for our products by our customers to drop significantly starting in the first quarter of 2017. We believe one or more of our leading customers in China had accumulated significant inventory prior to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. We also believe they and other customers rapidly moved to adjust their inventory by reducing their purchases of our products, beginning in the first quarter of 2017 to align with the slow market demand and their own production levels.\nWe believe the market faced issues with the timing of provincial deployments and of inventory management at certain customers. The transition in China from national backbone deployments to provincial backbone and metro deployments reduces our and our customers' visibility into the timing and volumes of tender awards, as the provincial offices of the China telecom carriers are somewhat independent of their national headquarters and each other. Our revenue growth in China was restricted by reduced demand and inventory overhang, both directly with our China based customers and through the impact on some of our non-China customers who also sell to customers in China.\nIn September 2017, China Mobile Communications Corporation awarded tenders for new provincial deployments to Huawei, ZTE Corporation and Fiberhome. This was followed in October 2017 by the issue of tenders by China United Network Communications Group Co., Ltd., or China Unicom, and we anticipate tenders will be issued in 2018 from China Telecommunications Corp, or China Telecom. While the timing is still uncertain, it is our expectation that these tender awards as well as new tender awards should create a more normalized demand environment in 2018.\nThese market developments in China have adversely affected our revenues, operating results and financial condition in 2017, as further addressed below.\nIn December 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement\u201d) with APAT Optoelectronics Components Co., Ltd. (the Purchaser\u201d) for the sale of certain assets of our access and low speed transceiver product lines (the Low Speed Transceiver Products\u201d) which was completed in January 2017. All of these products were part of our Network Products and Solutions group and include the low speed passive optical network, or PON, products for which the end-of-life plan was announced in mid-2016. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Low Speed Transceiver Products generated approximately 1%, 15% and 27% of our total revenue, respectively.\nThe asset sale consists of approximately $25.0 million in cash consideration plus approximately $1.4 million post-closing transition services under a transition services agreement (\"TSA\") with the Purchaser. We recognized a $2.2 million gain on the sale of these assets within operating loss in 2017. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nIn 2017, our revenue decline of 29% compared to 2016 was driven primarily due to a reduction in demand from China market as described above and lower revenue that resulted from the sale of assets related to our Low Speed Transceiver Products' assets in January 2017. Excluding the Low Speed Transceiver Products, our revenue in 2017 declined 16% compared to 2016. Our gross margin was 21.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 28.5% in the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in gross margin year over year was primarily attributable to under-utilization due to lower volumes in our manufacturing plants, inventory write-downs and reserves for non-cancelable purchase orders associated with excess inventory related to the demand reductions from China based customers, higher warranty reserves related to a quality rework requirement, lower yields at our wafer fabrication facility in Japan, restructuring costs and discontinued product inventory write-downs related to our decisions to end-of life certain products, partially offset by lower intangible amortization and stock-based compensation charges in 2017.\nIn 2018, we expect volume growth for our High Speed Products, although quarter-to-quarter results may show considerable variability due to customer demand fluctuations for current products as well as initial ramp-up variations on new product introductions. Similar to revenue, our gross margins may fluctuate materially depending on a variety of factors including average selling price changes, product mix, volume, manufacturing utilization and ongoing manufacturing process improvements.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flow, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation expense, impairment analysis of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation of inventory, purchased intangibles, warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue from the sale of our products provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue when the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer. We bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point. On most orders, our terms of sale provide that title passes to the buyer upon shipment by us. In certain cases, our terms of sale may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer. Revenue related to the sale of consignment inventory at customer vendor managed locations is not recognized until the product is pulled from inventory stock by customers. Payments made to third-party sales representatives are recorded to sales and marketing expense and not a reduction of revenue as the sales agent services they provide have an identifiable benefit and are made at similar rates of other sales agent service providers.\nThe amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgement. Contracts and/or customer purchase orders are assessed to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectability based\nprimarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer's payment history. Our estimates are based on historical experience. If the actual amounts are significantly different from our estimates, our operating results could have a material impact.\nStock-based compensation expense\nWe grant stock options, stock appreciation units and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. Stock purchase rights are granted to our employees. Stock-based awards are accounted for at fair value as of the measurement date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, the lattice-binominal option-pricing model or stock prices. For stock options and restricted stock units, the measurement date is the grant date and for employee stock purchase rights the measurement date is the first day of the offering period. Stock appreciation units are subject to re-measurement each reporting period.\nWe recognize the fair value over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. Stock-based compensation expense includes the impact of estimated forfeitures. We estimate future forfeitures at the date of grant and revise the estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nDetermining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rates and expected life. If any of these assumptions, or the market price of our common shares, used in the option-pricing models change, our stock-based compensation expense could materially change our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology; and discount rates.\nFair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Such assumptions are believed to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nAmounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.\nGoodwill and long-lived assets\nOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which generally results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including any contingent consideration.\nWe perform annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth fiscal quarter by reporting unit. We could be subject to additional goodwill impairment tests in the event of changes in industry and market conditions, our business and reporting structure. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we performed the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test and a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment and determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value of the underlying goodwill and a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of the reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill.\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. The estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows. If our estimates regarding future cash flows derived from such assets were to change, we may record an impairment to the value of these assets.\nValuation of inventories\nWe record inventories at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value, after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventories in excess of anticipated future demand. In assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories, we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand, the timing of new product introductions, economic trends and market conditions. If the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted, we could be required to record additional inventory write-downs which would be charged to cost of goods sold. Obsolescence is determined from several factors, including competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles. Write-downs of excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of goods sold. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. If this lower-cost inventory is subsequently sold, it will result in lower costs and higher gross margin for those products. Any write-downs would have an adverse impact on our gross margin. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, inventory write-down charges were approximately $8.3 million, $3.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Our inventory write-down charges in 2015 included a $2.8 million charge resulting from the phasing-out of our earlier-generation tunable laser products.\nWarranty liabilities\nWe provide warranties to cover defects in workmanship, materials and manufacturing of our products to meet stated functionality specifications. We test products against specified functionality requirements prior to delivery, but we nevertheless from time to time experience claims under our warranty guarantees. We accrue for estimated warranty costs under those guarantees based upon historical experience, and for specific items at the time their existence is known and the amounts are determinable. We charge a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities to cost of goods sold based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures. We recorded warranty expense of $1.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected.\nAccounting for income taxes\nWe record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally we consider all expected future events, other than enactments or changes in tax law or rates. We provide valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets.\nWe make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that the adjustment is determined to be required.\nResults of operations\nOur business is focused on the highest speed digital optics and signal processing communications applications for telecom transport and Metro networks and for data center applications. In 2017, our High Speed Products for data rates of 100G and beyond comprised 83% of our revenues. In 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement for the sale of assets of our Low Speed Transceiver Products within our Network Products and Solutions product group. In 2016 and 2015, the Low Speed Transceiver Products represent approximately 15% and 27% of total revenue, respectively. The asset sale was closed in January 2017.\nIn 2016, our stock-based stock options and stock appreciation units with market conditions vested when the average closing price of our common stock over 20 consecutive trading days exceeded $15.00 per share and we recorded approximately $5.7 million in related stock-based compensation expense within cost of goods sold and operating expenses.\nWe acquired the tunable laser product lines of EMCORE Corporation in January 2015 and the optical power monitoring business of EigenLight Corporation in November 2015 and the results of operations from these acquisitions are included from the date of acquisition.\nThe following table presents certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income, net\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>292,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe sell substantially all of our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. We price our products based on market and competitive conditions and may periodically reduce the price of our products as market and competitive conditions change and as manufacturing costs are reduced. Our sales transactions to customers are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, with some portions in Chinese Renminbi ( RMB\u201d) and Japanese Yen ( JPY\u201d). Revenue is driven by the volume of shipments and may be impacted by pricing pressures. We have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers.\nCustomers accounting for more than 10% of our total revenue and revenue from our top five customers for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of revenue from customers accounting for 10% or more of total revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd (1)\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ciena Corporation\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of revenue from top five customers\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Huawei's percentage of revenue included its affiliate, HiSilicon.

The decrease was approximately equally attributable to a reduction in demand from China telecom carrier tender awards with an inventory overhang at our Chinese customers as described further in the section entitled \"Business overview\" above and lower revenue that resulted from the sale of assets related to our Low Speed Transceiver Products in January 2017. Revenue generated by Low Speed Transceiver Products before the asset sale was $1.5 million in 2017, compared to $63.6 million in 2016. In 2017, High Speed Products\nrepresented approximately 83% of total revenue, compared to 67% of total revenue in 2016 while Network Products and Solutions represented approximately 17% of total revenue in 2017, compared to approximately 33% of total revenue in 2016, which included Low Speed Transceiver Products. In 2017, revenue from China, United States, Japan and rest of the world was 55%, 14%, 3%, and 28% of total revenue, respectively, compared to 62%, 16%, 3%, and 19% of total revenue respectively, in 2016.\nTotal revenue increased by $72.0 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from our High Speed Products driven by product demand, partially in China. Our High Speed Products increased to 67% of revenue in 2016 from 58% in 2015 and our Network Products and Solutions revenue decreased from 42% in 2015 to 33% in 2016. The increase in High Speed Products revenue was partially offset by a decrease in Network Products and Solutions revenue largely due to our product phase-out efforts to improve our gross margin. In 2016, total revenue from China, the United States, Japan and rest of the world was $254.7 million, $67.8 million, $12.0 million and $76.9 million, respectively, compared to $182.5 million, $77.9 million, $12.7 million and $66.4 million, respectively, in 2015.\nIn 2018, we expect to resume growth in revenue from our High Speed Products. We also expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers.\nCost of goods sold and gross margin\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit as a % of revenue\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost to produce wafers, modules and to manufacture and test our products. Additionally, our cost of goods sold includes stock-based compensation, write-downs of excess and obsolete inventory, royalty payments, amortization of certain purchased intangible assets, depreciation, acquisition-related fair value adjustments, restructuring cost, warranty, shipping and allocated facilities costs.\nIn 2017, gross profit decreased $55.7 million, or 48%, to $61.5 million in 2017, compared to $117.1 million in 2016. Our gross margin percent decreased by approximately eight percentage points to 21% in 2017 as compared to 2016. Approximately 6 percentage points of the decline in gross margin was driven by under-utilization attributable to lower volumes in our manufacturing plants, approximately 1.6 percentage points of the decline was due to inventory write-downs and reserves for non-cancelable purchase orders associated with excess inventory related to the demand reductions from China based customers and higher warranty reserves related to a quality rework requirement. These production volume declines were driven by: (a) lower end customer demand and therefore the need to decrease production and reduce inventory; and (b) lower output volumes at our wafer fabrication facility in Japan due to lower yields where we had end customer demand but could not support the demand with production output. Approximately 1 percentage point of the decline was driven by restructuring costs and discontinued product inventory write-downs related to our decisions to end-of life certain products. These gross margin reductions were offset by lower intangible amortization and stock-based compensation charges in 2017 which contributed 1.4 percentage points of improvement.\nIn 2016, gross profit increased $18.1 million, or 18%, to $117.1 million in 2016, compared to $99.1 million in 2015, primarily attributable to revenue growth, volume increase and cost reduction, partially offset by lower pricing, higher stock-based compensation expense and an unfavorable cost of goods sold impact as a result of the unrecoverable inventory associated with the bankruptcy reorganization by one of our distributors.\nOur gross margin percent decreased by approximately one percentage point to 28.5% in 2016 from 29.2% in 2015, primarily attributable to a $1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and $1.4 million of unfavorable cost of goods sold impact as a result of the unrecoverable inventory associated with the bankruptcy reorganization by one of our distributors and lower pricing, partially offset by production cost reduction and favorable product mix resulting from an increase in sales volume of our High Speed Products.\nWe expect that our gross profit and gross margin are likely to increase in 2018 due to a variety of factors, including favorable product mix, vertical integration, reduced amortization expense for purchased intangible assets and introduction of new products. Other factors that can affect our gross margin include production volume, inventory changes, changes in the\naverage selling prices of our products, changes in the cost and volumes of materials purchased from our suppliers, changes in labor costs, changes in overhead costs or requirements, revaluation of stock appreciation unit awards that are impacted by our stock price, write-downs of excess and obsolete inventories and warranty costs. In addition, we periodically negotiate pricing with certain customers which can cause our gross margins to fluctuate, particularly in the quarters subsequent to the periods in which the negotiations occurred.\nOperating expenses\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>17,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>34,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of purchase intangible assets\n</td> <td>472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and asset sale related costs\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on asset sale\n</td> <td>(2,193\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charge\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>3,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development\nWe focus our research and development effort primarily on the high speed market. Research and development expense increased $0.9 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in salaries and related expenses, a $1.2 million increase in facilities-related cost and $0.8 million increase in depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense compared to the 2016, which included higher stock-based compensation relating to a higher market price of our stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards and a $1.3 million decrease in variable compensation.\nResearch and development expense increased $12.8 million, or 29%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.1 million increase in development expenses largely driven by prototype and material spending, a $3.0 million increase in salaries and benefits, a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation and a $1.7 million increase in consulting fees for new product development.\nWe believe that investments in research and development are important to help meet our strategic objectives. In 2018, we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities, including new products that we believe will further enhance our competitive position. Research and development expense consists of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, for our research and development personnel, and product development costs, including engineering services, development software and hardware tools, depreciation of equipment and facility costs. We record all research and development expense as incurred. As a percentage of total revenue, our research and development expense may vary as our investment and revenue levels change over time.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expense decreased by $0.8 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $2.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense compared to the 2016, which included higher stock-based compensation relating to a higher market price of our stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards, and a $1.1 decrease in commissions and other variable compensation. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.6 million provision for bad debt expense in 2017, a $1.4 million increase in salaries and related expenses and a $0.3 million increase in product promotion costs.\nSales and marketing expense increased by $2.8 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $1.0 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $0.6 million increase in commission expense, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in bad debt provision largely due to collections.\nWe expect to continue to expand our high speed market focus and increase sales coverage of DCI market while controlling our sales and marketing expenses in 2018, even as our business continues to expand geographically. Sales and\nmarketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation and sales commissions, costs related to sales and marketing programs and services and facility costs. As a percentage of total revenue, our sales and marketing expense may vary as our revenue changes over time.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, for our finance, human resources and information technology personnel and certain executive officers, as well as professional services costs related to accounting, tax, banking, legal and information technology services, depreciation and facility costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense was flat in 2017 as compared to 2016. Increases included a $1.8 million increase in audit and accounting related fees and a $1.5 million increase in professional and legal expenses. These increases were offset by a $2.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense compared to the 2016, which included higher stock-based compensation relating to a higher market price of our stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards and $1.5 million decrease in variable compensation.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $2.8 million, or 9%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in stock-based compensation, a $0.7 million increase in salaries and benefits, and a $0.4 million increase in outside services driven by legal fees, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in variable compensation expenses.\nWe expect to continue to focus on controlling our general and administrative expense in 2018. As a percentage of total revenue, our general and administrative expense may vary as our revenue changes over time.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\nOur intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense relating to technology and patents and leasehold interests are included within cost of goods sold, while customer relationships and non-compete agreements are recorded within operating expenses.\nIn 2017, amortization of purchased intangible assets was $1.3 million, comprising of $0.8 million in cost of goods sold and $0.5 million in operating expenses. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by approximately $3.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2016.\nIn 2016, amortization of purchased intangible assets was $4.5 million, comprising of $2.9 million in cost of goods sold and $1.6 million in operating expenses. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by approximately $0.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to certain intangible assets from our past acquisitions being fully amortized.\nAcquisition and asset sale related costs\nIn 2017, we incurred $0.1 million in acquisition and asset sale related transaction costs related to legal, accounting and other professional services.\nIn 2016, we incurred $2.1 million in acquisition and asset sale related transaction costs related to legal, accounting and other professional services for our acquisition and asset sale activities.\nIn 2015, we incurred $0.9 million in acquisition-related transaction costs related to legal, accounting and other professional services for our acquisition activities, including our acquisitions of EMCORE's tunable laser product lines and EigenLight's optical power monitoring business.\nAsset impairment charge\nThere were no asset impairment charges in 2017 and 2016. In 2015, we recognized asset impairment charges of $0.4 million of which $0.2 million was attributable to a write-down of held-for-sale assets acquired from EMCORE and $0.2 million was attributable to charges for equipment related to our product phase out effort.\nRestructuring charges\nIn 2017, we initiated restructuring actions in order to focus on key growth initiatives and to achieve a lower break even revenue level through lower operating expenses and manufacturing costs. Actions included a reduction in force, facilities consolidation and certain asset-related adjustments. These actions are expected to reduce quarterly operating expenses and costs of goods sold by approximately $2.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively, when fully realized in the first quarter of 2018. We recorded $0.8 million and $3.9 million in restructuring charges within cost of goods sold and operating expenses in in 2017,\nrespectively. Additionally, we recorded a charge of $2.0 million to cost of goods sold in 2017 for discontinued product inventory write-downs related our decisions to end-of-life certain products.\nThere were no restructuring charges in 2016. We recorded $0.2 million in related restructuring charges in 2015, within cost of goods sold and operating expenses.\nInterest and other income (expense), net\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,060\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(384)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and other income (expense), net consists of interest income, interest expense and other income, net. Interest income consists of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest expense consists of amounts incurred for interest on our outstanding debt. Other income, net includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses along with government subsidies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in China and Japan is the RMB and the JPY, respectively.\nInterest expense included in interest and other income (expense), increased in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in interest expense was due to increase in outstanding borrowings during 2017.\nInterest and other income, net decreased $2.4 million, or 87%, in 2016 from $0.9 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $3.5 million decrease in other income, net driven by foreign exchange loss resulting from a weaker RMB and a stronger JPY against the U.S. dollars, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in interest expense and a $0.2 million increase in interest income.\nIncome taxes and effective tax rates\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(909\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,597\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, our income tax provision was primarily related to the operating profit realized in our foreign subsidiaries in Japan and China. Historically, we have experienced net losses in the U.S. and in the short term, we expect this trend to continue.\nThe effective tax rate was (2)% in 2017 as compared to 106% in 2016 mainly due to lower earnings in foreign jurisdictions and increase in net loss generated in the U.S. in 2017.\nIn 2016, our income tax provision was primarily related to the operating profit realized in our foreign subsidiaries in Japan and China. Historically, we have experienced net losses in the U.S. and in the short term, we expect this trend to continue. In China, one of our subsidiaries changed from a preferential 15% tax rate available for high technology enterprises to 25% for 2016. The preferential rate applied to 2015 and 2014. We realized benefits from this 10% reduction in the tax rate of $0.9 million and $0.5 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate in 2016 of 106% was 60 percentage points higher than the 2015 effective tax rate mainly due to the non-recurring vesting of the stock-based awards with a market condition in 2016 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in our tax rate in China.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. President signed into U.S. law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\"). The new legislation, among other provisions, will lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition to applying the new lower corporate tax rate in 2018 and thereafter to any taxable income we may have, the legislation affects the way we can use and carry forward net operating losses previously accumulated and results in a revaluation of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet. Given that the deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance, we believe these changes will have no net impact on our financial position and net loss. However, if and when we become profitable, we will receive a reduced benefit from such deferred tax assets. In addition, the Tax Reform includes a one-time mandatory repatriation transition tax on the net accumulated earnings and profits of a US taxpayer's foreign subsidiaries. We have performed an earnings and profits\nanalysis, and as a result of net operating loss carry forward available to fully offset the anticipated transition tax, we believe there will be no income tax effect in the current period.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $110.8 million, including total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash of $93.9 million. Approximately 31% of our total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash were held by our foreign entities, including approximately $25.9 million in accounts held by our subsidiaries in China, of which $2.7 million was in restricted cash, and approximately $2.7 million in accounts held by our subsidiary in Japan. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash held outside of the U.S. may be subject to taxes if repatriated and may not be immediately available for our working capital needs.\nApproximately $8.8 million of our retained earnings within our total accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2017 was subject to restrictions due to the fact that our subsidiaries in China are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year end to fund statutory common reserves as well as allocate a discretionary portion of their after-tax profits to their staff welfare and bonus fund. This restricted amount is not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation.\nIn January 2017, we completed the sale of certain Low Speed Transceiver Products' assets for approximately $25.0 million in consideration plus approximately $1.4 million for a post-closing transition services arrangement. The consideration was reduced by $3.4 million for inventory adjustment after closing to approximately $21.6 million, which was subject to other adjustments of up to $10.0 million for any potential claims. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nIn September 2017 we entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\"Wells Fargo\") as the administrative agent for a lender group (the \"Wells Fargo Credit Facility\" or \"Credit Facility\"), and the $20.0 million amount outstanding under our Comerica Bank Credit Facility, which has since been terminated, was paid in full.\nThe Wells Fargo Credit Facility provides for borrowings equal to the lower of (a) a maximum revolver amount of $50.0 million, or (b) an amount equal to 80% - 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus 100% of qualified cash balances up to $15.0 million, less certain discretionary adjustments (\"Borrowing Base\"). The maximum revolver amount may be increased by up to $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions. At closing, $50.0 million was available, of which $30.0 million was drawn. We used $20.0 million of this amount to pay the principal and interest due under the Comerica Bank Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility matures on June 30, 2022 and borrowings bear interest at an interest rate option of either (a) the LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 1.75% per annum, or (b) the prime lending rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.50% to 0.75% per annum. We are also required to pay a commitment fee equal to 0.25% of the unused portion of the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility agreement requires prepayment of the borrowings to the extent the outstanding balance is greater than the lesser of (a) the most recently calculated Borrowing Base, or (b) the maximum revolver amount. The Borrowing Base calculation contains a customary provision that gives the lender the ability to reduce the Borrowing Base by reserves that are subjectively determinable, which is considered a subjective acceleration clause. We are required to maintain a combination of certain defined cash balances and unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of at least $20.0 million, of which at least $5.0 million must be unused borrowing capacity. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. We were in compliance with the covenants of this Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was $30.0 million and the weighted average rate under the LIBOR option was 3.29%. The remaining borrowing capacity was $20.0 million of which $5.0 million is required to be maintained as unused borrowing capacity.\nWe regularly issue short-term notes payable to our suppliers in China in exchange for accounts payable. These notes are supported by non-interest bearing bank acceptance drafts and are due three to six months after issuance. As a condition of the notes payable arrangements, we are required to keep a compensating balance at the issuing banks that is a percentage of the total notes payable balance until the amounts are settled. As of December 31, 2017, our subsidiary in China had three line of credit facilities with banking institutions. The total amount available for short-term borrowings under these line of credit facilities as of December 31, 2017 was $43.4 million. In July 2017, we borrowed $17.0 million under a line of credit facility with CITIC Bank which was repaid when due in January 2018. This line of credit facility expired in September 2017, but was renewed in December 2017 with a new expiration date of November 2018. In February 2018, we borrowed $17.0 million from CITIC Bank under the credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the non-interest bearing bank acceptance drafts issued in connection with our notes payable to our suppliers in China under these line of credit facilities had an outstanding balance of $1.6 million and $6.4 million, respectively. Compensating balances relating to these credit facilities totaled $0.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Compensating balances are classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 3 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had three loan arrangements with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (collectively the Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans\u201d). One of Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans requires interest only payments until the maturity date of February 23, 2018, with a lump sum payment of the aggregate principal amount on the maturity date while the other requires equal monthly payments of principal equal to 8,333,000 JPY until the maturity date of February 25, 2025, with a lump sum payment of the balance of 8,373,000 JPY on the maturity date. Interest on these loans accrues and is paid monthly based upon the annual rate of the monthly Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate (TIBOR) plus 1.40% and is secured by real estate collateral. The third term loan of 690 million JPY (approximately $6.2 million) (the 2017 Mitsubishi Bank Loan\u201d) was entered into in March 2017 to acquire manufacturing equipment for our Japanese subsidiary and has an annual interest rate of the monthly TIBOR rate plus 1.00%. The 2017 Mitsubishi Bank Loan requires monthly interest and principal payments over 72 months commencing in April 2018. This loan is available from March 31, 2017 to March 30, 2018 and 690 million JPY (approximately $6.1 million) under this loan was fully drawn as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, our total outstanding principal balance under the Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans was 1.9 billion JPY (approximately $16.9 million). See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report. In January 2018, we repaid one of the Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans of 500 million JPY (approximately $4.4 million).\nIn January 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (the \"Mitsubishi Bank\") and The Yamanashi Chou Bank, Ltd. for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 850 million JPY (approximately $7.8 million). The full amount of the term loan of 850 million JPY (approximately $7.8 million) was drawn in January 2018. Interest on this term loan is based upon the annual rate of the three months TIBOR rate plus 1.00%. This term loan requires quarterly interest payments, along with the principal payments, over 82 months commencing in April 2018.\nFrom time to time we accept notes receivable in exchange for accounts receivable from certain of our customers in China. These notes receivable are non-interest bearing and are generally due within six months. Historically, we have collected on the notes receivable in full at the time of maturity.\nIn 2017, we generated operating losses of $51.4 million and negative cash flows from operations of $32.8 million. We had an accumulated deficit of $352.0 million as of December 31, 2017. Our operating results and cash flows during this period have been negatively affected by reduced demand in China stemming from delayed provincial deployments and a buildup of inventory at one or more of our leading customers, which is expected to continue into early 2018. In response, we implemented restructuring plans in May and September 2017 that included a reduction in force and consolidation of facilities, which are expected to reduce quarterly expenses by approximately $2.6 million when fully realized in the first quarter of 2018. We also reduced or delayed certain product development projects and capital expenditures, aggressively pursued collections of accounts and notes receivable and continued to closely manage production and inventory levels.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit agreement with Wells Fargo, was $20.0 million of which $5.0 million is required to be maintained as unused borrowing capacity. As of December 31, 2017, we also have approximately $5.5 million available for short-term borrowings under two line of credit agreements in China that expire in July 2019 and approximately $37.9 million under third line of credit agreement with CITIC Bank in China that expires in November 2018. As of December 31, 2017, $17.0 million was due to CITIC Bank under an old line of credit, which was repaid in January 2018. Additionally, we had $6.0 million of current portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2017, of which we paid $4.4 million in January 2018 and plan to pay out the remaining current portion of long-term debt out of our existing available cash. As noted above, in January 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with Mitsubishi Bank and The Yamanashi Chou Bank, Ltd. for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 850 million JPY (approximately $7.8 million). In February 2018, we borrowed $17.0 million under third line of credit agreement with CITIC Bank in China that expires in November 2018.\nWe believe we will have sufficient resources to fund our currently planned operations and expenditures over the next twelve months without additional financing or other actions. In addition, we believe there are a number of ongoing and potential actions that may further strengthen our projected cash and projected financial position.\nWe operate in an industry that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate with certainty. Future declines in China market demand or other changes to our forecasts could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As a result, we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund our operations. Any additional debt arrangements may\nlikely require regular interest or principal payments which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that additional debt or equity capital will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\nRusnano Rights Agreement\nUnder our amended rights agreement, dated June 30, 2015, with Rusnano, one of our principal stockholders, we agreed to a $30.0 million investment commitment (the Investment Commitment\u201d) toward our Russian operations. The Investment Commitment can be partially satisfied by cash and/or non-cash investment inside or outside of Russia. Our $21.0 million investment milestone for 2016 was met as of December 31, 2016. If certain of the Investment Commitments are not achieved in the indicated time frames through 2019, we have the ability to exit our Russian operations by paying an exit fee of up to $2.0 million. See Note 13, Commitments and contingencies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information.\nCash flow discussion\nThe table below sets forth selected cash flow data for the periods presented:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,767\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(15,676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49,470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,906\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>43,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>1,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,594\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nIn 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $32.8 million, compared to $53.8 million net cash provided by operating activities in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $48.3 million decrease in cash flows related to net loss and non-cash adjustments, $34.0 million decrease in cash flows related to decreased accounts payable, $21.0 million decrease in cash flows related to a buildup in inventories in the first half of 2017. The decreases were partially offset by a $10.7 million increase in cash flows from collection of accounts receivable primarily driven by lower revenue and strong collections and a $6.2 million increase in cash flows from accrued and other liabilities primarily relating to the TSA with APAT OE payable in the current year.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $53.8 million, a $27.7 million increase compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $27.8 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments, a $13.6 million increase attributable to inventory shipments driven by product demand and a $1.8 million increase in net income net of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease related to higher prepaid and other assets primarily due to a reduction in prepaid taxes in 2015, a $6.0 million decrease related to lower accrued and other liabilities balance primarily due to variable compensation accrual for 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $26.1 million, a $26.6 million increase compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $23.4 million increase in net income, a $15.8 million increase driven by lower accounts receivable due to collections, a $5.7 million increase in accrued and other liabilities, a $4.2 million increase in prepaid and other assets, partially offset by a $19.9 million decrease related to inventory increases due to anticipated demand and a $5.7 million decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments.\nInvesting activities\nIn 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $15.7 million, a $33.8 million decrease compared to $49.5 million used in 2016. The decrease in net cash used in investment activities was primarily attributable to a $21.6 million in proceeds from the sale of our Low Speed Transceiver Products' assets in January 2017 and a $4.3 million decrease in property, plant and equipment purchases in 2017.\nIn 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $49.5 million, a $27.6 million increase compared to $21.9 million used in 2015. The increase in net cash used in investment activities was primarily attributable to a $45.6 million increase in purchased marketable securities, a $34.9 million increase in property, plant and equipment purchases to meet our product demand, a $10.8 million increase as a result of a large restricted cash decrease in 2015 and a $1.6 million increase due to\nforeign currency hedge settlement payments, partially offset by a $45.7 million increase in proceeds from sales of marketable securities, a $19.1 million increase in proceeds from maturity of securities and a $0.4 million reduction in cash used in business acquisition compared to 2015.\nIn 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $21.9 million, an $8.0 million increase compared to $13.9 million used in 2014. The increase in net cash used in investment activities was primarily attributable to a $27.5 million increase in purchased marketable securities, a $5.8 million increase in property, plant and equipment purchases and a $5.4 million reduction in proceeds from maturity of securities, partially offset by a $21.0 million increase as a result of decreases in restricted cash balances and an $8.5 million increase in proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nFinancing activities\nIn 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $43.1 million, a $39.6 million increase compared to $3.5 million in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to $30.0 million in new borrowing under our Wells Fargo Credit Facility ($10.0 million net of repayment of $20.0 million owed under the Comerica Bank Credit Facility), and $34.0 million from notes payable to banks in China.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.5 million, a $26.1 million decrease compared to $29.6 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $45.8 million decrease largely attributable to the $45.6 million net proceeds from our follow-on public offering in 2015, a $5.2 million decrease related to lower net proceeds from issuance of notes payable and a $2.1 million decrease in repayments of bank and acquisition-related loans, partially offset by a $14.9 million increase in proceeds from bank loans and a $7.5 million increase due to lower repayments of notes payable and a $3.9 million increase due to higher proceeds from exercise of stock options and issuance of stock under employee stock purchase plan primarily attributable higher average common stock price in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $29.6 million, a $26.6 million increase compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $62.2 million increase in net proceeds from bank and acquisition-related loans, a $45.6 million net proceeds from issuance of common stock in public offering, partially offset by a $75.6 million decrease in loans and acquisition-related loan payments, a $4.0 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of notes payable and a $3.4 million decrease in the repayments of notes payable.\nContractual obligations and commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td>

As noted above, in January 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with Mitsubishi Bank and The Yamanashi Chou Bank, Ltd. for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 850 million JPY (approximately $7.8 million). In February 2018, we borrowed $17.0 million under third line of credit agreement with CITIC Bank in China that expires in November 2018.\nWe believe that investments in research and development are important to help meet our strategic objectives. In 2018, we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities, including new products that we believe will further enhance our competitive position. Research and development expense consists of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, for our research and development personnel, and product development costs, including engineering services, development software and hardware tools, depreciation of equipment and facility costs. We record all research and development expense as incurred. As a percentage of total revenue, our research and development expense may vary as our investment and revenue levels change over time.\nWe make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that the adjustment is determined to be required.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of revenue from customers accounting for 10% or more of total revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd (1)\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ciena Corporation\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of revenue from top five customers\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (7) We calculate the expected interest payments based on our long-term debt at prevailing interest rates as of December 31, 2017.

The Borrowing Base calculation contains a customary provision that gives the lender the ability to reduce the Borrowing Base by reserves that are subjectively determinable, which is considered a subjective acceleration clause. We are required to maintain a combination of certain defined cash balances and unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of at least $20.0 million, of which at least $5.0 million must be unused borrowing capacity. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. We were in compliance with the covenants of this Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was $30.0 million and the weighted average rate under the LIBOR option was 3.29%. The remaining borrowing capacity was $20.0 million of which $5.0 million is required to be maintained as unused borrowing capacity.\nWe recognize the fair value over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. Stock-based compensation expense includes the impact of estimated forfeitures. We estimate future forfeitures at the date of grant and revise the estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nWe operate in an industry that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate with certainty. Future declines in China market demand or other changes to our forecasts could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As a result, we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund our operations. Any additional debt arrangements may\nWe focus our research and development effort primarily on the high speed market. Research and development expense increased $0.9 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in salaries and related expenses, a $1.2 million increase in facilities-related cost and $0.8 million increase in depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense compared to the 2016, which included higher stock-based compensation relating to a higher market price of our stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards and a $1.3 million decrease in variable compensation.\n (6) We have an asset retirement obligation of $3.1 million associated with our facility lease in California which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. We also have a $0.1 million asset retirement obligation in Japan. \nGoodwill and long-lived assets\nWe grant stock options, stock appreciation units and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. Stock purchase rights are granted to our employees. Stock-based awards are accounted for at fair value as of the measurement date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, the lattice-binominal option-pricing model or stock prices. For stock options and restricted stock units, the measurement date is the grant date and for employee stock purchase rights the measurement date is the first day of the offering period. Stock appreciation units are subject to re-measurement each reporting period.\nWe sell substantially all of our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. We price our products based on market and competitive conditions and may periodically reduce the price of our products as market and competitive conditions change and as manufacturing costs are reduced. Our sales transactions to customers are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, with some portions in Chinese Renminbi ( RMB\u201d) and Japanese Yen ( JPY\u201d). Revenue is driven by the volume of shipments and may be impacted by pricing pressures. We have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers.\nInvesting activities\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nStock-based compensation expense\nIn September 2017 we entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\"Wells Fargo\") as the administrative agent for a lender group (the \"Wells Fargo Credit Facility\" or \"Credit Facility\"), and the $20.0 million amount outstanding under our Comerica Bank Credit Facility, which has since been terminated, was paid in full.\n\n (4) This is an estimate of the amount outstanding under open purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other goods at December 31, 2017. Certain of these open purchase orders may be cancellable without penalty. \nResearch and development expense increased $12.8 million, or 29%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.1 million increase in development expenses largely driven by prototype and material spending, a $3.0 million increase in salaries and benefits, a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation and a $1.7 million increase in consulting fees for new product development.\nanalysis, and as a result of net operating loss carry forward available to fully offset the anticipated transition tax, we believe there will be no income tax effect in the current period.\nAsset impairment charge\nGeneral and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, for our finance, human resources and information technology personnel and certain executive officers, as well as professional services costs related to accounting, tax, banking, legal and information technology services, depreciation and facility costs.\nFair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Such assumptions are believed to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nInterest and other income (expense), net consists of interest income, interest expense and other income, net. Interest income consists of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest expense consists of amounts incurred for interest on our outstanding debt. Other income, net includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses along with government subsidies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in China and Japan is the RMB and the JPY, respectively.\nIn 2017, amortization of purchased intangible assets was $1.3 million, comprising of $0.8 million in cost of goods sold and $0.5 million in operating expenses. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by approximately $3.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2016.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $26.1 million, a $26.6 million increase compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $23.4 million increase in net income, a $15.8 million increase driven by lower accounts receivable due to collections, a $5.7 million increase in accrued and other liabilities, a $4.2 million increase in prepaid and other assets, partially offset by a $19.9 million decrease related to inventory increases due to anticipated demand and a $5.7 million decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nIn 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $49.5 million, a $27.6 million increase compared to $21.9 million used in 2015. The increase in net cash used in investment activities was primarily attributable to a $45.6 million increase in purchased marketable securities, a $34.9 million increase in property, plant and equipment purchases to meet our product demand, a $10.8 million increase as a result of a large restricted cash decrease in 2015 and a $1.6 million increase due to\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nIncome taxes and effective tax rates\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis by our management of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nThere were no restructuring charges in 2016. We recorded $0.2 million in related restructuring charges in 2015, within cost of goods sold and operating expenses.\nIn connection with our April 2012 common stock private placement transaction, we entered into a rights agreement with Rusnano. Refer to the discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Rusnano Rights Agreement\u201d section.\nlikely require regular interest or principal payments which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that additional debt or equity capital will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology; and discount rates.\nSales and marketing\nIn December 2017, the U.S. President signed into U.S. law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\"). The new legislation, among other provisions, will lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition to applying the new lower corporate tax rate in 2018 and thereafter to any taxable income we may have, the legislation affects the way we can use and carry forward net operating losses previously accumulated and results in a revaluation of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet. Given that the deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance, we believe these changes will have no net impact on our financial position and net loss. However, if and when we become profitable, we will receive a reduced benefit from such deferred tax assets. In addition, the Tax Reform includes a one-time mandatory repatriation transition tax on the net accumulated earnings and profits of a US taxpayer's foreign subsidiaries. We have performed an earnings and profits\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had three loan arrangements with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (collectively the Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans\u201d). One of Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans requires interest only payments until the maturity date of February 23, 2018, with a lump sum payment of the aggregate principal amount on the maturity date while the other requires equal monthly payments of principal equal to 8,333,000 JPY until the maturity date of February 25, 2025, with a lump sum payment of the balance of 8,373,000 JPY on the maturity date. Interest on these loans accrues and is paid monthly based upon the annual rate of the monthly Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate (TIBOR) plus 1.40% and is secured by real estate collateral. The third term loan of 690 million JPY (approximately $6.2 million) (the 2017 Mitsubishi Bank Loan\u201d) was entered into in March 2017 to acquire manufacturing equipment for our Japanese subsidiary and has an annual interest rate of the monthly TIBOR rate plus 1.00%. The 2017 Mitsubishi Bank Loan requires monthly interest and principal payments over 72 months commencing in April 2018. This loan is available from March 31, 2017 to March 30, 2018 and 690 million JPY (approximately $6.1 million) under this loan was fully drawn as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, our total outstanding principal balance under the Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans was 1.9 billion JPY (approximately $16.9 million). See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report. In January 2018, we repaid one of the Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans of 500 million JPY (approximately $4.4 million).\n\nRestructuring charges\nLiquidity and capital resources\nResearch and development\nIn 2017, we initiated restructuring actions in order to focus on key growth initiatives and to achieve a lower break even revenue level through lower operating expenses and manufacturing costs. Actions included a reduction in force, facilities consolidation and certain asset-related adjustments. These actions are expected to reduce quarterly operating expenses and costs of goods sold by approximately $2.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively, when fully realized in the first quarter of 2018. We recorded $0.8 million and $3.9 million in restructuring charges within cost of goods sold and operating expenses in in 2017,\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\nIn 2017, gross profit decreased $55.7 million, or 48%, to $61.5 million in 2017, compared to $117.1 million in 2016. Our gross margin percent decreased by approximately eight percentage points to 21% in 2017 as compared to 2016. Approximately 6 percentage points of the decline in gross margin was driven by under-utilization attributable to lower volumes in our manufacturing plants, approximately 1.6 percentage points of the decline was due to inventory write-downs and reserves for non-cancelable purchase orders associated with excess inventory related to the demand reductions from China based customers and higher warranty reserves related to a quality rework requirement. These production volume declines were driven by: (a) lower end customer demand and therefore the need to decrease production and reduce inventory; and (b) lower output volumes at our wafer fabrication facility in Japan due to lower yields where we had end customer demand but could not support the demand with production output. Approximately 1 percentage point of the decline was driven by restructuring costs and discontinued product inventory write-downs related to our decisions to end-of life certain products. These gross margin reductions were offset by lower intangible amortization and stock-based compensation charges in 2017 which contributed 1.4 percentage points of improvement.\nApproximately $8.8 million of our retained earnings within our total accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2017 was subject to restrictions due to the fact that our subsidiaries in China are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year end to fund statutory common reserves as well as allocate a discretionary portion of their after-tax profits to their staff welfare and bonus fund. This restricted amount is not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation.\nInterest expense included in interest and other income (expense), increased in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in interest expense was due to increase in outstanding borrowings during 2017.\nOur gross margin percent decreased by approximately one percentage point to 28.5% in 2016 from 29.2% in 2015, primarily attributable to a $1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and $1.4 million of unfavorable cost of goods sold impact as a result of the unrecoverable inventory associated with the bankruptcy reorganization by one of our distributors and lower pricing, partially offset by production cost reduction and favorable product mix resulting from an increase in sales volume of our High Speed Products.\nOperating expenses\nValuation of inventories\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe acquired the tunable laser product lines of EMCORE Corporation in January 2015 and the optical power monitoring business of EigenLight Corporation in November 2015 and the results of operations from these acquisitions are included from the date of acquisition.\nIn December 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement\u201d) with APAT Optoelectronics Components Co., Ltd. (the Purchaser\u201d) for the sale of certain assets of our access and low speed transceiver product lines (the Low Speed Transceiver Products\u201d) which was completed in January 2017. All of these products were part of our Network Products and Solutions group and include the low speed passive optical network, or PON, products for which the end-of-life plan was announced in mid-2016. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Low Speed Transceiver Products generated approximately 1%, 15% and 27% of our total revenue, respectively.\n (1) See Note 11, Debt, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information regarding our debt. \n (3) We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our offices in China, U.S. and Canada. \nIn 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $21.9 million, an $8.0 million increase compared to $13.9 million used in 2014. The increase in net cash used in investment activities was primarily attributable to a $27.5 million increase in purchased marketable securities, a $5.8 million increase in property, plant and equipment purchases and a $5.4 million reduction in proceeds from maturity of securities, partially offset by a $21.0 million increase as a result of decreases in restricted cash balances and an $8.5 million increase in proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nThe amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgement. Contracts and/or customer purchase orders are assessed to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectability based\nContractual obligations and commitments\nSales and marketing expense increased by $2.8 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $1.0 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $0.6 million increase in commission expense, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in bad debt provision largely due to collections.\nBusiness overview\nIn 2017, we incurred $0.1 million in acquisition and asset sale related transaction costs related to legal, accounting and other professional services.\nWe expect to continue to expand our high speed market focus and increase sales coverage of DCI market while controlling our sales and marketing expenses in 2018, even as our business continues to expand geographically. Sales and\n (5) See Note 13, Commitments and contingencies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information regarding our Rusnano Payment Derivative. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\n\nWe expect that our gross profit and gross margin are likely to increase in 2018 due to a variety of factors, including favorable product mix, vertical integration, reduced amortization expense for purchased intangible assets and introduction of new products. Other factors that can affect our gross margin include production volume, inventory changes, changes in the\nIn 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.5 million, a $26.1 million decrease compared to $29.6 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $45.8 million decrease largely attributable to the $45.6 million net proceeds from our follow-on public offering in 2015, a $5.2 million decrease related to lower net proceeds from issuance of notes payable and a $2.1 million decrease in repayments of bank and acquisition-related loans, partially offset by a $14.9 million increase in proceeds from bank loans and a $7.5 million increase due to lower repayments of notes payable and a $3.9 million increase due to higher proceeds from exercise of stock options and issuance of stock under employee stock purchase plan primarily attributable higher average common stock price in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $53.8 million, a $27.7 million increase compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $27.8 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments, a $13.6 million increase attributable to inventory shipments driven by product demand and a $1.8 million increase in net income net of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease related to higher prepaid and other assets primarily due to a reduction in prepaid taxes in 2015, a $6.0 million decrease related to lower accrued and other liabilities balance primarily due to variable compensation accrual for 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn 2017, we generated operating losses of $51.4 million and negative cash flows from operations of $32.8 million. We had an accumulated deficit of $352.0 million as of December 31, 2017. Our operating results and cash flows during this period have been negatively affected by reduced demand in China stemming from delayed provincial deployments and a buildup of inventory at one or more of our leading customers, which is expected to continue into early 2018. In response, we implemented restructuring plans in May and September 2017 that included a reduction in force and consolidation of facilities, which are expected to reduce quarterly expenses by approximately $2.6 million when fully realized in the first quarter of 2018. We also reduced or delayed certain product development projects and capital expenditures, aggressively pursued collections of accounts and notes receivable and continued to closely manage production and inventory levels.\nThere were no asset impairment charges in 2017 and 2016. In 2015, we recognized asset impairment charges of $0.4 million of which $0.2 million was attributable to a write-down of held-for-sale assets acquired from EMCORE and $0.2 million was attributable to charges for equipment related to our product phase out effort.\nThe table below sets forth selected cash flow data for the periods presented:\nforeign currency hedge settlement payments, partially offset by a $45.7 million increase in proceeds from sales of marketable securities, a $19.1 million increase in proceeds from maturity of securities and a $0.4 million reduction in cash used in business acquisition compared to 2015.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nIn 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $15.7 million, a $33.8 million decrease compared to $49.5 million used in 2016. The decrease in net cash used in investment activities was primarily attributable to a $21.6 million in proceeds from the sale of our Low Speed Transceiver Products' assets in January 2017 and a $4.3 million decrease in property, plant and equipment purchases in 2017.\nWe regularly issue short-term notes payable to our suppliers in China in exchange for accounts payable. These notes are supported by non-interest bearing bank acceptance drafts and are due three to six months after issuance. As a condition of the notes payable arrangements, we are required to keep a compensating balance at the issuing banks that is a percentage of the total notes payable balance until the amounts are settled. As of December 31, 2017, our subsidiary in China had three line of credit facilities with banking institutions. The total amount available for short-term borrowings under these line of credit facilities as of December 31, 2017 was $43.4 million. In July 2017, we borrowed $17.0 million under a line of credit facility with CITIC Bank which was repaid when due in January 2018. This line of credit facility expired in September 2017, but was renewed in December 2017 with a new expiration date of November 2018. In February 2018, we borrowed $17.0 million from CITIC Bank under the credit facility.\nThe following table presents certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue:\nDetermining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rates and expected life. If any of these assumptions, or the market price of our common shares, used in the option-pricing models change, our stock-based compensation expense could materially change our consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2017, our income tax provision was primarily related to the operating profit realized in our foreign subsidiaries in Japan and China. Historically, we have experienced net losses in the U.S. and in the short term, we expect this trend to continue.\nIn 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $43.1 million, a $39.6 million increase compared to $3.5 million in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to $30.0 million in new borrowing under our Wells Fargo Credit Facility ($10.0 million net of repayment of $20.0 million owed under the Comerica Bank Credit Facility), and $34.0 million from notes payable to banks in China.\n\nIn 2016, our income tax provision was primarily related to the operating profit realized in our foreign subsidiaries in Japan and China. Historically, we have experienced net losses in the U.S. and in the short term, we expect this trend to continue. In China, one of our subsidiaries changed from a preferential 15% tax rate available for high technology enterprises to 25% for 2016. The preferential rate applied to 2015 and 2014. We realized benefits from this 10% reduction in the tax rate of $0.9 million and $0.5 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFrom time to time we accept notes receivable in exchange for accounts receivable from certain of our customers in China. These notes receivable are non-interest bearing and are generally due within six months. Historically, we have collected on the notes receivable in full at the time of maturity.\n (1) Huawei's percentage of revenue included its affiliate, HiSilicon. Revenue from HiSilicon represented approximately 37%, 36% and 23% of total revenue, respectively, in 2017, 2016 and 2015.  For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our percentage of sales from our China-based subsidiaries, the majority of which were denominated in RMB, were 1%, 4% and 5%, respectively.\nIn 2015, we incurred $0.9 million in acquisition-related transaction costs related to legal, accounting and other professional services for our acquisition activities, including our acquisitions of EMCORE's tunable laser product lines and EigenLight's optical power monitoring business.\nThe Credit Facility matures on June 30, 2022 and borrowings bear interest at an interest rate option of either (a) the LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 1.75% per annum, or (b) the prime lending rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.50% to 0.75% per annum. We are also required to pay a commitment fee equal to 0.25% of the unused portion of the Credit Facility.\n____________________________________________\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\nCash flow discussion\nIn 2017, our revenue decline of 29% compared to 2016 was driven primarily due to a reduction in demand from China market as described above and lower revenue that resulted from the sale of assets related to our Low Speed Transceiver Products' assets in January 2017. Excluding the Low Speed Transceiver Products, our revenue in 2017 declined 16% compared to 2016. Our gross margin was 21.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 28.5% in the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in gross margin year over year was primarily attributable to under-utilization due to lower volumes in our manufacturing plants, inventory write-downs and reserves for non-cancelable purchase orders associated with excess inventory related to the demand reductions from China based customers, higher warranty reserves related to a quality rework requirement, lower yields at our wafer fabrication facility in Japan, restructuring costs and discontinued product inventory write-downs related to our decisions to end-of life certain products, partially offset by lower intangible amortization and stock-based compensation charges in 2017.\nThe asset sale consists of approximately $25.0 million in cash consideration plus approximately $1.4 million post-closing transition services under a transition services agreement (\"TSA\") with the Purchaser. We recognized a $2.2 million gain on the sale of these assets within operating loss in 2017. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nWe perform annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth fiscal quarter by reporting unit. We could be subject to additional goodwill impairment tests in the event of changes in industry and market conditions, our business and reporting structure. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we performed the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test and a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment and determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value of the underlying goodwill and a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of the reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill.\nWe recognize revenue from the sale of our products provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue when the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer. We bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point. On most orders, our terms of sale provide that title passes to the buyer upon shipment by us. In certain cases, our terms of sale may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer. Revenue related to the sale of consignment inventory at customer vendor managed locations is not recognized until the product is pulled from inventory stock by customers. Payments made to third-party sales representatives are recorded to sales and marketing expense and not a reduction of revenue as the sales agent services they provide have an identifiable benefit and are made at similar rates of other sales agent service providers.\nOperating activities\nIn 2017, the market situation for 100G and above product deployments in China materially affected our results. Demand from our China-based customers was very strong in 2016 with our customers at that time providing optimistic forecasts for 2017 in anticipation of new tenders for provincial and metro 100G system deployments from the leading Chinese telecom carriers. However, tender awards from the China telecom carriers were slower than expected, in 2017, causing demand for our products by our customers to drop significantly starting in the first quarter of 2017. We believe one or more of our leading customers in China had accumulated significant inventory prior to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. We also believe they and other customers rapidly moved to adjust their inventory by reducing their purchases of our products, beginning in the first quarter of 2017 to align with the slow market demand and their own production levels.\nIn 2018, we expect to resume growth in revenue from our High Speed Products. We also expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers.\nIn January 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (the \"Mitsubishi Bank\") and The Yamanashi Chou Bank, Ltd. for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 850 million JPY (approximately $7.8 million). The full amount of the term loan of 850 million JPY (approximately $7.8 million) was drawn in January 2018. Interest on this term loan is based upon the annual rate of the three months TIBOR rate plus 1.00%. This term loan requires quarterly interest payments, along with the principal payments, over 82 months commencing in April 2018.\nCustomers accounting for more than 10% of our total revenue and revenue from our top five customers for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets.\nResults of operations\nWe expect to continue to focus on controlling our general and administrative expense in 2018. As a percentage of total revenue, our general and administrative expense may vary as our revenue changes over time.\nTotal revenue increased by $72.0 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from our High Speed Products driven by product demand, partially in China. Our High Speed Products increased to 67% of revenue in 2016 from 58% in 2015 and our Network Products and Solutions revenue decreased from 42% in 2015 to 33% in 2016. The increase in High Speed Products revenue was partially offset by a decrease in Network Products and Solutions revenue largely due to our product phase-out efforts to improve our gross margin. In 2016, total revenue from China, the United States, Japan and rest of the world was $254.7 million, $67.8 million, $12.0 million and $76.9 million, respectively, compared to $182.5 million, $77.9 million, $12.7 million and $66.4 million, respectively, in 2015.\nWe provide warranties to cover defects in workmanship, materials and manufacturing of our products to meet stated functionality specifications. We test products against specified functionality requirements prior to delivery, but we nevertheless from time to time experience claims under our warranty guarantees. We accrue for estimated warranty costs under those guarantees based upon historical experience, and for specific items at the time their existence is known and the amounts are determinable. We charge a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities to cost of goods sold based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures. We recorded warranty expense of $1.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected.\nIn 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $32.8 million, compared to $53.8 million net cash provided by operating activities in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $48.3 million decrease in cash flows related to net loss and non-cash adjustments, $34.0 million decrease in cash flows related to decreased accounts payable, $21.0 million decrease in cash flows related to a buildup in inventories in the first half of 2017. The decreases were partially offset by a $10.7 million increase in cash flows from collection of accounts receivable primarily driven by lower revenue and strong collections and a $6.2 million increase in cash flows from accrued and other liabilities primarily relating to the TSA with APAT OE payable in the current year.\n\nCost of goods sold and gross margin\nAs of December 31, 2017, the liability for uncertain tax positions was $0.2 million. We cannot conclude on the timing of cash payments associated with our uncertain tax positions.\nIn 2016, we incurred $2.1 million in acquisition and asset sale related transaction costs related to legal, accounting and other professional services for our acquisition and asset sale activities.\nThe Wells Fargo Credit Facility provides for borrowings equal to the lower of (a) a maximum revolver amount of $50.0 million, or (b) an amount equal to 80% - 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus 100% of qualified cash balances up to $15.0 million, less certain discretionary adjustments (\"Borrowing Base\"). The maximum revolver amount may be increased by up to $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions. At closing, $50.0 million was available, of which $30.0 million was drawn. We used $20.0 million of this amount to pay the principal and interest due under the Comerica Bank Credit Facility.\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. The estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows. If our estimates regarding future cash flows derived from such assets were to change, we may record an impairment to the value of these assets.\n\nSales and marketing expense decreased by $0.8 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $2.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense compared to the 2016, which included higher stock-based compensation relating to a higher market price of our stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards, and a $1.1 decrease in commissions and other variable compensation. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.6 million provision for bad debt expense in 2017, a $1.4 million increase in salaries and related expenses and a $0.3 million increase in product promotion costs.\nAccounting for income taxes\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the non-interest bearing bank acceptance drafts issued in connection with our notes payable to our suppliers in China under these line of credit facilities had an outstanding balance of $1.6 million and $6.4 million, respectively. Compensating balances relating to these credit facilities totaled $0.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Compensating balances are classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 3 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nFinancing activities\nRusnano Rights Agreement\nprimarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer's payment history. Our estimates are based on historical experience. If the actual amounts are significantly different from our estimates, our operating results could have a material impact.\nGeneral and administrative\nOur cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost to produce wafers, modules and to manufacture and test our products. Additionally, our cost of goods sold includes stock-based compensation, write-downs of excess and obsolete inventory, royalty payments, amortization of certain purchased intangible assets, depreciation, acquisition-related fair value adjustments, restructuring cost, warranty, shipping and allocated facilities costs.\nIn September 2017, China Mobile Communications Corporation awarded tenders for new provincial deployments to Huawei, ZTE Corporation and Fiberhome. This was followed in October 2017 by the issue of tenders by China United Network Communications Group Co., Ltd., or China Unicom, and we anticipate tenders will be issued in 2018 from China Telecommunications Corp, or China Telecom. While the timing is still uncertain, it is our expectation that these tender awards as well as new tender awards should create a more normalized demand environment in 2018.\nWe have research and development and wafer fabrication facilities in San Jose and Fremont, California and in Tokyo, Japan that coordinate with our research and development and manufacturing facilities in Dongguan, Shenzhen and Wuhan, China and Ottawa, Canada. We use proprietary design tools and design-for-manufacturing techniques to align our design process with our precision nanoscale, vertically integrated manufacturing and testing. We believe we are one of the highest volume PIC manufacturers in the world and that we can further expand our manufacturing capacity to meet market needs.\nWe believe we will have sufficient resources to fund our currently planned operations and expenditures over the next twelve months without additional financing or other actions. In addition, we believe there are a number of ongoing and potential actions that may further strengthen our projected cash and projected financial position.\nRevenue recognition\nRusnano Rights Agreement\nWe develop, manufacture and sell optoelectronic products that transmit, receive and switch high speed digital optical signals for communications networks. We sell our products to the world's leading network equipment manufacturers, including Nokia (formerly Alcatel-Lucent, which was acquired by Nokia in January 2016), Ciena Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and its affiliate HiSilicon Technologies, Ltd. (collectively Huawei\u201d). These companies are among our largest customers and a focus of our strategy due to their leading market positions.\nIn 2018, we expect volume growth for our High Speed Products, although quarter-to-quarter results may show considerable variability due to customer demand fluctuations for current products as well as initial ramp-up variations on new product introductions. Similar to revenue, our gross margins may fluctuate materially depending on a variety of factors including average selling price changes, product mix, volume, manufacturing utilization and ongoing manufacturing process improvements.\nIn 2016, our stock-based stock options and stock appreciation units with market conditions vested when the average closing price of our common stock over 20 consecutive trading days exceeded $15.00 per share and we recorded approximately $5.7 million in related stock-based compensation expense within cost of goods sold and operating expenses.\naverage selling prices of our products, changes in the cost and volumes of materials purchased from our suppliers, changes in labor costs, changes in overhead costs or requirements, revaluation of stock appreciation unit awards that are impacted by our stock price, write-downs of excess and obsolete inventories and warranty costs. In addition, we periodically negotiate pricing with certain customers which can cause our gross margins to fluctuate, particularly in the quarters subsequent to the periods in which the negotiations occurred.\nOur intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense relating to technology and patents and leasehold interests are included within cost of goods sold, while customer relationships and non-compete agreements are recorded within operating expenses.\n\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $2.8 million, or 9%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in stock-based compensation, a $0.7 million increase in salaries and benefits, and a $0.4 million increase in outside services driven by legal fees, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in variable compensation expenses.\nIn 2016, amortization of purchased intangible assets was $4.5 million, comprising of $2.9 million in cost of goods sold and $1.6 million in operating expenses. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by approximately $0.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to certain intangible assets from our past acquisitions being fully amortized.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flow, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation expense, impairment analysis of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation of inventory, purchased intangibles, warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nAcquisition and asset sale related costs\nInterest and other income (expense), net\nUnder our amended rights agreement, dated June 30, 2015, with Rusnano, one of our principal stockholders, we agreed to a $30.0 million investment commitment (the Investment Commitment\u201d) toward our Russian operations. The Investment Commitment can be partially satisfied by cash and/or non-cash investment inside or outside of Russia. Our $21.0 million investment milestone for 2016 was met as of December 31, 2016. If certain of the Investment Commitments are not achieved in the indicated time frames through 2019, we have the ability to exit our Russian operations by paying an exit fee of up to $2.0 million. See Note 13, Commitments and contingencies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information.\nWe believe the market faced issues with the timing of provincial deployments and of inventory management at certain customers. The transition in China from national backbone deployments to provincial backbone and metro deployments reduces our and our customers' visibility into the timing and volumes of tender awards, as the provincial offices of the China telecom carriers are somewhat independent of their national headquarters and each other. Our revenue growth in China was restricted by reduced demand and inventory overhang, both directly with our China based customers and through the impact on some of our non-China customers who also sell to customers in China.\nWarranty liabilities\nWe record inventories at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value, after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventories in excess of anticipated future demand. In assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories, we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand, the timing of new product introductions, economic trends and market conditions. If the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted, we could be required to record additional inventory write-downs which would be charged to cost of goods sold. Obsolescence is determined from several factors, including competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles. Write-downs of excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of goods sold. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. If this lower-cost inventory is subsequently sold, it will result in lower costs and higher gross margin for those products. Any write-downs would have an adverse impact on our gross margin. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, inventory write-down charges were approximately $8.3 million, $3.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Our inventory write-down charges in 2015 included a $2.8 million charge resulting from the phasing-out of our earlier-generation tunable laser products.\nThe effective tax rate in 2016 of 106% was 60 percentage points higher than the 2015 effective tax rate mainly due to the non-recurring vesting of the stock-based awards with a market condition in 2016 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in our tax rate in China.\nOur business is focused on the highest speed digital optics and signal processing communications applications for telecom transport and Metro networks and for data center applications. In 2017, our High Speed Products for data rates of 100G and beyond comprised 83% of our revenues. In 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement for the sale of assets of our Low Speed Transceiver Products within our Network Products and Solutions product group. In 2016 and 2015, the Low Speed Transceiver Products represent approximately 15% and 27% of total revenue, respectively. The asset sale was closed in January 2017.\nIn January 2017, we completed the sale of certain Low Speed Transceiver Products' assets for approximately $25.0 million in consideration plus approximately $1.4 million for a post-closing transition services arrangement. The consideration was reduced by $3.4 million for inventory adjustment after closing to approximately $21.6 million, which was subject to other adjustments of up to $10.0 million for any potential claims. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nmarketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation and sales commissions, costs related to sales and marketing programs and services and facility costs. As a percentage of total revenue, our sales and marketing expense may vary as our revenue changes over time.\nRevenue\nRecognizing our focus on growth in our 100Gbps ( 100G\u201d) and beyond products, we align our product group reporting to High Speed Products\u201d which includes products designed for 100G and beyond applications and Network Products and Solutions,\u201d which comprises all products designed for applications below 100G. In 2017 and 2016, High Speed Products represented approximately 83% and 67% of total revenue, respectively. In 2016, High Speed products were 82% of our proforma revenue when the revenue from our low speed transceiver products, sold in January 2017, is excluded. Network Products and Solutions represented approximately 17% and 33% of total revenue, in 2017 and 2016 respectively, and represented 18% of our proforma revenue in 2016 when the sold low speed transceiver products are excluded.\n\n (2) See Note 12, Pension Plans, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information regarding our retirement obligations. \nBusiness Combinations", "item_7_text": "Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.\nTotal revenue decreased by $118.5 million, or 29%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was approximately equally attributable to a reduction in demand from China telecom carrier tender awards with an inventory overhang at our Chinese customers as described further in the section entitled \"Business overview\" above and lower revenue that resulted from the sale of assets related to our Low Speed Transceiver Products in January 2017. Revenue generated by Low Speed Transceiver Products before the asset sale was $1.5 million in 2017, compared to $63.6 million in 2016. In 2017, High Speed Products\nOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which generally results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including any contingent consideration.\nThese market developments in China have adversely affected our revenues, operating results and financial condition in 2017, as further addressed below.\nGeneral and administrative expense was flat in 2017 as compared to 2016. Increases included a $1.8 million increase in audit and accounting related fees and a $1.5 million increase in professional and legal expenses. These increases were offset by a $2.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense compared to the 2016, which included higher stock-based compensation relating to a higher market price of our stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards and $1.5 million decrease in variable compensation.\nrespectively. Additionally, we recorded a charge of $2.0 million to cost of goods sold in 2017 for discontinued product inventory write-downs related our decisions to end-of-life certain products.\nThe effective tax rate was (2)% in 2017 as compared to 106% in 2016 mainly due to lower earnings in foreign jurisdictions and increase in net loss generated in the U.S. in 2017.\nIn 2016, gross profit increased $18.1 million, or 18%, to $117.1 million in 2016, compared to $99.1 million in 2015, primarily attributable to revenue growth, volume increase and cost reduction, partially offset by lower pricing, higher stock-based compensation expense and an unfavorable cost of goods sold impact as a result of the unrecoverable inventory associated with the bankruptcy reorganization by one of our distributors.\n\nInterest and other income, net decreased $2.4 million, or 87%, in 2016 from $0.9 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $3.5 million decrease in other income, net driven by foreign exchange loss resulting from a weaker RMB and a stronger JPY against the U.S. dollars, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in interest expense and a $0.2 million increase in interest income.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit agreement with Wells Fargo, was $20.0 million of which $5.0 million is required to be maintained as unused borrowing capacity. As of December 31, 2017, we also have approximately $5.5 million available for short-term borrowings under two line of credit agreements in China that expire in July 2019 and approximately $37.9 million under third line of credit agreement with CITIC Bank in China that expires in November 2018. As of December 31, 2017, $17.0 million was due to CITIC Bank under an old line of credit, which was repaid in January 2018. Additionally, we had $6.0 million of current portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2017, of which we paid $4.4 million in January 2018 and plan to pay out the remaining current portion of long-term debt out of our existing available cash. As noted above, in January 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with Mitsubishi Bank and The Yamanashi Chou Bank, Ltd. for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 850 million JPY (approximately $7.8 million). In February 2018, we borrowed $17.0 million under third line of credit agreement with CITIC Bank in China that expires in November 2018.\nWe believe that investments in research and development are important to help meet our strategic objectives. In 2018, we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities, including new products that we believe will further enhance our competitive position. Research and development expense consists of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, for our research and development personnel, and product development costs, including engineering services, development software and hardware tools, depreciation of equipment and facility costs. We record all research and development expense as incurred. As a percentage of total revenue, our research and development expense may vary as our investment and revenue levels change over time.\nWe make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that the adjustment is determined to be required.\n (7) We calculate the expected interest payments based on our long-term debt at prevailing interest rates as of December 31, 2017.  Uncertain Tax Positions\nrepresented approximately 83% of total revenue, compared to 67% of total revenue in 2016 while Network Products and Solutions represented approximately 17% of total revenue in 2017, compared to approximately 33% of total revenue in 2016, which included Low Speed Transceiver Products. In 2017, revenue from China, United States, Japan and rest of the world was 55%, 14%, 3%, and 28% of total revenue, respectively, compared to 62%, 16%, 3%, and 19% of total revenue respectively, in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $110.8 million, including total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash of $93.9 million. Approximately 31% of our total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash were held by our foreign entities, including approximately $25.9 million in accounts held by our subsidiaries in China, of which $2.7 million was in restricted cash, and approximately $2.7 million in accounts held by our subsidiary in Japan. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash held outside of the U.S. may be subject to taxes if repatriated and may not be immediately available for our working capital needs.\nWe record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally we consider all expected future events, other than enactments or changes in tax law or rates. We provide valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $29.6 million, a $26.6 million increase compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $62.2 million increase in net proceeds from bank and acquisition-related loans, a $45.6 million net proceeds from issuance of common stock in public offering, partially offset by a $75.6 million decrease in loans and acquisition-related loan payments, a $4.0 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of notes payable and a $3.4 million decrease in the repayments of notes payable.\nThe Credit Facility agreement requires prepayment of the borrowings to the extent the outstanding balance is greater than the lesser of (a) the most recently calculated Borrowing Base, or (b) the maximum revolver amount. The Borrowing Base calculation contains a customary provision that gives the lender the ability to reduce the Borrowing Base by reserves that are subjectively determinable, which is considered a subjective acceleration clause. We are required to maintain a combination of certain defined cash balances and unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of at least $20.0 million, of which at least $5.0 million must be unused borrowing capacity. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. We were in compliance with the covenants of this Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was $30.0 million and the weighted average rate under the LIBOR option was 3.29%. The remaining borrowing capacity was $20.0 million of which $5.0 million is required to be maintained as unused borrowing capacity.\nWe recognize the fair value over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. Stock-based compensation expense includes the impact of estimated forfeitures. We estimate future forfeitures at the date of grant and revise the estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nWe operate in an industry that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate with certainty. Future declines in China market demand or other changes to our forecasts could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As a result, we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund our operations. Any additional debt arrangements may\nWe focus our research and development effort primarily on the high speed market. Research and development expense increased $0.9 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in salaries and related expenses, a $1.2 million increase in facilities-related cost and $0.8 million increase in depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense compared to the 2016, which included higher stock-based compensation relating to a higher market price of our stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards and a $1.3 million decrease in variable compensation.\n (6) We have an asset retirement obligation of $3.1 million associated with our facility lease in California which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. We also have a $0.1 million asset retirement obligation in Japan. \nGoodwill and long-lived assets\nWe grant stock options, stock appreciation units and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. Stock purchase rights are granted to our employees. Stock-based awards are accounted for at fair value as of the measurement date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, the lattice-binominal option-pricing model or stock prices. For stock options and restricted stock units, the measurement date is the grant date and for employee stock purchase rights the measurement date is the first day of the offering period. Stock appreciation units are subject to re-measurement each reporting period.\nWe sell substantially all of our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. We price our products based on market and competitive conditions and may periodically reduce the price of our products as market and competitive conditions change and as manufacturing costs are reduced. Our sales transactions to customers are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, with some portions in Chinese Renminbi ( RMB\u201d) and Japanese Yen ( JPY\u201d). Revenue is driven by the volume of shipments and may be impacted by pricing pressures. We have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers.\nInvesting activities\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nStock-based compensation expense\nIn September 2017 we entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\"Wells Fargo\") as the administrative agent for a lender group (the \"Wells Fargo Credit Facility\" or \"Credit Facility\"), and the $20.0 million amount outstanding under our Comerica Bank Credit Facility, which has since been terminated, was paid in full.\n\n (4) This is an estimate of the amount outstanding under open purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other goods at December 31, 2017. Certain of these open purchase orders may be cancellable without penalty. \nResearch and development expense increased $12.8 million, or 29%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.1 million increase in development expenses largely driven by prototype and material spending, a $3.0 million increase in salaries and benefits, a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation and a $1.7 million increase in consulting fees for new product development.\nanalysis, and as a result of net operating loss carry forward available to fully offset the anticipated transition tax, we believe there will be no income tax effect in the current period.\nAsset impairment charge\nGeneral and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, for our finance, human resources and information technology personnel and certain executive officers, as well as professional services costs related to accounting, tax, banking, legal and information technology services, depreciation and facility costs.\nFair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Such assumptions are believed to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nInterest and other income (expense), net consists of interest income, interest expense and other income, net. Interest income consists of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest expense consists of amounts incurred for interest on our outstanding debt. Other income, net includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses along with government subsidies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in China and Japan is the RMB and the JPY, respectively.\nIn 2017, amortization of purchased intangible assets was $1.3 million, comprising of $0.8 million in cost of goods sold and $0.5 million in operating expenses. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by approximately $3.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2016.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $26.1 million, a $26.6 million increase compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $23.4 million increase in net income, a $15.8 million increase driven by lower accounts receivable due to collections, a $5.7 million increase in accrued and other liabilities, a $4.2 million increase in prepaid and other assets, partially offset by a $19.9 million decrease related to inventory increases due to anticipated demand and a $5.7 million decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nIn 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $49.5 million, a $27.6 million increase compared to $21.9 million used in 2015. The increase in net cash used in investment activities was primarily attributable to a $45.6 million increase in purchased marketable securities, a $34.9 million increase in property, plant and equipment purchases to meet our product demand, a $10.8 million increase as a result of a large restricted cash decrease in 2015 and a $1.6 million increase due to\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nIncome taxes and effective tax rates\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis by our management of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nThere were no restructuring charges in 2016. We recorded $0.2 million in related restructuring charges in 2015, within cost of goods sold and operating expenses.\nIn connection with our April 2012 common stock private placement transaction, we entered into a rights agreement with Rusnano. Refer to the discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Rusnano Rights Agreement\u201d section.\nlikely require regular interest or principal payments which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that additional debt or equity capital will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology; and discount rates.\nSales and marketing\nIn December 2017, the U.S. President signed into U.S. law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\"). The new legislation, among other provisions, will lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition to applying the new lower corporate tax rate in 2018 and thereafter to any taxable income we may have, the legislation affects the way we can use and carry forward net operating losses previously accumulated and results in a revaluation of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet. Given that the deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance, we believe these changes will have no net impact on our financial position and net loss. However, if and when we become profitable, we will receive a reduced benefit from such deferred tax assets. In addition, the Tax Reform includes a one-time mandatory repatriation transition tax on the net accumulated earnings and profits of a US taxpayer's foreign subsidiaries. We have performed an earnings and profits\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had three loan arrangements with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (collectively the Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans\u201d). One of Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans requires interest only payments until the maturity date of February 23, 2018, with a lump sum payment of the aggregate principal amount on the maturity date while the other requires equal monthly payments of principal equal to 8,333,000 JPY until the maturity date of February 25, 2025, with a lump sum payment of the balance of 8,373,000 JPY on the maturity date. Interest on these loans accrues and is paid monthly based upon the annual rate of the monthly Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate (TIBOR) plus 1.40% and is secured by real estate collateral. The third term loan of 690 million JPY (approximately $6.2 million) (the 2017 Mitsubishi Bank Loan\u201d) was entered into in March 2017 to acquire manufacturing equipment for our Japanese subsidiary and has an annual interest rate of the monthly TIBOR rate plus 1.00%. The 2017 Mitsubishi Bank Loan requires monthly interest and principal payments over 72 months commencing in April 2018. This loan is available from March 31, 2017 to March 30, 2018 and 690 million JPY (approximately $6.1 million) under this loan was fully drawn as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, our total outstanding principal balance under the Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans was 1.9 billion JPY (approximately $16.9 million). See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report. In January 2018, we repaid one of the Mitsubishi Bank Term Loans of 500 million JPY (approximately $4.4 million).\n\nRestructuring charges\nLiquidity and capital resources\nResearch and development\nIn 2017, we initiated restructuring actions in order to focus on key growth initiatives and to achieve a lower break even revenue level through lower operating expenses and manufacturing costs. Actions included a reduction in force, facilities consolidation and certain asset-related adjustments. These actions are expected to reduce quarterly operating expenses and costs of goods sold by approximately $2.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively, when fully realized in the first quarter of 2018. We recorded $0.8 million and $3.9 million in restructuring charges within cost of goods sold and operating expenses in in 2017,\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\nIn 2017, gross profit decreased $55.7 million, or 48%, to $61.5 million in 2017, compared to $117.1 million in 2016. Our gross margin percent decreased by approximately eight percentage points to 21% in 2017 as compared to 2016. Approximately 6 percentage points of the decline in gross margin was driven by under-utilization attributable to lower volumes in our manufacturing plants, approximately 1.6 percentage points of the decline was due to inventory write-downs and reserves for non-cancelable purchase orders associated with excess inventory related to the demand reductions from China based customers and higher warranty reserves related to a quality rework requirement. These production volume declines were driven by: (a) lower end customer demand and therefore the need to decrease production and reduce inventory; and (b) lower output volumes at our wafer fabrication facility in Japan due to lower yields where we had end customer demand but could not support the demand with production output. Approximately 1 percentage point of the decline was driven by restructuring costs and discontinued product inventory write-downs related to our decisions to end-of life certain products. These gross margin reductions were offset by lower intangible amortization and stock-based compensation charges in 2017 which contributed 1.4 percentage points of improvement.\nApproximately $8.8 million of our retained earnings within our total accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2017 was subject to restrictions due to the fact that our subsidiaries in China are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year end to fund statutory common reserves as well as allocate a discretionary portion of their after-tax profits to their staff welfare and bonus fund. This restricted amount is not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation.\nInterest expense included in interest and other income (expense), increased in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in interest expense was due to increase in outstanding borrowings during 2017.\nOur gross margin percent decreased by approximately one percentage point to 28.5% in 2016 from 29.2% in 2015, primarily attributable to a $1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and $1.4 million of unfavorable cost of goods sold impact as a result of the unrecoverable inventory associated with the bankruptcy reorganization by one of our distributors and lower pricing, partially offset by production cost reduction and favorable product mix resulting from an increase in sales volume of our High Speed Products.\nOperating expenses\nValuation of inventories\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe acquired the tunable laser product lines of EMCORE Corporation in January 2015 and the optical power monitoring business of EigenLight Corporation in November 2015 and the results of operations from these acquisitions are included from the date of acquisition.\nIn December 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement\u201d) with APAT Optoelectronics Components Co., Ltd. (the Purchaser\u201d) for the sale of certain assets of our access and low speed transceiver product lines (the Low Speed Transceiver Products\u201d) which was completed in January 2017. All of these products were part of our Network Products and Solutions group and include the low speed passive optical network, or PON, products for which the end-of-life plan was announced in mid-2016. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Low Speed Transceiver Products generated approximately 1%, 15% and 27% of our total revenue, respectively.\n (1) See Note 11, Debt, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information regarding our debt. \n (3) We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our offices in China, U.S. and Canada. \nIn 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $21.9 million, an $8.0 million increase compared to $13.9 million used in 2014. The increase in net cash used in investment activities was primarily attributable to a $27.5 million increase in purchased marketable securities, a $5.8 million increase in property, plant and equipment purchases and a $5.4 million reduction in proceeds from maturity of securities, partially offset by a $21.0 million increase as a result of decreases in restricted cash balances and an $8.5 million increase in proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nThe amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgement. Contracts and/or customer purchase orders are assessed to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectability based\nContractual obligations and commitments\nSales and marketing expense increased by $2.8 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $1.0 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $0.6 million increase in commission expense, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in bad debt provision largely due to collections.\nBusiness overview\nIn 2017, we incurred $0.1 million in acquisition and asset sale related transaction costs related to legal, accounting and other professional services.\nWe expect to continue to expand our high speed market focus and increase sales coverage of DCI market while controlling our sales and marketing expenses in 2018, even as our business continues to expand geographically. Sales and\n (5) See Note 13, Commitments and contingencies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information regarding our Rusnano Payment Derivative. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\n\nWe expect that our gross profit and gross margin are likely to increase in 2018 due to a variety of factors, including favorable product mix, vertical integration, reduced amortization expense for purchased intangible assets and introduction of new products. Other factors that can affect our gross margin include production volume, inventory changes, changes in the\nIn 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.5 million, a $26.1 million decrease compared to $29.6 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $45.8 million decrease largely attributable to the $45.6 million net proceeds from our follow-on public offering in 2015, a $5.2 million decrease related to lower net proceeds from issuance of notes payable and a $2.1 million decrease in repayments of bank and acquisition-related loans, partially offset by a $14.9 million increase in proceeds from bank loans and a $7.5 million increase due to lower repayments of notes payable and a $3.9 million increase due to higher proceeds from exercise of stock options and issuance of stock under employee stock purchase plan primarily attributable higher average common stock price in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $53.8 million, a $27.7 million increase compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $27.8 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments, a $13.6 million increase attributable to inventory shipments driven by product demand and a $1.8 million increase in net income net of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease related to higher prepaid and other assets primarily due to a reduction in prepaid taxes in 2015, a $6.0 million decrease related to lower accrued and other liabilities balance primarily due to variable compensation accrual for 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn 2017, we generated operating losses of $51.4 million and negative cash flows from operations of $32.8 million. We had an accumulated deficit of $352.0 million as of December 31, 2017. Our operating results and cash flows during this period have been negatively affected by reduced demand in China stemming from delayed provincial deployments and a buildup of inventory at one or more of our leading customers, which is expected to continue into early 2018. In response, we implemented restructuring plans in May and September 2017 that included a reduction in force and consolidation of facilities, which are expected to reduce quarterly expenses by approximately $2.6 million when fully realized in the first quarter of 2018. We also reduced or delayed certain product development projects and capital expenditures, aggressively pursued collections of accounts and notes receivable and continued to closely manage production and inventory levels.\nThere were no asset impairment charges in 2017 and 2016. In 2015, we recognized asset impairment charges of $0.4 million of which $0.2 million was attributable to a write-down of held-for-sale assets acquired from EMCORE and $0.2 million was attributable to charges for equipment related to our product phase out effort.\nThe table below sets forth selected cash flow data for the periods presented:\nforeign currency hedge settlement payments, partially offset by a $45.7 million increase in proceeds from sales of marketable securities, a $19.1 million increase in proceeds from maturity of securities and a $0.4 million reduction in cash used in business acquisition compared to 2015.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nIn 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $15.7 million, a $33.8 million decrease compared to $49.5 million used in 2016. The decrease in net cash used in investment activities was primarily attributable to a $21.6 million in proceeds from the sale of our Low Speed Transceiver Products' assets in January 2017 and a $4.3 million decrease in property, plant and equipment purchases in 2017.\nWe regularly issue short-term notes payable to our suppliers in China in exchange for accounts payable. These notes are supported by non-interest bearing bank acceptance drafts and are due three to six months after issuance. As a condition of the notes payable arrangements, we are required to keep a compensating balance at the issuing banks that is a percentage of the total notes payable balance until the amounts are settled. As of December 31, 2017, our subsidiary in China had three line of credit facilities with banking institutions. The total amount available for short-term borrowings under these line of credit facilities as of December 31, 2017 was $43.4 million. In July 2017, we borrowed $17.0 million under a line of credit facility with CITIC Bank which was repaid when due in January 2018. This line of credit facility expired in September 2017, but was renewed in December 2017 with a new expiration date of November 2018. In February 2018, we borrowed $17.0 million from CITIC Bank under the credit facility.\nThe following table presents certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue:\nDetermining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rates and expected life. If any of these assumptions, or the market price of our common shares, used in the option-pricing models change, our stock-based compensation expense could materially change our consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2017, our income tax provision was primarily related to the operating profit realized in our foreign subsidiaries in Japan and China. Historically, we have experienced net losses in the U.S. and in the short term, we expect this trend to continue.\nIn 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $43.1 million, a $39.6 million increase compared to $3.5 million in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to $30.0 million in new borrowing under our Wells Fargo Credit Facility ($10.0 million net of repayment of $20.0 million owed under the Comerica Bank Credit Facility), and $34.0 million from notes payable to banks in China.\n\nIn 2016, our income tax provision was primarily related to the operating profit realized in our foreign subsidiaries in Japan and China. Historically, we have experienced net losses in the U.S. and in the short term, we expect this trend to continue. In China, one of our subsidiaries changed from a preferential 15% tax rate available for high technology enterprises to 25% for 2016. The preferential rate applied to 2015 and 2014. We realized benefits from this 10% reduction in the tax rate of $0.9 million and $0.5 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFrom time to time we accept notes receivable in exchange for accounts receivable from certain of our customers in China. These notes receivable are non-interest bearing and are generally due within six months. Historically, we have collected on the notes receivable in full at the time of maturity.\n (1) Huawei's percentage of revenue included its affiliate, HiSilicon. Revenue from HiSilicon represented approximately 37%, 36% and 23% of total revenue, respectively, in 2017, 2016 and 2015.  For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our percentage of sales from our China-based subsidiaries, the majority of which were denominated in RMB, were 1%, 4% and 5%, respectively.\nIn 2015, we incurred $0.9 million in acquisition-related transaction costs related to legal, accounting and other professional services for our acquisition activities, including our acquisitions of EMCORE's tunable laser product lines and EigenLight's optical power monitoring business.\nThe Credit Facility matures on June 30, 2022 and borrowings bear interest at an interest rate option of either (a) the LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 1.75% per annum, or (b) the prime lending rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.50% to 0.75% per annum. We are also required to pay a commitment fee equal to 0.25% of the unused portion of the Credit Facility.\n____________________________________________\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\nCash flow discussion\nIn 2017, our revenue decline of 29% compared to 2016 was driven primarily due to a reduction in demand from China market as described above and lower revenue that resulted from the sale of assets related to our Low Speed Transceiver Products' assets in January 2017. Excluding the Low Speed Transceiver Products, our revenue in 2017 declined 16% compared to 2016. Our gross margin was 21.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 28.5% in the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in gross margin year over year was primarily attributable to under-utilization due to lower volumes in our manufacturing plants, inventory write-downs and reserves for non-cancelable purchase orders associated with excess inventory related to the demand reductions from China based customers, higher warranty reserves related to a quality rework requirement, lower yields at our wafer fabrication facility in Japan, restructuring costs and discontinued product inventory write-downs related to our decisions to end-of life certain products, partially offset by lower intangible amortization and stock-based compensation charges in 2017.\nThe asset sale consists of approximately $25.0 million in cash consideration plus approximately $1.4 million post-closing transition services under a transition services agreement (\"TSA\") with the Purchaser. We recognized a $2.2 million gain on the sale of these assets within operating loss in 2017. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nWe perform annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth fiscal quarter by reporting unit. We could be subject to additional goodwill impairment tests in the event of changes in industry and market conditions, our business and reporting structure. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we performed the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test and a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment and determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value of the underlying goodwill and a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of the reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill.\nWe recognize revenue from the sale of our products provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue when the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer. We bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point. On most orders, our terms of sale provide that title passes to the buyer upon shipment by us. In certain cases, our terms of sale may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer. Revenue related to the sale of consignment inventory at customer vendor managed locations is not recognized until the product is pulled from inventory stock by customers. Payments made to third-party sales representatives are recorded to sales and marketing expense and not a reduction of revenue as the sales agent services they provide have an identifiable benefit and are made at similar rates of other sales agent service providers.\nOperating activities\nIn 2017, the market situation for 100G and above product deployments in China materially affected our results. Demand from our China-based customers was very strong in 2016 with our customers at that time providing optimistic forecasts for 2017 in anticipation of new tenders for provincial and metro 100G system deployments from the leading Chinese telecom carriers. However, tender awards from the China telecom carriers were slower than expected, in 2017, causing demand for our products by our customers to drop significantly starting in the first quarter of 2017. We believe one or more of our leading customers in China had accumulated significant inventory prior to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. We also believe they and other customers rapidly moved to adjust their inventory by reducing their purchases of our products, beginning in the first quarter of 2017 to align with the slow market demand and their own production levels.\nIn 2018, we expect to resume growth in revenue from our High Speed Products. We also expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers.\nIn January 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (the \"Mitsubishi Bank\") and The Yamanashi Chou Bank, Ltd. for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 850 million JPY (approximately $7.8 million). The full amount of the term loan of 850 million JPY (approximately $7.8 million) was drawn in January 2018. Interest on this term loan is based upon the annual rate of the three months TIBOR rate plus 1.00%. This term loan requires quarterly interest payments, along with the principal payments, over 82 months commencing in April 2018.\nCustomers accounting for more than 10% of our total revenue and revenue from our top five customers for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets.\nResults of operations\nWe expect to continue to focus on controlling our general and administrative expense in 2018. As a percentage of total revenue, our general and administrative expense may vary as our revenue changes over time.\nTotal revenue increased by $72.0 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from our High Speed Products driven by product demand, partially in China. Our High Speed Products increased to 67% of revenue in 2016 from 58% in 2015 and our Network Products and Solutions revenue decreased from 42% in 2015 to 33% in 2016. The increase in High Speed Products revenue was partially offset by a decrease in Network Products and Solutions revenue largely due to our product phase-out efforts to improve our gross margin. In 2016, total revenue from China, the United States, Japan and rest of the world was $254.7 million, $67.8 million, $12.0 million and $76.9 million, respectively, compared to $182.5 million, $77.9 million, $12.7 million and $66.4 million, respectively, in 2015.\nWe provide warranties to cover defects in workmanship, materials and manufacturing of our products to meet stated functionality specifications. We test products against specified functionality requirements prior to delivery, but we nevertheless from time to time experience claims under our warranty guarantees. We accrue for estimated warranty costs under those guarantees based upon historical experience, and for specific items at the time their existence is known and the amounts are determinable. We charge a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities to cost of goods sold based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures. We recorded warranty expense of $1.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected.\nIn 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $32.8 million, compared to $53.8 million net cash provided by operating activities in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $48.3 million decrease in cash flows related to net loss and non-cash adjustments, $34.0 million decrease in cash flows related to decreased accounts payable, $21.0 million decrease in cash flows related to a buildup in inventories in the first half of 2017. The decreases were partially offset by a $10.7 million increase in cash flows from collection of accounts receivable primarily driven by lower revenue and strong collections and a $6.2 million increase in cash flows from accrued and other liabilities primarily relating to the TSA with APAT OE payable in the current year.\n\nCost of goods sold and gross margin\nAs of December 31, 2017, the liability for uncertain tax positions was $0.2 million. We cannot conclude on the timing of cash payments associated with our uncertain tax positions.\nIn 2016, we incurred $2.1 million in acquisition and asset sale related transaction costs related to legal, accounting and other professional services for our acquisition and asset sale activities.\nThe Wells Fargo Credit Facility provides for borrowings equal to the lower of (a) a maximum revolver amount of $50.0 million, or (b) an amount equal to 80% - 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus 100% of qualified cash balances up to $15.0 million, less certain discretionary adjustments (\"Borrowing Base\"). The maximum revolver amount may be increased by up to $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions. At closing, $50.0 million was available, of which $30.0 million was drawn. We used $20.0 million of this amount to pay the principal and interest due under the Comerica Bank Credit Facility.\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. The estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows. If our estimates regarding future cash flows derived from such assets were to change, we may record an impairment to the value of these assets.\n\nSales and marketing expense decreased by $0.8 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $2.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense compared to the 2016, which included higher stock-based compensation relating to a higher market price of our stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards, and a $1.1 decrease in commissions and other variable compensation. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.6 million provision for bad debt expense in 2017, a $1.4 million increase in salaries and related expenses and a $0.3 million increase in product promotion costs.\nAccounting for income taxes\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the non-interest bearing bank acceptance drafts issued in connection with our notes payable to our suppliers in China under these line of credit facilities had an outstanding balance of $1.6 million and $6.4 million, respectively. Compensating balances relating to these credit facilities totaled $0.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Compensating balances are classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 3 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nFinancing activities\nRusnano Rights Agreement\nprimarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer's payment history. Our estimates are based on historical experience. If the actual amounts are significantly different from our estimates, our operating results could have a material impact.\nGeneral and administrative\nOur cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost to produce wafers, modules and to manufacture and test our products. Additionally, our cost of goods sold includes stock-based compensation, write-downs of excess and obsolete inventory, royalty payments, amortization of certain purchased intangible assets, depreciation, acquisition-related fair value adjustments, restructuring cost, warranty, shipping and allocated facilities costs.\nIn September 2017, China Mobile Communications Corporation awarded tenders for new provincial deployments to Huawei, ZTE Corporation and Fiberhome. This was followed in October 2017 by the issue of tenders by China United Network Communications Group Co., Ltd., or China Unicom, and we anticipate tenders will be issued in 2018 from China Telecommunications Corp, or China Telecom. While the timing is still uncertain, it is our expectation that these tender awards as well as new tender awards should create a more normalized demand environment in 2018.\nWe have research and development and wafer fabrication facilities in San Jose and Fremont, California and in Tokyo, Japan that coordinate with our research and development and manufacturing facilities in Dongguan, Shenzhen and Wuhan, China and Ottawa, Canada. We use proprietary design tools and design-for-manufacturing techniques to align our design process with our precision nanoscale, vertically integrated manufacturing and testing. We believe we are one of the highest volume PIC manufacturers in the world and that we can further expand our manufacturing capacity to meet market needs.\nWe believe we will have sufficient resources to fund our currently planned operations and expenditures over the next twelve months without additional financing or other actions. In addition, we believe there are a number of ongoing and potential actions that may further strengthen our projected cash and projected financial position.\nRevenue recognition\nRusnano Rights Agreement\nWe develop, manufacture and sell optoelectronic products that transmit, receive and switch high speed digital optical signals for communications networks. We sell our products to the world's leading network equipment manufacturers, including Nokia (formerly Alcatel-Lucent, which was acquired by Nokia in January 2016), Ciena Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and its affiliate HiSilicon Technologies, Ltd. (collectively Huawei\u201d). These companies are among our largest customers and a focus of our strategy due to their leading market positions.\nIn 2018, we expect volume growth for our High Speed Products, although quarter-to-quarter results may show considerable variability due to customer demand fluctuations for current products as well as initial ramp-up variations on new product introductions. Similar to revenue, our gross margins may fluctuate materially depending on a variety of factors including average selling price changes, product mix, volume, manufacturing utilization and ongoing manufacturing process improvements.\nIn 2016, our stock-based stock options and stock appreciation units with market conditions vested when the average closing price of our common stock over 20 consecutive trading days exceeded $15.00 per share and we recorded approximately $5.7 million in related stock-based compensation expense within cost of goods sold and operating expenses.\naverage selling prices of our products, changes in the cost and volumes of materials purchased from our suppliers, changes in labor costs, changes in overhead costs or requirements, revaluation of stock appreciation unit awards that are impacted by our stock price, write-downs of excess and obsolete inventories and warranty costs. In addition, we periodically negotiate pricing with certain customers which can cause our gross margins to fluctuate, particularly in the quarters subsequent to the periods in which the negotiations occurred.\nOur intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense relating to technology and patents and leasehold interests are included within cost of goods sold, while customer relationships and non-compete agreements are recorded within operating expenses.\n\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $2.8 million, or 9%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in stock-based compensation, a $0.7 million increase in salaries and benefits, and a $0.4 million increase in outside services driven by legal fees, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in variable compensation expenses.\nIn 2016, amortization of purchased intangible assets was $4.5 million, comprising of $2.9 million in cost of goods sold and $1.6 million in operating expenses. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by approximately $0.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to certain intangible assets from our past acquisitions being fully amortized.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flow, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation expense, impairment analysis of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation of inventory, purchased intangibles, warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nAcquisition and asset sale related costs\nInterest and other income (expense), net\nUnder our amended rights agreement, dated June 30, 2015, with Rusnano, one of our principal stockholders, we agreed to a $30.0 million investment commitment (the Investment Commitment\u201d) toward our Russian operations. The Investment Commitment can be partially satisfied by cash and/or non-cash investment inside or outside of Russia. Our $21.0 million investment milestone for 2016 was met as of December 31, 2016. If certain of the Investment Commitments are not achieved in the indicated time frames through 2019, we have the ability to exit our Russian operations by paying an exit fee of up to $2.0 million. See Note 13, Commitments and contingencies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information.\nWe believe the market faced issues with the timing of provincial deployments and of inventory management at certain customers. The transition in China from national backbone deployments to provincial backbone and metro deployments reduces our and our customers' visibility into the timing and volumes of tender awards, as the provincial offices of the China telecom carriers are somewhat independent of their national headquarters and each other. Our revenue growth in China was restricted by reduced demand and inventory overhang, both directly with our China based customers and through the impact on some of our non-China customers who also sell to customers in China.\nWarranty liabilities\nWe record inventories at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value, after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventories in excess of anticipated future demand. In assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories, we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand, the timing of new product introductions, economic trends and market conditions. If the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted, we could be required to record additional inventory write-downs which would be charged to cost of goods sold. Obsolescence is determined from several factors, including competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles. Write-downs of excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of goods sold. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. If this lower-cost inventory is subsequently sold, it will result in lower costs and higher gross margin for those products. Any write-downs would have an adverse impact on our gross margin. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, inventory write-down charges were approximately $8.3 million, $3.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Our inventory write-down charges in 2015 included a $2.8 million charge resulting from the phasing-out of our earlier-generation tunable laser products.\nThe effective tax rate in 2016 of 106% was 60 percentage points higher than the 2015 effective tax rate mainly due to the non-recurring vesting of the stock-based awards with a market condition in 2016 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in our tax rate in China.\nOur business is focused on the highest speed digital optics and signal processing communications applications for telecom transport and Metro networks and for data center applications. In 2017, our High Speed Products for data rates of 100G and beyond comprised 83% of our revenues. In 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement for the sale of assets of our Low Speed Transceiver Products within our Network Products and Solutions product group. In 2016 and 2015, the Low Speed Transceiver Products represent approximately 15% and 27% of total revenue, respectively. The asset sale was closed in January 2017.\nIn January 2017, we completed the sale of certain Low Speed Transceiver Products' assets for approximately $25.0 million in consideration plus approximately $1.4 million for a post-closing transition services arrangement. The consideration was reduced by $3.4 million for inventory adjustment after closing to approximately $21.6 million, which was subject to other adjustments of up to $10.0 million for any potential claims. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nmarketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation and sales commissions, costs related to sales and marketing programs and services and facility costs. As a percentage of total revenue, our sales and marketing expense may vary as our revenue changes over time.\nRevenue\nRecognizing our focus on growth in our 100Gbps ( 100G\u201d) and beyond products, we align our product group reporting to High Speed Products\u201d which includes products designed for 100G and beyond applications and Network Products and Solutions,\u201d which comprises all products designed for applications below 100G. In 2017 and 2016, High Speed Products represented approximately 83% and 67% of total revenue, respectively. In 2016, High Speed products were 82% of our proforma revenue when the revenue from our low speed transceiver products, sold in January 2017, is excluded. Network Products and Solutions represented approximately 17% and 33% of total revenue, in 2017 and 2016 respectively, and represented 18% of our proforma revenue in 2016 when the sold low speed transceiver products are excluded.\n\n (2) See Note 12, Pension Plans, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information regarding our

reduced demand from China due to slower provincial deployments and inventory overhang at customers. This caused gross margin to decline from 28.5% in 2016 to 21% in 2017. \n\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 27% in 2016 to 39% in 2017, primarily due to the revenue decline.\n\n- Net loss was 18% of revenue in 2017 compared to breakeven in 2016. \n\n- Cash flow from operations was negative $32.8 million in 2017 compared to positive $53.8 million in 2016, mainly due to the net loss and reduced accounts payable. \n\n- Intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense decreased by $3.2 million in 2017 as some intangibles became fully amortized. \n\n- The company has debt facilities and credit lines available in the U.S., China and Japan. The Wells Fargo credit facility was expanded to $50 million in 2017.\n\n- The company expects a return to revenue growth in 2018 for its high speed products as new China tenders are awarded. Margin improvement is also expected from new products and manufacturing improvements.\n\nIn summary, the company faced challenging market conditions in China in 2017 but is positioned for improved performance in 2018 based on new product introductions and China tender awards. Cost management initiatives were implemented in 2017 to reduce the breakeven revenue level."}
